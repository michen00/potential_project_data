1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,932
Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,728
We're having a bag ball.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,144
Joey Jay.

4
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:07,904
I can tell by looking at this

5
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:09,354
you're not the sewer.

6
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:10,941
LaLa Ri.

7
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,565
It's some bags that
were glued onto a bodysuit.

8
00:00:13,634 --> 00:00:14,842
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

9
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,981
Utica.

10
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,501
You have continuously
upped the fashion,

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,892
and I think tonight
was no exception.

12
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:21,745
Gottmik.

13
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,471
You have a really good
taste level

14
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,026
that transcended
all three of the looks.

15
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:28,487
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

16
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:30,340
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,308
LaLa Ri, shantay you stay.

18
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:35,828
Joey Jay, sashay away.

19
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:46,805
- Whew!
- My Lord.

20
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,807
That was a long runway.

21
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:51,120
Category is our clothes.

22
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:53,122
What a day.

23
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:57,919
My boyfriend-to-be
was just sent home, Joey Jay.

24
00:00:57,988 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm so sad!

25
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:02,924
"I'm a gay-ass bitch. I'm who?

26
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:05,099
- Joey Jay."
- Joey Jay."

27
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:06,490
So, LaLa, I'm not
gonna come for you,

28
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:08,309
but you sent my man home.

29
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,311
Listen, bitch, Joey's cute,

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,140
and I definitely have
a big-ass crush on him,

31
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:13,452
and I most for sure

32
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,523
will sleep with the bitch
when we meet again

33
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:16,752
after I win this competition.

34
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:24,601
When all of us were in
Untucked, it got crazy.

35
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,914
There's a lot
of unfinished business.

36
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:31,194
So Untucked, ladies,
was really eventful.

37
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,440
- Girl.
- Bitch, it's about to be

38
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:37,338
like an Atlanta strip club
up in here, bitch,

39
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:38,995
with bottles flying
and fists flying

40
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:40,307
and wigs everywhere, baby.

41
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:42,447
I think there's a difference
between being arrogant

42
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:43,631
and being confident
who the fuck you are.

43
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:45,346
There's a difference,
but you ain't...

44
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:47,728
You're not being confident,
you're being arrogant.

45
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:49,499
Girl, get the fuck out of
here with that bull shit.

46
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:50,455
That's not bull shit,
that's a fact.

47
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:51,604
You literally walked in here

48
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:53,158
and said, "I don't like
some of you girls

49
00:01:53,182 --> 00:01:54,982
because you arrogant
and got nasty attitudes."

50
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:57,186
I said what I said.

51
00:01:57,255 --> 00:01:59,464
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

52
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,982
Girl, star quality?

53
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,581
Bitches in here
is mother fucking trying me,

54
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:03,951
and I'm to pop the fuck off.

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,815
Cause you're going to
call me arrogant

56
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,714
what any of the bottom girls
have to say about me,

57
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,682
because I'm staying here safe.

58
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,477
Suck it, bitch.

59
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:14,962
Take me out right now!

60
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:21,555
How's everybody feeling
about that now?

61
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:22,625
I guess I felt defensive.

62
00:02:22,694 --> 00:02:23,705
I guess I was going
the fuck off.

63
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:25,075
I was mad, I was upset.

64
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,077
I thought we was cool,
and then out of nowhere

65
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,666
you don't like me,
which is, like, news to me.

66
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,324
I feel like it was blown
out of proportion.

67
00:02:32,393 --> 00:02:34,913
Tamisha is honest,
she is who she is,

68
00:02:34,982 --> 00:02:38,365
and if she has a problem with
someone, she's gonna tell them.

69
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,952
Whereas with Kandy,
she can dish it

70
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:41,989
but she has a difficult time
taking it,

71
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:43,991
and she gets very defensive.

72
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,063
She came in, was nasty,
and got what she deserved back.

73
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,893
I said y'all are doing amazing,

74
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,482
even though it's some girls
I don't care for.

75
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,656
That's what I said.

76
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,623
No, what you said was

77
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,107
I don't like some of you girls,

78
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,937
but you girls did good
in the ball challenge.

79
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:01,181
Because I've been doing drag
for just so long...

80
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,251
That's not what I said.

81
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,493
That's what you heard,

82
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:05,012
but that's not what I said.

83
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,990
I'm making shit up, girl.
Roll back the fucking tape.

84
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:08,326
That's literally what you said.

85
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:11,398
It's a couple of you girls
I really don't care for,

86
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,986
but I have to commend you
on your drag.

87
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:15,712
I'm one to give props
where props are due.

88
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,301
And I still say it's a couple of
girls in here I don't care for,

89
00:03:18,336 --> 00:03:20,786
because you have some really
nasty attitudes or whatever.

90
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,202
But that's just me personally.

91
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,241
She just said, "I don't care
for some of y'all,"

92
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,174
- but that was in...
- That's what I said.

93
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,796
That's what I said.

94
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:32,118
And then I said,
"Who are you talking about?"

95
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:34,051
- And then you said, "You."
- What you mean, bitch?

96
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:36,492
Don't ask a question
you don't want an answer to.

97
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,149
May I ask,
where did it come from?

98
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,219
What was that about?

99
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:43,326
Since we have entered
the werkroom

100
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:46,502
with the girls
that all eliminated us,

101
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,539
what I have seen and what
have been discussed...

102
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,034
Even if the other group that
was eliminated and came back

103
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:52,404
was talking about us,

104
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:55,925
whatever the other girls feel
some type of way about me,

105
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,075
two of them is already gone and
our entire group is still here.

106
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:01,206
That is what I'm talking about.

107
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:04,140
Kandy just showed me
point-blank, period

108
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,945
that you feel like
every member in the A team

109
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,074
is better than B team.

110
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:08,972
Last week, Kandy stood up

111
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,778
and said, "Symone
is my biggest competition,"

112
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:12,044
like we wasn't in the room.

113
00:04:12,113 --> 00:04:14,219
You're only gonna rank yourself
amongst your girls,

114
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,748
and that's the thing
that's disheartening,

115
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:19,500
because it's a competition
amongst all of us.

116
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:22,192
Like I said, we don't gotta
kiki, we don't gotta talk.

117
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,780
Girl, we don't even
gotta be sisters,

118
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:24,999
just we're in
the same competition.

119
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,207
Don't look my way,
I won't look your way.

120
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,381
Don't speak to me,
I won't speak to you.

121
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,337
I don't need you
to tell me that.

122
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,890
I'm a grown-ass woman.

123
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,374
You don't need to tell me that.

124
00:04:31,443 --> 00:04:33,997
But nevertheless,
what I said is what I said.

125
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,137
So with that being said,

126
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,322
I wanna get out of drag,
so let's end it.

127
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:39,382
Goodbye, good night.

128
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:41,660
- What's for dinner?
- What's for dinner?

129
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,662
Atlanta people
don't take no shit

130
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:45,837
and Brooklyn people
don't take no shit.

131
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,977
It's about to get real
interesting from here on out.

132
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,368
At the end of the day,
the pageant has started.

133
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:52,153
We gonna see the best man win.

134
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:53,234
At this moment,
Tamisha's dead to me.

135
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:54,190
I don't wanna hear about it.

136
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,641
All of my girls
that are rooting for me,

137
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,298
I love them to death.

138
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,679
For everyone else that has
something to say about me...

139
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:05,270
Kandy's cockiness is going
to bite her in the ass.

140
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,168
So just like you
in the winner's circle,

141
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,861
it's easy to get in
the loser's circle, so, heh.

142
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,969

Today is a new day,

154
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,243
and the mood in the werkroom
is hella awkward

155
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,695
because we fully had the bad
girls club brawl last week.

156
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,076
And I don't think
we ever really found,

157
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,666
like, a happy place
to go back to.

158
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:58,806
So can we just say, like,
it's a brand-new week

159
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,094
and we can just, like,
leave everything in the past

160
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:01,164
that we went through last week?

161
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:02,741
Absolutely.

162
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,880
Can we just start fresh?

163
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,675
I mean, wishful thinking.

164
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:08,057
I mean, wishful thinking.

165
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,301
Ooh, girl.

166
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,132
She done already
done had herses.

167
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,616
- Let's go, bitch.
- Let's go!

168
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,860
Hey, bad girls.

169
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:20,690
Whether you're hot stuff
or a superfreak,

170
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,658
if you wanna stay alive,

171
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:25,799
you betta shake
that groove thing, girl,

172
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:30,079
or this could be
your last dance.

173
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:32,426
Toot-toot, hey.

174
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:34,842
Oh, my God.

175
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,603
Hello, hello, hello!

176
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,330
- Hi!
- Come on, ascot!

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,092
I'm your host,
RuPaul Charles Nelson Reilly.

178
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:44,576
Oh!

179
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,854
Oh!

180
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,444
America's next drag superstar

181
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:52,342
must never fade
into the background,

182
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,828
so for today's mini-challenge,

183
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,312
you'll be working in pairs

184
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:59,349
to create eye-popping
designer dresses

185
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,769
using wallpaper
provided by Spoonflower.com.

186
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:08,220
Now, to prove your design
doesn't blend in,

187
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,568
one of you will be
modeling the dress

188
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:12,777
in front of a wall
of matching wallpaper.

189
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:19,162
And the other will provide
fashion commentary.

190
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,752
Now, I need you all to pair up,

191
00:07:22,821 --> 00:07:25,583
but choose carefully,
because whoever you choose

192
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:29,379
will be your partner
for both today's mini-challenge

193
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,555
and this week's maxi-challenge.

194
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,213
Now, Gottmik, you were
our winner last week,

195
00:07:35,282 --> 00:07:39,148
so you get to wait and join
the pair of your choice.

196
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,805
Oh, my.

197
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:42,496
Oh, oh, oh!

198
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:43,808
Oh! Oh! Oh!

199
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,154
Now, raise your hand.

200
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,052
Do you know who
Charles Nelson Reilly is?

201
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:50,262
No, no one. Okay.

202
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,609
Fuck all of you.

203
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,163
Okay, queens, pick a partner.

204
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:59,409
Oh. Olivia was first. Sorry.

205
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,860
Sure, yes.

206
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:05,381
So at the bottom of the barrel
is myself and Tamisha.

207
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,141
Same shit, different day.

208
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,905
All right, Gottmik,

209
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:15,495
which couple will you
be turning into a throuple?

210
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:18,290
Oh, I think I'm gonna go
with Kandy and Tina.

211
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:21,155
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

212
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,709
Oh, my God, drum roll.

213
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:23,951
Who is Mik gonna pick?

214
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,608
Oh, my God,
this is so nerve-wracking.

215
00:08:25,677 --> 00:08:27,137
Of course you're gonna
fucking pick me and Kandy.

216
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:28,542
Don't even try it, sis.

217
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,993
Okay, queens,
you have 30 minutes

218
00:08:31,062 --> 00:08:34,617
to create
your wallpaper dresses. Go!

219
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,897
Oh, we're sickening now.
Okay, good to know.

220
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,727
Okay, does this cover my hole?

221
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:41,969
Yep.

222
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,558
All right, time's up,
wallflowers.

223
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:49,287
First up, Tina Burner,
Kandy Muse, and Gottmik.

224
00:08:49,356 --> 00:08:52,670
From a drag queen
who likes it raw,

225
00:08:52,739 --> 00:08:54,257
everyone looks fishy

226
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,950
in this design we're calling
Catch of the Day.

227
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,711
You'll never blend
into the background.

228
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,267
You'll tuna roll all over it.

229
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,580
That last joke made me feel
a little eel.

230
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:07,926
Aah!

231
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:09,825
Up next, Rosé and Denali.

232
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:13,311
Here's Button Foster.

233
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,556
Zipper? I hardly flipper!

234
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,387
I like big buttons,
and I cannot lie.

235
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:23,493
Up next, Tamisha Iman
and Elliott With 2 Ts.

236
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,290
What's the matter,
Carole Baskin got your tongue?

237
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,672
- Did you say Carole Baskin?
- Carole Baskin.

238
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:31,950
Oh, that bitch. I hate her.

239
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,505
The Tiger King has nothing
on the House of Food Stamps.

240
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,853
This is the same dress
Carole Baskin wore

241
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:41,304
when she kidnapped
her husband... allegedly.

242
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,824
The one-of-a-kind dress

243
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:46,240
smells like
Joe's exotic bedroom.

244
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,657
This dress
is giving me jungle fever.

245
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:49,899
Rawr.

246
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:53,454
Up next, Olivia Lux and Utica.

247
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:57,424
Just in time for allergy season,
it's Utica Queen

248
00:09:57,493 --> 00:10:02,636
in our growing new dress design,
photosynethe-sis.

249
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,091
This bitch is crazy.

250
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,646
Bitch, where are you going?

251
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:15,580
Jesus, take the bouquet.

252
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:20,274
And finally, LaLa Ri and Symone.

253
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:23,346
Fresh from the oven,
here's LaLa Ri

254
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:27,040
in the perfect design
to fire up your pepperoni.

255
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:29,111
Oh, I can tell
she's a meat lover.

256
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,528
Easy, cheesy, peasy. Pizza girl!

257
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:33,805
Okay, I'll take a slice.

258
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:37,464
Oh!

259
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,466
Nice work, ladies,

260
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:43,125
but one team really
sheetrocked this shit.

261
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,648
Tamisha Iman and Elliott
With 2 Ts, con-drag-ulations.

262
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:53,963
You've each won
a $2,500 gift card

263
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:59,831
to spend on customized
home decor at Spoonflower.com.

264
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,868
Werk!

265
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:03,179
Bitch!

266
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:07,114
Okay, queens, now that
you're already partnered up,

267
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:10,808
it's time to hit
the dance floor.

268
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,775
For this week's maxi-challenge,

269
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:15,744
you'll be making
a dancing documentary

270
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:20,576
about the beat that defined
a generation of liberation.

271
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,509
I'm talking disco, baby.

272
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,618
Now, in the seventies,
disco was about freedom, divas,

273
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,793
and bringing
funky people together.

274
00:11:30,862 --> 00:11:32,070
Aow!

275
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,003
Kinda like Drag Race does today.

276
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:38,180
So to bring the world's first
disco-mentary to life,

277
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:40,285
you'll need to learn
choreography,

278
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,841
and more importantly,
embody the spirit of disco.

279
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,292
Now, each team will be covering
a different chapter.

280
00:11:47,361 --> 00:11:49,363
Tina, Kandy, and Gottmik,

281
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:51,987
you're covering
the birth of disco.

282
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:56,198
Elliott and Tamisha,
you've got disco and sex.

283
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,338
Oh!

284
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:01,582
Olivia Lux and Utica, Studio 54.

285
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,794
Denali and Rosé, disco fashion!

286
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:08,279
- Oh, cute.
- Ooh!

287
00:12:08,348 --> 00:12:11,869
LaLa Ri and Symone,
you've got disco sucks.

288
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:13,525
Okay.

289
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:15,493
You know how to suck, don't you?

290
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:17,978
- Sho' do.
- Oh, my.

291
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,291
Hey, are y'all ready
to boogie-oogie-oogie?

292
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,017
- Yes!
- Yes!

293
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:24,433
Racers, start your engines,

294
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:28,230
and may the best
dancing queen win.

295
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,441
Yay, dancing challenges!

296
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,236
This is what I do.

297
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:35,858
I feel very underestimated

298
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:37,180
in this competition
by the other girls,

299
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,828
but this is my moment

300
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:41,622
to let them know
who they dealing with.

301
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:44,004
Coming up...

302
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:45,626
I think I'm holding on
a bit too much.

303
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,215
I still feel like I haven't
let my guard fully down.

304
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:50,148
If you were closer to me,
I'd slap you.

305
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,468
Girl, come on, disco inferno.

306
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:02,471
I think, like, finger dancing.

307
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,611
This week's maxi-challenge
is a disco-mentary.

308
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:06,820
And then roll it.

309
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,202
I love disco, I love dancing.

310
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:11,963
It is my challenge to win.

311
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,389
So we gonna be telling
the story of disco

312
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:16,174
through dance, baby, yes.

313
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:17,866
This just feels like home.

314
00:13:17,935 --> 00:13:19,799
When I hear disco,
it just sends, like,

315
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:22,525
a little sensation through
my body, like, ooh, hah!

316
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,114
Baby, she make you wanna move.

317
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:30,188
Jeez, that hair actually
makes Tina look small.

318
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:39,819
Tina, your hair
finally makes you look small.

319
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:43,103
I mean, if I stand next
to LaLa, I'll be good.

320
00:13:43,132 --> 00:13:45,238
Huh?

321
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,378
♪ Ooh-ee, ooh-ee ♪

322
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:49,035
- Hi!
- Yay!

323
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:50,381
Who's got boogie fever?

324
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,728
- Yes!
- Boogie-woogie!

325
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:56,352
All right, Denali and Rosé,
come on down.

326
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,113
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:59,873
So what made you
gravitate together?

328
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,599
You know, we both come
from dancing,

329
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:02,703
choreography backgrounds,

330
00:14:02,772 --> 00:14:04,164
so we just really get
counts and music

331
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:05,085
and everything like that.

332
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:06,154
Right.

333
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,812
Not only can we show off
what we can do,

334
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,089
but we can really push it,

335
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:11,989
because she's at
a similar level to me.

336
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:14,854
So you all are representing
disco fashion.

337
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:15,923
Yes, we are.

338
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,890
I used to work on cruise ships,

339
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,547
and they would make us spotlight

340
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:20,007
and work on a lot
of the production shows.

341
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,457
And one of them was
Saturday Night Fever,

342
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:23,724
so I'm very versed
in Bee Gees and their music.

343
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,761
So you worked on a cruise ship.

344
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,256
There's no ice skating
on cruise ships.

345
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,453
There is, actually.

346
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:29,592
- Ice skating?
- Yeah.

347
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,524
Oh, you fully ice skated
on a cruise ship?

348
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:31,525
I did, yeah.

349
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,941
There were ice rinks,

350
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,711
and they would employ 10 skaters
from all around the world,

351
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,437
and we would do production shows
for the guests on board.

352
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,635
It was a lot of fun.

353
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,584
But the boat is rocking
while you're performing,

354
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,432
and it's hard to do a spin.

355
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:44,021
Yeah, we would spin,
we would jump, we did it all.

356
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,989
Wow. Now, Rosé, you came
very close last week

357
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,578
to actually winning.

358
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:52,270
How are you gonna make sure
that you win this week?

359
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,685
Fuckin' let go.

360
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:55,111
I think I'm holding on
a bit too much.

361
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:56,757
And I'm doing well.

362
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,725
I've been in the top
three weeks in a row now.

363
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:02,211
But, like, I still feel like I
haven't let my guard fully down

364
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,385
in front of you all.

365
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:04,949
You know, I think
you're absolutely right.

366
00:15:04,973 --> 00:15:06,329
- Yeah.
- Because there's a feeling

367
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,562
that you're saying
to the judges,

368
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:09,736
you ain't gonna get me.

369
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:10,886
You ain't gonna break me down.

370
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,051
And it's a strategy,

371
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,227
but it doesn't allow people
to fall in love with you.

372
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,953
You're clearly very talented,

373
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,644
but people fall in love

374
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,751
out of honesty
and vulnerability.

375
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,994
I can't make it perfect,

376
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,488
so I gotta stop trying
to make it perfect.

377
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,514
- Yeah, perfect is overrated.
- Yeah.

378
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,033
Perfect is actually
kind of boring.

379
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:33,070
- Yeah.
- When you are in a disco

380
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,623
and you've got the lights going

381
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,050
and you're dancing around and
you're connecting to that beat,

382
00:15:37,074 --> 00:15:39,490
something magical happens.

383
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,182
This is an opportunity for you
to just let it all hang out.

384
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,150
All right,
I can't wait to see you.

385
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,151
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you, Ru.

386
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,499
All right, Symone, LaLa Ri.

387
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:52,779
So, now, you all are
representing disco sucks.

388
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:54,160
- Disco sucks.
- Okay.

389
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,885
So what do you know about disco?

390
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,957
I don't know much about disco.

391
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:59,786
- Uh-huh.
- Of course, Sylvester.

392
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:01,098
What do you about Sylvester?

393
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,755
I think he was, like,
a gay pioneer.

394
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:05,136
And what do you know
about disco?

395
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:06,527
There's a lot
of movin' and groovin',

396
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,622
a lot of colors, big hair.

397
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:11,349
What do you know about
the disco sucks movement.

398
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,248
I have never heard of it
until today.

399
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:14,673
The disco sucks movement
happened in Chicago.

400
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:16,320
A deejay in Chicago

401
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,909
had everyone bring down
a pile of disco records

402
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,051
to this stadium and set
these disco records on fire.

403
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,053
- Really?
- Wait, I didn't know that.

404
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:29,850
It was this revolt that
signaled the "end" of disco,

405
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,991
- but disco never really ended.
- Right.

406
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,658
People, the powers that be,
they get scared

407
00:16:33,682 --> 00:16:38,411
by uncaged, unbridled passion,
which is what disco is about.

408
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,653
You know, with rock music,

409
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:40,976
you dance to rock music
like this.

410
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,829
Mm-hmm.

411
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,141
But you don't do this.

412
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,383
Right.

413
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,764
That is a revolution.

414
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,834
- Yes.
- Yeah.

415
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,595
And also, it's
associated with gay,

416
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,356
Black music, freedom,

417
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,116
and that scared a lot of people,

418
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:55,231
because they couldn't
control it.

419
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:59,328
So that is why
disco sucks happened,

420
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:01,434
and that's what
you are representing

421
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:03,160
in this disco-mentary.

422
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,370
And just for the record,
disco does not suck.

423
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,681
Okay.

424
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,682
All right, kids, can't wait
to see you out there.

425
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:09,994
All right.

426
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,929
All right, Gottmik,
Kandy Muse, and Tina Burner.

427
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,137
- Hello!
- Hi!

428
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,346
So who knows
anything about disco?

429
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:18,655
You know how the Pussycat Dolls

430
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:19,807
had that one music video,
Hush, Hush,

431
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:20,946
and then it goes into that...

432
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,765
I Will Survive? I will Survive?

433
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:23,973
That's, like what I know.

434
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,183
If you were closer to me,
I'd slap you.

435
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,429
This bit that you all are doing,

436
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:34,743
it has to do with the roots
of disco and New York City.

437
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:38,540
Every disco had people
from uptown, downtown,

438
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:42,371
gay, straight, Black,
white, Latin, men, women,

439
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,993
everybody was there together,

440
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,619
and it is such an expression
of love and soul and unity.

441
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:53,279
So, Tina, if I say name your
top three disco records,

442
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:54,487
what would they be?

443
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:57,386
Knock On Wood, Thelma Houston.

444
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:59,940
That's not Thelma Houston, but...

445
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,701
- Or, um...
- Amy Stewart.

446
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,185
- Amy Stewart.
- Yeah.

447
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:05,256
- Don't Leave Me This Way.
- Thelma Houston, yeah.

448
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,120
And I Will Survive, Diana Ross.

449
00:18:07,189 --> 00:18:08,846
Well, you know, she covered it.

450
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,572
- Yeah.
- It's Gloria Gaynor's song.

451
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:11,641
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

452
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:13,885
You got me good.
You got me real good.

453
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:16,854
Do you have three favorite
disco songs, Gottmik?

454
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:19,615
Hmm. Probably
somewhere in there.

455
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:23,309
But I think I might keep them
to myself for right now.

456
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:25,311
Kandy, what's the difference

457
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,658
between Diana Ross
and Donna Summer?

458
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,603
- Did you know the difference?
- No, definitely, yeah.

459
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:33,112
"No, definitely?"

460
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:35,114
No, no, like,
no as in, like, yes.

461
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,530
Like, no, definitely, yes.

462
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,014
Like, no, yeah. Like, yeah.

463
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:41,844
Uh-huh. That's definitely no.

464
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,123
Please, give a synopsis.

465
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:47,988
Okay.

466
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:51,889
I know the difference.

467
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:57,446
One has big, curly, bouncy hair,
you know, Mahogany.

468
00:18:59,586 --> 00:19:03,038
And the other one's dead.

469
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:06,904
So listen, I will see you
on the dance floor.

470
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,423
Yes, you will.

471
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:09,872
It's gonna be fabulous.

472
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,461
Oh, it's gonna be good.
This is gonna be good.

473
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,153
All right, ladies, gather round.

474
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,776
Gather round, queens.

475
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:19,882
Now, in a few minutes
you'll head to the main stage

476
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:24,818
to turn the beat around with
choreographer Miguel Zarate.

477
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,442
So good luck, my disco ducks,

478
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:30,065
and don't fuck it up.

479
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:36,347
I wanna be in the top this week.

480
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,247
After fucking up that first,
like, group challenge, girl,

481
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:40,696
I need to, crk-crk-crk-crk.

482
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,181
You'll be okay.

483
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,564
Do y'all think it's gonna be
judged on group or individual?

484
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,876
I'm not sure, because, bitch,

485
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:50,085
if there's, like,
some partnering bull shit

486
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,554
and then, like,
one person fucks up,

487
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,157
like, you know, who knows?

488
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,135
Imagine it's, like,
you'll be judged as partners,

489
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:56,654
and then your partner and you
are in the bottom

490
00:19:56,678 --> 00:19:58,345
and you have to lip sync
against your partner.

491
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,544
See, that could be what it is.

492
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,305
Uh-uh!

493
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:04,824
Don't tell that to the universe!

494
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:07,654
I can see a three-way lip sync,
and then double elimination.

495
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:09,794
Um, I'm in that group.

496
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:12,245
That's fucked up.

497
00:20:12,314 --> 00:20:13,429
This is a dancing challenge,

498
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,948
and I should have picked
a dancing queen.

499
00:20:14,972 --> 00:20:16,974
Had I known,
I wouldn't have chosen

500
00:20:17,043 --> 00:20:18,734
two bitches with two left feet.

501
00:20:18,803 --> 00:20:21,565
And now here I am. fuck my life.

502
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:24,808
Coming up...

503
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:27,916
And outside and up. Lay out.

504
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,815
Miss Utica and this
little piece of fabric, girl.

505
00:20:36,683 --> 00:20:37,822
Whoo!

506
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,796
Hi!

507
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,142
How are you guys?

508
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:48,937
- Hi!
- Hello!

509
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:50,456
It's time to learn choreography.

510
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:52,147
I wanna feel transported

511
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,874
when I move my body
to the disco beat.

512
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:57,670
Hi, ladies.
My name is Miguel Zarate,

513
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:00,569
and I'm here to teach you some
moves for the disco-mentary.

514
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:02,882
Don't take yourself
too seriously.

515
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,066
Disco's about
having a lot of fun,

516
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,678
and that's really
what I'm looking for.

517
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:07,473
So we should just get to it.

518
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,474
Let me start with the trio.

519
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,165
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

520
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,409
So you guys start it off.

521
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:14,756
It's the birth of disco,
so we're gonna start

522
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:17,586
with a little dance
called the Seat belt.

523
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:18,655
Sounds gorgeous.

524
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:21,763
One, two, three, four.

525
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,492
Right now, it looks
a little up and flighty.

526
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:28,908
It's gotta be down and dirtier
and a little grimier.

527
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:32,049
All together, from the top.
Hit and the top.

528
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:34,914
Hit and a boom
and a boom and a boom.

529
00:21:34,983 --> 00:21:38,573
Our mean girl trio,
they look cute.

530
00:21:38,642 --> 00:21:41,127
And I say that facetiously.

531
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:46,132
That's strong, woom,
strong, woom.

532
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,617
And a boom and a boom
and a boom and a boom.

533
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,758
Much better except for Mik.

534
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:55,659
Grrr.

535
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,144
Grrr.

536
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:01,768
Okay, your song is Disco Sucks.

537
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,046
It's about your pussy
being on fire,

538
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:07,360
serving it hot,
and not apologizing for it.

539
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:09,983
Shuffle low, shuffle low.

540
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:12,434
Shuffle high, shuffle high.

541
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:15,920
Okay, you're going hip,
and I'm going dick.

542
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,474
Let's work on that.

543
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,579
Let's just stay in place
and then go...

544
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,443
down, pop it up,

545
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:22,962
down, pop it up,

546
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:24,653
down, thrust it.

547
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,172
Don't hurt yourself, LaLa.

548
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,896
You're still competing
tomorrow, girl.

549
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,419
Ooh, hah!

550
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:36,596
Elliott With 2 Ts and Tamisha,
your category is sex.

551
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:37,849
- Yes.
- I want you to think hot,

552
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:40,566
- I want you to think heavy.
- Yes.

553
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,602
And I want you
to think hula-hoop.

554
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:44,190
Hula-hoop?

555
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,019
Yes.

556
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:48,194
I don't want
no damn hula-hoop-a!

557
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:51,162
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going, keep it going.

558
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:53,278
Thrust it forward, thrust it
forward, thrust it forward.

559
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:54,407
Wow, that's a lot.

560
00:22:54,476 --> 00:22:55,857
Sexy is cute,

561
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:59,378
but the hula-hoop part,
what the hell?

562
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:02,070
And-a push and-a push
and-a push. relax the face,

563
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,072
Have fun, aow.

564
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,763
Five, six, seven, eight.

565
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:10,699
Elliott's like, one, two,
three, four, five.

566
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:14,185
And I'm like, one, four...
No, wait a minute, one... five...

567
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:15,394
Okay.

568
00:23:15,463 --> 00:23:18,120
- You got it, babe.
- I hate it.

569
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm trying, but at the end of
the day, I have another problem.

570
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,335
It's not just the cancer.

571
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,787
I'm here with an ostomy bag
on my stomach.

572
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:34,274
It's an open wound,
and it limits my mobility.

573
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:36,311
I can't do the things
that I normally could do.

574
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,485
Here we go, one more time.

575
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:39,521
Five, six, seven, have fun.

576
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,660
Funk it up, funk it up.

577
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:42,282
Having the ostomy,

578
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:43,984
and I didn't even mention this
to the other contestants.

579
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:45,469
I haven't asked
for special treatment.

580
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:47,874
I'm gonna always try
to rise to the occasion

581
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:49,048
off of my abilities.

582
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:51,982
Yes, werk! That's nice!

583
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:53,846
You guys, that's awesome.

584
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:56,987
It's a lot, but, you know,
at the end of the day,

585
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,403
everybody know fame costs.

586
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:04,891
All right,
your theme is fashion.

587
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,688
You have the most dance-heavy
of the sections.

588
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:09,827
♪ Hey ♪

589
00:24:09,896 --> 00:24:11,829
You're gonna do pas de bourree,
pas de bourree.

590
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:14,073
Turn, out, step, touch.

591
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:17,904
Do you want that to fan,
or do you want it to break?

592
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,181
Not that, bitch.

593
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:22,495
- I'm open to either/or.
- Let's do fan.

594
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:24,946
Pas de bourree, pas de bourree
bring it in.

595
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,707
This is the strongest technical
team when it comes to dancing.

596
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:29,468
Me and Rosé, we're killing it.

597
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:31,342
I'm really hoping that
I can win this challenge.

598
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:33,023
Beautiful, ladies.
Thank you guys so much.

599
00:24:33,092 --> 00:24:34,372
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Miguel.

600
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:35,991
Great job, great job, great job.

601
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,684
Our choreography is definitely
the most challenging

602
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:39,961
out of all the girls.

603
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,689
My biggest concern
for this challenge is...

604
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:46,277
winning.

605
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:48,210
All right, we have
Olivia and Utica.

606
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,903
Studio 54, it's like
confetti in a can.

607
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,076
And what we're gonna do

608
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,847
is bring that confetti
to life using this flag.

609
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:54,872
Here we go.

610
00:24:54,941 --> 00:24:57,426
Go, one, two, three, four,

611
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,359
and five, six, seven, good.

612
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:02,673
And outside and up. Lay out.

613
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:05,469
Utica!

614
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:08,852
Olivia and Utica, I mean, one of
them is doing the choreo wrong,

615
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:12,338
and by the looks on Olivia's
face, it's not Olivia.

616
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,374
One, two, three, four,

617
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:16,618
and five, around. No chainé.

618
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:20,622
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

619
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:22,348
- And then out.
- Oh, my God.

620
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:28,734
Miss Utica and this...

621
00:25:28,803 --> 00:25:30,977
Yeah. Whoo!

622
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,533
Miss Utica and this little
piece of fabric, girl.

623
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:37,121
This little piece of fabric
is tearing her up.

624
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,192
Utica, get out of your head,

625
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,445
because your creativity
is amazing.

626
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,575
When you let
your creativity flow,

627
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,508
like, I can't stop
looking at you.

628
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:47,649
But the second you don't,
I don't wanna look at you.

629
00:25:47,718 --> 00:25:48,788
Ooh.

630
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:49,996
I'm telling myself,

631
00:25:50,065 --> 00:25:52,067
I can do this, I can do this,
I can do this.

632
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,276
I am a great dancer,
I am a great dancer.

633
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,519
Like, I can do this!

634
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:58,315
But Olivia is full-on
disco inferno

635
00:25:58,384 --> 00:25:59,395
happening in partnership-land.

636
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:01,560
So I have, like,
some big shoes to fill

637
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,009
if I'm gonna compete with her.

638
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,046
Let's go. Yeah!

639
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:10,361
Coming up...

640
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:12,225
I think so that
everyone looks at us

641
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:14,124
as, like, the loud bitches
in the room.

642
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:15,619
Mean girls on three.
One, two, three.

643
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:16,654
- Mean girls.
- Mean girls.

644
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:18,507
Oh, is that the clique?

645
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,371
Oh, is that the clique?

646
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,615
Move over, Dream Girls,
it's the Mean Girls.

647
00:26:35,145 --> 00:26:36,664
Today we are gonna be performing

648
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:40,012
our disco-ography
on the main stage.

649
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:44,499
And I'm gonna feel disco
right up into my tuck, honey.

650
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:48,814
How are we feeling?

651
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,263
Here's the thing.

652
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:51,586
Like, we just have
strong personalities,

653
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,541
so we have to show
the personality on the stage.

654
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,095
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

655
00:26:54,164 --> 00:26:55,614
I know that everyone looks at us

656
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:58,755
as, like, the loud bitches
in the room.

657
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:00,032
But, baby, can we deliver?

658
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:01,343
That's the real tea.

659
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,450
And I think we can.

660
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,865
Yeah, no, we're gonna kill this.

661
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,498
- We're gonna fucking slay it.
- Yes, hands in the middle.

662
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:08,454
All right.

663
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,421
Mean girls on three.
One, two, three.

664
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,940
- Mean girls.
- Mean girls.

665
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:13,286
Oh, is that the clique?

666
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:14,736
Oh, is that the clique?

667
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:17,325
Some people think we're bitches,
but guess what?

668
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:20,259
Drag queens are very loud,
outspoken.

669
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:21,743
We push buttons.

670
00:27:21,812 --> 00:27:23,538
You wanna call it mean,
call it mean.

671
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,920
Move over, Dream Girls,
it's the Mean Girls.

672
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:30,510
How do you feel, Olivia?

673
00:27:30,579 --> 00:27:32,029
I feel really good.

674
00:27:32,098 --> 00:27:33,904
Yeah, you was up there
twirling with that flag, and...

675
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,032
Right.

676
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,182
I always wanted
to be in the color guard,

677
00:27:36,206 --> 00:27:37,276
you know what I mean?

678
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,380
- Really?
- Yeah.

679
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,244
I mean, I was in marching band.

680
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:43,316
I played the piccolo, and
it was the smallest instrument

681
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:46,216
for the biggest kid
on the field.

682
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:48,528
I used to be almost 300 pounds.

683
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:50,358
- Really?
- Yeah.

684
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:54,569
I just remember kinda getting
teased about my weight.

685
00:27:54,638 --> 00:27:58,884
I was so insecure because
I was still in the closet.

686
00:27:58,953 --> 00:28:03,509
And I was battling
with, like, my identity,

687
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:06,167
and it just was, like, a lot.

688
00:28:06,236 --> 00:28:09,411
It just was a really dark time

689
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,242
that I felt like
I just couldn't be myself

690
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,692
and couldn't be a kid.

691
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:15,290
Like, going through
what we went through

692
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:18,179
and the rehearsals and stuff
just reminds me

693
00:28:18,248 --> 00:28:22,321
that I wasn't able to do
what I'm able to do now always.

694
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,013
You know, I remember
going to the amusement parks,

695
00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:27,402
and there was one time where
I got turned away from a ride.

696
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:29,397
- Oh, my God.
- I couldn't fit in the seat

697
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,123
to even secure myself, so...

698
00:28:31,192 --> 00:28:32,641
When did you lose weight?

699
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:37,198
In high school, my mom...
We went to the doctor,

700
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:41,581
and the doctor said, like,
the dreaded "O" word to my mom.

701
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,445
- Like, your son's obese.
- Obese?

702
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:47,449
And my mom was just, like, we
gotta do something about this.

703
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:49,900
And I was on, like,
strict diets,

704
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:52,178
and that's when I found,
like, theater and drama

705
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:55,837
and that kind of all ended up
turning into, like, drag.

706
00:28:55,906 --> 00:28:57,839
Yeah. Olivia Lux, darling.

707
00:28:57,908 --> 00:28:58,909
Olivia Lux.

708
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:00,324
It took a long time

709
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:04,570
for me to be confident
with my own body, myself,

710
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,745
and now I don't even
look at the scale.

711
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:10,818
As long as I feel amazing,
that's all that matters.

712
00:29:10,887 --> 00:29:15,650
I guess in a way, drag saved
my well-being and my health.

713
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:17,203
Drag is the new diet.

714
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:19,343
Right. Try it sometime.

715
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:23,209
You really have no idea
what people have gone through,

716
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:24,970
and when you learn about it,

717
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,905
it really shows why they are
that person that they are.

718
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,770
Her journey created who
she is today, and I love her.

719
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:37,948
I admire you a lot, Kandy,

720
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:40,157
because you are very much
yourself at all times.

721
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,814
And your personality
is so infectious.

722
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,127
And, like, the thing is
I know sometimes, like,

723
00:29:44,196 --> 00:29:45,093
it comes out
a little bit abrasive

724
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,405
and too loud to some people.

725
00:29:46,474 --> 00:29:48,510
Tell us about your favorite
fight you've ever had.

726
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:50,650
My favorite fight I've ever had?

727
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:54,344
Girl, the one with the battle
of my inner demons, baby.

728
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:57,105
Ooh, tell us about that.

729
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:58,866
Well, I mean, all my life

730
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:01,696
has just been, like, a battle
with just, like, myself.

731
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:03,325
My mother was, like,
in and out of jail,

732
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:05,769
and just, like, you know,
all I knew was the streets.

733
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,195
And on the streets,
you have to be, like,

734
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,635
you know, girl, hood-smart.

735
00:30:09,704 --> 00:30:10,854
I've always felt like
I've had to defend myself,

736
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:12,880
whether it was, like,
at a job or in school

737
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:14,882
or in a relationship,
whatever the case may be.

738
00:30:14,951 --> 00:30:16,607
If I was, like,
faced with an obstacle,

739
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:18,506
girl, I was gonna go ham.

740
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,404
Growing up,
everyone always told me,

741
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:21,820
like, "You're not good enough,

742
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:23,107
and you're not gonna
amount to anything."

743
00:30:23,131 --> 00:30:24,453
And, like, even, like,
last time on Untucked,

744
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:25,893
when I was, like, going off,

745
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,836
like, in that moment I felt like
I needed to defend myself.

746
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,551
And I try not to be that way.

747
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:32,900
When me and Tamisha
had that little debacle,

748
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:35,074
it felt like it was definitely
a setback for me,

749
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:38,181
because I've worked so hard
to not be that angry person.

750
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,045
It took me 10 steps back,

751
00:30:40,114 --> 00:30:44,014
because I haven't been like that
in a very long time.

752
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,636
Learning and growing every day.

753
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:47,604
Learning and growing
every day, diva.

754
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:53,334
You have lived, like,
five different lifetimes.

755
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:56,544
Okay. But, you know,
I look back on it often,

756
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:57,510
and I wouldn't trade it
for the world.

757
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,619
I grew up in the projects.

758
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,006
Did you really?
Oh, I didn't know that.

759
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,411
Yeah, I grew up in the projects.

760
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,826
We had members in the community

761
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,055
that tried to keep the kids
out of trouble and whatnot.

762
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:07,693
There was this one particular
lady named Ms. Kemp.

763
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:09,050
She started, like,
a little cheerleading group.

764
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:11,248
We didn't have no football team
or nothing like that,

765
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:12,974
but she gave the girls
something to do.

766
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:15,770
Dance, cheerleading,
whatever your talent is,

767
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,634
Ms. Kemp wanted
to bring it out of you.

768
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:19,612
I would always go to practice
with her and whatnot,

769
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:21,880
and my nickname was Booty.

770
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:22,949
- Booty?
- Booty.

771
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:23,916
I've seen it.

772
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:27,126
So she was like,
"Booty can flip."

773
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:29,439
When she figured out that
I could flip, I could split,

774
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:30,785
I could do all those things,

775
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:33,788
but no one had ever
allowed me to do it.

776
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:35,859
Mind you, I'm up there
just having fun,

777
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,550
not knowing
what the hell's going on.

778
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,035
My grandmother got wind

779
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:42,831
that I'm up here doing gay stuff
or whatever, whatever.

780
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,912
And she was like,
"No, boys don't do this

781
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:45,282
and boys don't do that."

782
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:47,595
Ms. Kemp was actually the one
who gave me my foundation

783
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:49,528
and let me know that
I was talented, you know?

784
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:51,461
I'm grateful for the lady
in my community

785
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,394
that took a chance on me.

786
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:55,706

Every once in a while,

988
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:22,367
someone will have
to double-take at me

989
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:24,956
and go, "Is that
a man or a woman?"

990
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:26,992
It is the complete
transformation,

991
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:28,649

One of my many creations.

998
00:42:47,944 --> 00:42:50,095

Uh-huh.

1007
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:08,700
She is working the micro-berkin.

1009
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,219
This is not your ordinary walk,

1010
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:12,243
ladies and gentlemen.

1011
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:14,039
This is a strut.

1012
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:18,768
I am giving you
supermodel vibes.

1013
00:43:18,837 --> 00:43:20,839
My little black dress
fits every curve of my body.

1014
00:43:20,908 --> 00:43:23,808
I feel beautiful.

1015
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:26,224
Bring back my curls.

1016
00:43:29,676 --> 00:43:32,920
Utica Queen. Who the queen?

1017
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,439
You the queen.

1018
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:36,948
So my little black dress
is inspired by Audrey Hepburn,

1019
00:43:36,993 --> 00:43:38,873
and these beautiful
little earrings that I have.

1020
00:43:38,926 --> 00:43:41,170
I wanted to become the earrings,

1021
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:43,034
so I have my earring
back on my hat,

1022
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:46,727
and I am strutting down
the runway in shades of gold.

1023
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:50,628
I'm definitely feeling like
my true, authentic self in art,

1024
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:53,251
and I'm really excited
about this concept.

1025
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,460
Her head says, "I'm a hooker."

1026
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:58,359
Denali.

1027
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:02,087
She's starring in
the Queef of the Spider Woman.

1028
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:06,540
My, what a tangled web we wear.

1029
00:44:06,609 --> 00:44:10,095
I am serving you Mommy Longlegs

1030
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:13,374
in my arachnid-inspired
little black widow dress.

1031
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:15,998
The back of my dress
has gorgeous beading.

1032
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:17,344
Call me Charlotte,

1033
00:44:17,413 --> 00:44:20,140
because I am spinning webs
and turning heads.

1034
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:23,108
I am widowed, but plot twist:

1035
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:25,455
I killed that mother fucker.

1036
00:44:25,524 --> 00:44:26,594
Oh.

1037
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,089
Michelle, her eyes are up there.

1038
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:31,323
Rosé.

1039
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:33,843
If you squeeze her dress,
her tulle pops out.

1040
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,478
Simply showing up
toRuPaul's Drag Race

1041
00:44:37,502 --> 00:44:39,400
with a little black dress
would be boring,

1042
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,955
so I've got this
beautiful grey tulle

1043
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:45,303
framing my truly
little black dress.

1044
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:47,926
This look is definitely
a little bit camp,

1045
00:44:47,995 --> 00:44:49,997
but it's also very sexy,

1046
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:51,346
and I feel like a million bucks,

1047
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:54,726
so I'm soaking up every minute
on this runway.

1048
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:57,418
Anyone else hungry
for a Hot Pocket?

1049
00:44:58,523 --> 00:45:00,249
LaLa Ri.

1050
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:02,527
Read my lips.

1051
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:08,429
Any time I'm given the chance

1052
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:11,432
to wear something small
and little and sexy,

1053
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,641
oh, bitch, sign me up.

1054
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,678
Showing a little
piece of ass for the class.

1055
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:18,439
Let me use everything I got
to get everything that I want.

1056
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,131
Let's go, little black dress.

1057
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,133
Little black tube top.

1058
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,836
If that dress were any shorter,

1059
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,932
they'd have to arrest you
for dealing crack.

1060
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:31,383
Whoo!

1061
00:45:31,452 --> 00:45:32,488
Symone.

1062
00:45:32,557 --> 00:45:34,041
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1063
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:36,526
Somebody's going
to Miss Charles' hair salon.

1064
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:42,084
I am giving you
Black hair is a revolution!

1065
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:45,501
And if you don't know where
that's from, let me tell you.

1066
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,642
This hair is a reference
to RuPaul's music video,

1067
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:50,748
Back To My Roots.

1068
00:45:50,817 --> 00:45:53,233
So this little black dress
is made of braiding hair,

1069
00:45:53,302 --> 00:45:54,406
and I am here to model.

1070
00:45:54,475 --> 00:45:56,684
Straight from the beauty shop.

1071
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,352
Michelle,
the hair show is in town.

1072
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:00,688
Honey, Miss Hair Show 1982.

1073
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,798
So good. Damn.

1074
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:08,386
♪ Bring back my girls ♪

1075
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,215
Coming up...

1076
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:12,148
You were a disco queen
to me tonight.

1077
00:46:12,217 --> 00:46:14,461
- You are radiant.
- It was a little bit off.

1078
00:46:20,536 --> 00:46:23,194
Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

1079
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,819
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1080
00:46:29,648 --> 00:46:32,237
Gottmik.

1081
00:46:32,306 --> 00:46:34,170
Denali.

1082
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,103
Rosé.

1083
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:38,761
LaLa Ri.

1084
00:46:41,143 --> 00:46:42,938
Symone.

1085
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:45,733
Queens...

1086
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,875
You are safe.

1087
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:53,811
You may leave the stage.

1088
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:01,853
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1089
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:04,442
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques...

1090
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,756
Starting with Tina Burner.

1091
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,105
This look, you obviously
give us a big dash of camp,

1092
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:13,485
and I love that.

1093
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:17,351
I would like the hair bigger
to balance everything out.

1094
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,077
It squashes you.
It should lift you up.

1095
00:47:19,146 --> 00:47:20,423
Yeah.

1096
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:23,841
Your performance, though,
was out of this world.

1097
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,568
I love that homage-
to-Bob-Mackie beaded number.

1098
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:29,432
I think that beaded short dress,

1099
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:32,263
with all that movement,
was really fantastic.

1100
00:47:32,332 --> 00:47:33,712
You took control of the stage,

1101
00:47:33,781 --> 00:47:36,681
and you were a disco queen
to me tonight.

1102
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,785
Well done.

1103
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,477
Thank you very much.

1104
00:47:39,546 --> 00:47:41,928
Up next, Kandy Muse.

1105
00:47:41,997 --> 00:47:44,033
This look, I think
it's really fun.

1106
00:47:44,102 --> 00:47:45,483
I like the ode to fashion,

1107
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:49,349
but I do find the hair and some
of the paint details on the face

1108
00:47:49,418 --> 00:47:51,938
are a little distracting
and a little messy.

1109
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:53,950
I do wanna say about your outfit
in the disco thing, too,

1110
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:58,013
it was a little too plain
for RuPaul's Drag Race.

1111
00:47:58,082 --> 00:48:01,982
In your performance,
you are from the boogie-down,

1112
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:02,983
you're from
the south South Bronx,

1113
00:48:03,052 --> 00:48:04,191
and you keep it real,

1114
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,548
so we get a lot of talk
to the hand

1115
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:06,849
and a lot of...

1116
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,713
I love that about you.

1117
00:48:08,782 --> 00:48:10,415
The one comment that I'm
gonna say about them, though,

1118
00:48:10,439 --> 00:48:12,613
is it's always the same,

1119
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:13,614
and it kind of
doesn't go anywhere.

1120
00:48:13,683 --> 00:48:15,893
Sometimes
when we're big and bold,

1121
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:18,896
we think we gotta be
"Whoo, chile, lawd have mercy."

1122
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,277
You don't have to be that
all the time.

1123
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:24,625
So it's a matter of giving us
other sides of Kandy Muse,

1124
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:27,456
so we can see that
you've got more than that.

1125
00:48:27,525 --> 00:48:29,251
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1126
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,840
Up next, Elliott With 2 Ts
for your pleasure.

1127
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:37,569
I love the little black dress,
but it's too... regular.

1128
00:48:37,638 --> 00:48:38,743
Okay.

1129
00:48:38,812 --> 00:48:41,884
And then in the challenge,
you can move.

1130
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,886
- Thank you.
- You killed that shit.

1131
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,613
You looked like
you could have been Halston

1132
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:48,339
or Norma Kamali's muse.

1133
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:50,858
I wish I would have
gone to Studio 54

1134
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,648
when I was 10 years old
with Drew Barrymore,

1135
00:48:52,688 --> 00:48:54,966
but, alas, that wasn't
in the cards for me.

1136
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:57,658
But you gave us that experience.

1137
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:58,936
It was lit-lit.

1138
00:48:59,005 --> 00:49:01,593
Elliott, I know
you're a trained dancer.

1139
00:49:01,662 --> 00:49:04,769
What was it that attracted you
to dance in the first place?

1140
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:08,462
I always, as a little kid, would
spin around in the living room,

1141
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:09,705
and so my mom saw it,

1142
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:13,019
and at five years old
put me in dance class.

1143
00:49:13,088 --> 00:49:15,849
It was my escape from
the bullying and the torment

1144
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:18,541
that I received
in that small farm town.

1145
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,612
It healed me, it protected me.

1146
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:23,201
I've said this before
and I'll say it again.

1147
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:26,825
If you have a child,
put your child in dance class!

1148
00:49:26,894 --> 00:49:29,311
Yes!

1149
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,245
Up next, Tamisha Iman.

1150
00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:33,487
This outfit, for me,

1151
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:35,765
I'm always looking
for that twist.

1152
00:49:35,834 --> 00:49:37,975
- It's a really gorgeous garment.
- Thank you.

1153
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:39,331
Just think about
always elevating it.

1154
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:41,668
- Is that neoprene?
- It is.

1155
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:43,118
It's not easy to work with that.

1156
00:49:43,187 --> 00:49:45,406
But I think what's happening
a little bit with the pleating

1157
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,545
is it's so much gathering up top

1158
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,813
that it kind of
takes away from your figure.

1159
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:52,748
In the challenge,
it was a little bit off.

1160
00:49:52,817 --> 00:49:55,268
You're kind of thinking
about what's coming next.

1161
00:49:55,337 --> 00:49:58,443
I think if you just have
a little more fun and exhale,

1162
00:49:58,512 --> 00:50:01,032
I think you're gonna perform
better and also enjoy it more.

1163
00:50:01,101 --> 00:50:02,482
Like with anal sex.

1164
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:05,692
Exactly. Exactly.

1165
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:08,833
I'm still getting a little bit
of fear in your eyes

1166
00:50:08,902 --> 00:50:10,904
when you're performing.

1167
00:50:10,973 --> 00:50:12,123
Six months ago, I couldn't walk.

1168
00:50:12,147 --> 00:50:14,287
I'm trying to get back
to the old Tamisha.

1169
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:15,874
So I'm fighting,
but at the same time,

1170
00:50:15,943 --> 00:50:17,186
like you said, I'm in my head.

1171
00:50:17,255 --> 00:50:20,051
And I'm not making excuses.
I'm just being honest.

1172
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,329
- Thank you, Tamisha.
- Thank you.

1173
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:28,059
Up next, a disco queen,
child, Miss Olivia Lux.

1174
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,129
Tonight on the runway,

1175
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:31,994
I think the hair
is what's speaking here,

1176
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,099
and we are listening.

1177
00:50:33,168 --> 00:50:35,446
And then you gave us
a little twist

1178
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:37,310
with the micro-berkin I call it.

1179
00:50:39,105 --> 00:50:40,934
I had a good time watching you.

1180
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:43,454
I thought I was back
in the disco days.

1181
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:44,869
It just... everything worked.

1182
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:47,872
Your disco hair was the first
thing that caught my eye.

1183
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,667
That is your hair.

1184
00:50:49,736 --> 00:50:50,885
That's, like, your trademark,

1185
00:50:50,909 --> 00:50:53,360
and it was so gorgeous
the way it moved.

1186
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:55,362
It was just amazing.

1187
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:58,089
You exude positivity and joy,

1188
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:01,299
that disco vibe that
was so happy about that time.

1189
00:51:01,368 --> 00:51:03,336
I think you have
what they call "It factor."

1190
00:51:03,405 --> 00:51:05,303
I mean, it's just
you are radiant.

1191
00:51:05,372 --> 00:51:07,167
Thank you.

1192
00:51:07,236 --> 00:51:09,549
Up next, Utica Queen.

1193
00:51:09,618 --> 00:51:10,998
Tonight in the challenge,

1194
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,036
I felt like I was watching
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman

1195
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,037
meets Carol Burnett.

1196
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,695
There were so many faces
being made,

1197
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,835
I felt like I wasn't in a disco.

1198
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:22,562
Camp is great,
but there is a line

1199
00:51:22,631 --> 00:51:26,428
where it becomes caricature
of a caricature.

1200
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:28,085
Tonight on the runway,

1201
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:31,088
I wanna know how you
came up with this look.

1202
00:51:31,157 --> 00:51:32,813
I'm my earrings.

1203
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,298
Your earrings?

1204
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:36,783
Yeah, yeah, I'm my earrings.

1205
00:51:36,852 --> 00:51:39,924
And then the thing
on top is the earring!

1206
00:51:39,993 --> 00:51:41,822
- Oh, my God, you guys!
- Get it?

1207
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,376
Thank you
for explaining this look,

1208
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:44,377
because before, I was like,

1209
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:46,827
what the fuck is going on here.

1210
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,083
I mean, I loved it.
I just didn't know what it was.

1211
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:52,316
Sometimes you have to think
to yourself, you know,

1212
00:51:52,385 --> 00:51:53,845
are they really
gonna understand this?

1213
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,664
Because it's a competition.

1214
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:58,632
Put you, but make sure
that they can understand it.

1215
00:52:00,047 --> 00:52:02,878
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1216
00:52:02,947 --> 00:52:05,570
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1217
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:08,090
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1218
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:13,095
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

1219
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:14,234
whaddaya think?

1220
00:52:14,303 --> 00:52:16,236
Tina Burner.

1221
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:17,938
When she came out
during that performance,

1222
00:52:17,962 --> 00:52:21,138
the other two, I forgot them,
and I was looking at Tina.

1223
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:22,449
She's a real showgirl.

1224
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:24,244
That dress was fantastic.

1225
00:52:24,313 --> 00:52:26,902
Gangbusters when she came out
on that stage.

1226
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:28,628
Kandy Muse.

1227
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:31,113
I feel like her content needs
to catch up to her personality,

1228
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,287
if that makes sense.

1229
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:34,392
I want her
to go above and beyond

1230
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:36,187
what comes naturally for her.

1231
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:38,879
I want her to push herself
out of her comfort zone.

1232
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:40,018
It would have been funny

1233
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:41,479
if she played
almost like a dumb blonde,

1234
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:42,573
which is total opposite,

1235
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:44,057
and it could have been
really fun

1236
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:45,990
and we wouldn't have
taken our eyes off of her.

1237
00:52:46,059 --> 00:52:50,891
Kandy Muse did not capture
the spirit of the disco-mentary.

1238
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,721
Elliott With 2 Ts.

1239
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,275
Elliott could dance,
and she let us have it tonight.

1240
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:59,176
And she sold the story
with her body movement.

1241
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:00,418
As good as the disco was,

1242
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:02,938
the runway
was kind of disappointing.

1243
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:05,078
It was Sex in the City.
I love it.

1244
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:06,562
If the city were Albuquerque.

1245
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,325
Oh, my goodness.

1246
00:53:10,394 --> 00:53:11,498
Tamisha.

1247
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:12,810
She has the chops

1248
00:53:12,879 --> 00:53:15,157
to be competing with every one
of these girls up here.

1249
00:53:15,226 --> 00:53:17,573
Timing was off, props were off.

1250
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:20,300
We have to critique her
on what we saw.

1251
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:24,062
In this challenge she was timid,

1252
00:53:24,131 --> 00:53:28,135
and you could see in her eyes
that she was unsure of herself.

1253
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:32,864
The pros for Tamisha
is that she is a survivor.

1254
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:37,248
It's a tough one, because she's
still finding her sea legs.

1255
00:53:37,317 --> 00:53:41,977
Do we judge her like anyone else
who enters this competition?

1256
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,462
Olivia Lux.

1257
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:46,533
Olivia's like
Michelle Visage: easy.

1258
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:47,810
Yes!

1259
00:53:47,879 --> 00:53:49,743
Everything is easy for her.

1260
00:53:49,812 --> 00:53:51,676
I was just, like, looking at her

1261
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:54,576
and enjoying the radiance

1262
00:53:54,645 --> 00:53:57,234
and the good energy
that is Olivia Lux.

1263
00:53:57,303 --> 00:53:59,028
You couldn't take
your eyes off of her

1264
00:53:59,097 --> 00:54:03,723
because she is a frickin' star.

1265
00:54:03,792 --> 00:54:07,727
There's a warm feeling
that she projects on stage

1266
00:54:07,796 --> 00:54:09,763
that you can't buy that.

1267
00:54:09,832 --> 00:54:11,524
Utica Queen.

1268
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:12,835
We shouldn't have had to dig

1269
00:54:12,904 --> 00:54:15,459
and ask to know that
it was a two-inch-long earring

1270
00:54:15,528 --> 00:54:18,634
that none of us would have
ever been able to see.

1271
00:54:18,703 --> 00:54:19,853
- Drag is a visual medium.
- Yeah.

1272
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:21,465
We need to see it
and get the joke.

1273
00:54:21,534 --> 00:54:25,192
I love the kind of queen she is,
but when she was performing,

1274
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,609
she does this thing
with her body

1275
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:30,577
that she's almost making
a joke out of everything

1276
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:34,754
in a way that is distracting
from the piece.

1277
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:37,170
She would not
have gotten in Studio 54

1278
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:39,068
with that outfit
that she had on.

1279
00:54:39,137 --> 00:54:40,391
She would have been
on the ropes.

1280
00:54:40,415 --> 00:54:42,969
Crimped, long hair,
yes, that was a seventies thing.

1281
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:44,350
But when you pull it back

1282
00:54:44,419 --> 00:54:47,491
into, like, you know,
an Eleanor Roosevelt low pony,

1283
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,838
it's not hot. Sorry.

1284
00:54:52,806 --> 00:54:56,051
Silence! Enough is enough.

1285
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,880
Bring back my girls.

1286
00:54:57,949 --> 00:54:59,779
Where they at?

1287
00:54:59,848 --> 00:55:00,952
Get 'em back.

1288
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:09,996
Welcome back, ladies.

1289
00:55:10,065 --> 00:55:11,929
I've made some decisions.

1290
00:55:14,276 --> 00:55:16,140
Tina Burner,

1291
00:55:16,209 --> 00:55:18,970
That's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh, we like it.

1292
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:22,802
You're safe.

1293
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:24,286
You may join the other girls.

1294
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:29,602
Olivia Lux.

1295
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:33,571
This week, you gave us
a sweet love hangover,

1296
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,884
and I don't want no cure.

1297
00:55:35,953 --> 00:55:37,679
Okay.

1298
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:40,544
Con-drag-ulations, You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

1299
00:55:43,236 --> 00:55:47,033
You've won a cash tip of $5,000.

1300
00:55:47,102 --> 00:55:48,034
I won?

1301
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:50,416
I won my first challenge.

1302
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:54,074
And it feels so amazing.

1303
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:56,076
You're finally seeing me.

1304
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:58,182
I am a force
to be reckoned with.

1305
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:05,500
Elliott With 2 Ts, you're safe.

1306
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:06,742
Thank you so much.

1307
00:56:09,883 --> 00:56:11,160
Tamisha Iman.

1308
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:14,750
This week, you looked
a little panicked at the disco.

1309
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:17,201
Kandy Muse.

1310
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:19,548
You gave us earth and wind,

1311
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:21,067
but we needed fire.

1312
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:24,829
Utica Queen.
The judges wanted you

1313
00:56:24,898 --> 00:56:27,314
to feel more mighty real.

1314
00:56:30,904 --> 00:56:34,080
Syracuse, Schenectady, Utica...

1315
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:36,358
You're safe.

1316
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:38,981
Thank you.

1317
00:56:43,986 --> 00:56:47,058
Kandy Muse, Tamisha Iman,

1318
00:56:47,127 --> 00:56:51,166
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1319
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:54,997
Kandy and Tamisha
literally just fought it out,

1320
00:56:55,066 --> 00:56:57,379
and now they're in
the bottom two together.

1321
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:59,830
Kandy cannot go home right now,

1322
00:56:59,899 --> 00:57:02,626
so she better slay this shit.

1323
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:04,351
Two queens stand before me.

1324
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,665
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1325
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:11,807
and save yourself
from elimination.

1326
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:15,535
The time has come...

1327
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:18,504
for you to lip sync...

1328
00:57:18,573 --> 00:57:21,368
for your life.

1329
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:27,098

Kandy Muse, shantay you stay.

1376
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:47,376
Thank you so much.

1377
00:59:48,412 --> 00:59:49,620
You may join the other girls.

1378
00:59:53,003 --> 00:59:54,832
Tamisha Iman.

1379
00:59:54,901 --> 00:59:59,457
You're a fighter,
a survivor, and a star.

1380
00:59:59,526 --> 01:00:03,047
Thank you for
the amazing opportunity.

1381
01:00:03,116 --> 01:00:04,186
I'm truly grateful.

1382
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:06,395
Thank you to each
and every one of you

1383
01:00:06,464 --> 01:00:08,777
from the bottom of my heart.

1384
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:10,227
Thank you.

1385
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:12,643
I never can say goodbye,

1386
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:17,890
so until we meet again,
I'll just say sashay away.

1387
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,893
Tamisha!

1388
01:00:20,962 --> 01:00:22,377
Tamisha!

1389
01:00:24,828 --> 01:00:25,898
Come here, babe.

1390
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,313
Kill it.

1391
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:29,971
No tea, no tea, no deal,
no deal, no deal, no deal.

1392
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,180
Do what you do.
I'll see you on the road.

1393
01:00:33,837 --> 01:00:35,677
It's not the end.
It's just till we meet again.

1394
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:41,258
I don't want anybody to feel sad
that Tamisha's going home.

1395
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:42,984
I was so worried about

1396
01:00:43,053 --> 01:00:44,986
are they gonna find out
that I got an ostomy?

1397
01:00:45,055 --> 01:00:46,297
Is it gonna hold me back?

1398
01:00:46,366 --> 01:00:48,368
Every competition,
you don't have to win.

1399
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:49,853
Sometimes you just
have to show up,

1400
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:52,372
and this is part of my legacy.

1401
01:00:52,441 --> 01:00:54,581
This gave me the drive,
determination that I needed

1402
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,722
to return back
to the art form that I love.

1403
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,103
Going home is not a bad thing,
because I can go home

1404
01:00:59,172 --> 01:01:01,036
and actually heal
to get ready for All Stars.

1405
01:01:02,797 --> 01:01:04,384
And I'm gonna
start working tomorrow,

1406
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,663
so whenever the call come,
I'm ready.

1407
01:01:10,528 --> 01:01:12,358
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1408
01:01:12,427 --> 01:01:15,292
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1409
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:17,294
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1410
01:01:17,363 --> 01:01:18,605
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1411
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,952
- Amen!
- Amen!

1412
01:01:20,021 --> 01:01:22,092

You need to improv for your life

1419
01:01:37,383 --> 01:01:41,559
on the trashy talk show
Bossy Rossy After Dark.

1420
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:43,803
No, I will not!

1421
01:01:43,872 --> 01:01:46,426
Woman, get your ass
out of my face!

You gave us over-the-top,
stupid and ridiculous.

Listen, you got to go hard
or go home.

1429
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:05,963
