1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,946
Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,748
We're having a bag ball.

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,150
Joey Jay.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,918
I can tell by looking at this

5
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,386
you're not the sewer.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,955
LaLa Ri.

7
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,591
It's some bags that
were glued onto a bodysuit.

8
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:15,892
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

9
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,026
Utica.

10
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,529
You have continuously
upped the fashion,

11
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,897
and I think tonight
was no exception.

12
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,765
Gottmik.

13
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,500
You have a really good
taste level

14
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,036
that transcended
all three of the looks.

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,472
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

16
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,374
Oh, my God.

17
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,300
LaLa Ri, shantay you stay.

18
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,237
Joey Jay, sashay away.

19
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,957
- Whew!
- My Lord.

20
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,959
That was a long runway.

21
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,262
Category is our clothes.

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,264
What a day.

23
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:59,068
My boyfriend-to-be
was just sent home, Joey Jay.

24
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,803
I'm so sad!

25
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:04,007
"I'm a gay-ass bitch. I'm who?

26
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,175
- Joey Jay."
- Joey Jay."

27
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,510
So, LaLa, I'm not
gonna come for you,

28
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,379
but you sent my man home.

29
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,381
Listen, bitch, Joey's cute,

30
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,182
and I definitely have
a big-ass crush on him,

31
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,517
and I most for sure

32
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:16,586
will sleep with the bitch
when we meet again

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,820
after I win this competition.

34
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,695
When all of us were in
Untucked, it got crazy.

35
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,997
There's a lot
of unfinished business.

36
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,292
So Untucked, ladies,
was really eventful.

37
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,539
- Girl.
- Bitch, it's about to be

38
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,441
like an Atlanta strip club
up in here, bitch,

39
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,109
with bottles flying
and fists flying

40
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,411
and wigs everywhere, baby.

41
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,546
I think there's a difference
between being arrogant

42
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,681
and being confident
who the fuck you are.

43
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,449
There's a difference,
but you ain't...

44
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,818
You're not being confident,
you're being arrogant.

45
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,553
Girl, get the fuck out of
here with that bullshit.

46
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,554
That's not bullshit
that's a fact.

47
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,655
You literally walked in here

48
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,223
and said, "I don't like
some of you girls

49
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,125
because you arrogant
and got nasty attitudes."

50
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,294
I said what I said.

51
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,596
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

52
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,031
Girl, star quality?

53
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,599
Bitches in here
is motherfucking trying me,

54
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,034
and I'm to pop the fuck off.

55
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,869
I don't give a fuck

56
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,772
what any of the bottom girls
have to say about me,

57
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,774
because I'm staying here safe.

58
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,543
Suck it, bitch.

59
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:16,003
Take me out right now!

60
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:22,618
How's everybody feeling
about that now?

61
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,686
I guess I felt defensive.

62
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,754
I guess I was going
the fuck off.

63
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,122
I was mad, I was upset.

64
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,124
I thought we was cool,
and then out of nowhere

65
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,727
you don't like me,
which is, like, news to me.

66
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,429
I feel like it was blown
out of proportion.

67
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,999
Tamisha is honest,
she is who she is,

68
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:39,469
and if she has a problem with
someone, she's gonna tell them.

69
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,037
Whereas with Kandy,
she can dish it

70
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,106
but she has a difficult time
taking it,

71
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,074
and she gets very defensive.

72
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:48,177
She came in, was nasty,
and got what she deserved back.

73
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,980
I said y'all are doing amazing,

74
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,583
even though it's some girls
I don't care for.

75
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,784
That's what I said.

76
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,719
No, what you said was

77
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,187
I don't like some of you girls,

78
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,023
but you girls did good
in the ball challenge.

79
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:02,225
Because I've been doing drag
for just so long...

80
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,292
That's not what I said.

81
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,527
That's what you heard,

82
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,029
but that's not what I said.

83
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,031
I'm making fuck up, girl.
Roll back the fuck tape.

84
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,399
That's literally what you said.

85
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,468
It's a couple of you girls
I really don't care for,

86
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,038
but I have to commend you
on your drag.

87
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,773
I'm one to give props
where props are due.

88
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,308
And I still say it's a couple of
girls in here I don't care for,

89
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,844
because you have some really
nasty attitudes or whatever.

90
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,236
But that's just me personally.

91
00:03:25,172 --> 00:03:28,317
She just said, "I don't care
for some of y'all,"

92
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,253
- but that was in...
- That's what I said.

93
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,854
That's what I said.

94
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,122
And then I said,
"Who are you talking about?"

95
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,058
- And then you said, "You."
- What you mean, bitch?

96
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't ask a question
you don't want an answer to.

97
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,229
May I ask,
where did it come from?

98
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,264
What was that about?

99
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,434
Since we have entered
the werkroom

100
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,603
with the girls
that all eliminated us,

101
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:50,640
what I have seen and what
have been discussed...

102
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:52,108
Even if the other group that
was eliminated and came back

103
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,509
was talking about us,

104
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,013
whatever the other girls feel
some type of way about me,

105
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,148
two of them is already gone and
our entire group is still here.

106
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,251
That is what I'm talking about.

107
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,154
Kandy just showed me
point-blank, period

108
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,956
that you feel like
every member in the A team

109
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,124
is better than B team.

110
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,992
Last week, Kandy stood up

111
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,761
and said, "Symone
is my biggest competition,"

112
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,062
like we wasn't in the room.

113
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,264
You're only gonna rank yourself
amongst your girls,

114
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,732
and that's the thing
that's disheartening,

115
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,570
because it's a competition
amongst all of us.

116
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,272
Like I said, we don't gotta
kiki, we don't gotta talk.

117
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,841
Girl, we don't even
gotta be sisters,

118
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,008
just we're in
the same competition.

119
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,243
Don't look my way,
I won't look your way.

120
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,411
Don't speak to me,
I won't speak to you.

121
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,412
I don't need you
to tell me that.

122
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,980
I'm a grown-ass woman.

123
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,448
You don't need to tell me that.

124
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,084
But nevertheless,
what I said is what I said.

125
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,220
So with that being said,

126
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:38,354
I wanna get out of drag,
so let's end it.

127
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,456
Goodbye, good night.

128
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,725
- What's for dinner?
- What's for dinner?

129
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,727
Atlanta people
don't take no shit

130
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,896
and Brooklyn people
don't take no shit.

131
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,031
It's about to get real
interesting from here on out.

132
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:50,399
At the end of the day,
the pageant has started.

133
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,236
We gonna see the best man win.

134
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,270
At this moment,
Tamisha's dead to me.

135
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,304
I don't wanna hear about it.

136
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,740
All of my girls
that are rooting for me,

137
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,375
I love them to death.

138
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,701
For everyone else that has
something to say about me...

139
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,315
Kandy's cockiness is going
to bite her in the ass.

140
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,184
So just like you
in the winner's circle,

141
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,877
it's easy to get in
the loser's circle, so, heh.

142
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:16,025

Today is a new day,

154
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,324
and the mood in the werkroom
is hella awkward

155
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,794
because we fully had the bad
girls club brawl last week.

156
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:54,163
And I don't think
we ever really found,

157
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,767
like, a happy place
to go back to.

158
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,902
So can we just say, like,
it's a brand-new week

159
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,170
and we can just, like,
leave everything in the past

160
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,171
that we went through last week?

161
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,773
Absolutely.

162
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,941
Can we just start fresh?

163
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,742
I mean, wishful thinking.

164
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,145
I mean, wishful thinking.

165
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,381
Ooh, girl.

166
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,218
She done already
done had herses.

167
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,686
- Let's go, bitch.
- Let's go!

168
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,921
Hey, bad girls.

169
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,757
Whether you're hot stuff
or a superfreak,

170
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,726
if you wanna stay alive,

171
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,862
you betta shake
that groove thing, girl,

172
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:31,167
or this could be
your last dance.

173
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,502
Toot-toot, hey.

174
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,938
Oh, my God.

175
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,673
Hello, hello, hello!

176
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,377
- Hi!
- Come on, ascot!

177
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,180
I'm your host,
RuPaul Charles Nelson Reilly.

178
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,715
Oh!

179
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,984
Oh!

180
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,554
America's next drag superstar

181
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,456
must never fade
into the background,

182
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,925
so for today's mini-challenge,

183
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,426
you'll be working in pairs

184
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,463
to create eye-popping
designer dresses

185
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:05,801
using wallpaper
provided by Spoonflower.com.

186
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,238
Now, to prove your design
doesn't blend in,

187
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,607
one of you will be
modeling the dress

188
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,843
in front of a wall
of matching wallpaper.

189
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:20,216
And the other will provide
fashion commentary.

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,819
Now, I need you all to pair up,

191
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,656
but choose carefully,
because whoever you choose

192
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,459
will be your partner
for both today's mini-challenge

193
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,629
and this week's maxi-challenge.

194
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,265
Now, Gottmik, you were
our winner last week,

195
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,236
so you get to wait and join
the pair of your choice.

196
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,904
Oh, my.

197
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,572
Oh, oh, oh!

198
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,874
Oh! Oh! Oh!

199
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,208
Now, raise your hand.

200
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,101
Do you know who
Charles Nelson Reilly is?

201
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,347
No, no one. Okay.

202
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,682
Fuck all of you.

203
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,241
Okay, queens, pick a partner.

204
00:07:56,409 --> 00:08:00,523
Oh. Olivia was first. Sorry.

205
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,892
Sure, yes.

206
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:06,429
So at the bottom of the barrel
is myself and Tamisha.

207
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,154
Same shit, different day.

208
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,935
All right, Gottmik,

209
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,539
which couple will you
be turning into a throuple?

210
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,342
Oh, I think I'm gonna go
with Kandy and Tina.

211
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:22,211
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

212
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,746
Oh, my God, drum roll.

213
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,980
Who is Mik gonna pick?

214
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,649
Oh, my God,
this is so nerve-wracking.

215
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,184
Of course you're gonna
fucking pick me and Kandy.

216
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,618
Don't even try it, sis.

217
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,054
Okay, queens,
you have 30 minutes

218
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,682
to create
your wallpaper dresses. Go!

219
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,962
Oh, we're sickening now.
Okay, good to know.

220
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,831
Okay, does this cover my hole?

221
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,032
Yep.

222
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,625
All right, time's up,
wallflowers.

223
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:50,373
First up, Tina Burner,
Kandy Muse, and Gottmik.

224
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,743
From a drag queen
who likes it raw,

225
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,311
everyone looks fishy

226
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:58,013
in this design we're calling
Catch of the Day.

227
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,783
You'll never blend
into the background.

228
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:05,287
You'll tuna roll all over it.

229
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,623
That last joke made me feel
a little eel.

230
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,958
Aah!

231
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,860
Up next, Rosé and Denali.

232
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,363
Here's Button Foster.

233
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:17,600
Zipper? I hardly flipper!

234
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:21,404
I like big buttons,
and I cannot lie.

235
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,507
Up next, Tamisha Iman
and Elliott With 2 Ts.

236
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:28,310
What's the matter,
Carole Baskin got your tongue?

237
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,713
- Did you say Carole Baskin?
- Carole Baskin.

238
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,982
Oh, that bitch. I hate her.

239
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,552
The Tiger King has nothing
on the House of Food Stamps.

240
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,921
This is the same dress
Carole Baskin wore

241
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,391
when she kidnapped
her husband... allegedly.

242
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,894
The one-of-a-kind dress

243
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,296
smells like
Joe's exotic bedroom.

244
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,732
This dress
is giving me jungle fever.

245
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,966
Rawr.

246
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,503
Up next, Olivia Lux and Utica.

247
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:58,474
Just in time for allergy season,
it's Utica Queen

248
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:03,703
in our growing new dress design,
photosynethe-sis.

249
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,186
This bitch is crazy.

250
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,756
Bitch, where are you going?

251
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,649
Jesus, take the bouquet.

252
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,363
And finally, LaLa Ri and Symone.

253
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,433
Fresh from the oven,
here's LaLa Ri

254
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,137
in the perfect design
to fire up your pepperoni.

255
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,206
Oh, I can tell
she's a meat lover.

256
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,642
Easy, cheesy, peasy. Pizza girl!

257
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,910
Okay, I'll take a slice.

258
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,581
Oh!

259
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,549
Nice work, ladies,

260
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,210
but one team really
sheetrocked this shit.

261
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,792
Tamisha Iman and Elliott
With 2 Ts, con-drag-ulations.

262
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:55,097
You've each won
a $2.500 gift card

263
00:10:55,121 --> 00:11:00,970
to spend on customized
home decor at Spoonflower.com.

264
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,938
Werk!

265
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,240
Bitch!

266
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:08,177
Okay, queens, now that
you're already partnered up,

267
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:11,881
it's time to hit
the dance floor.

268
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,849
For this week's maxi-challenge,

269
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,785
you'll be making
a dancing documentary

270
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,657
about the beat that defined
a generation of liberation.

271
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,592
I'm talking disco, baby.

272
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:29,732
Now, in the seventies,
disco was about freedom, divas,

273
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,901
and bringing
funky people together.

274
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,168
Aow!

275
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,104
Kinda like Drag Race does today.

276
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:39,275
So to bring the world's first
disco-mentary to life,

277
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,377
you'll need to learn
choreography,

278
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,947
and more importantly,
embody the spirit of disco.

279
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,417
Now, each team will be covering
a different chapter.

280
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,452
Tina, Kandy, and Gottmik,

281
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,088
you're covering
the birth of disco.

282
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,326
Elliott and Tamisha,
you've got disco and sex.

283
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,428
Oh!

284
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,622
Olivia Lux and Utica, Studio 54.

285
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,869
Denali and Rosé, disco fashion!

286
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,338
- Oh, cute.
- Ooh!

287
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,942
LaLa Ri and Symone,
you've got disco sucks.

288
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,610
Okay.

289
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,579
You know how to suck, don't you?

290
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,048
- Sho' do.
- Oh, my.

291
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,383
Hey, are y'all ready
to boogie-oogie-oogie?

292
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,085
- Yes!
- Yes!

293
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,487
Racers, start your engines,

294
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:29,325
and may the best
dancing queen win.

295
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,529
Yay, dancing challenges!

296
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,297
This is what I do.

297
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,966
I feel very underestimated

298
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,233
in this competition
by the other girls,

299
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,936
but this is my moment

300
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,662
to let them know
who they dealing with.

301
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,609
Girl, come on, disco inferno.

302
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,478
I think, like, finger dancing.

303
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,647
This week's maxi-challenge
is a disco-mentary.

304
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,849
And then roll it.

305
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,218
I love disco, I love dancing.

306
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,021
It is my challenge to win.

307
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,422
So we gonna be telling
the story of disco

308
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,225
through dance, baby, yes.

309
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,893
This just feels like home.

310
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,795
When I hear disco,
it just sends, like,

311
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,531
a little sensation through
my body, like, ooh, hah!

312
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,125
Baby, she make you
wanna move.

313
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,239
Jeez, that hair actually
makes Tina look small.

314
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:26,849
Tina, your hair
finally makes you look small.

315
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,085
I mean, if I stand next
to LaLa, I'll be good.

316
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,254
Huh?

317
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,456
♪ Ooh-ee, ooh-ee ♪

318
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,091
- Hi!
- Yay!

319
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,459
Who's got boogie fever?

320
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,795
- Yes!
- Boogie-woogie!

321
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,432
All right, Denali and Rosé,
come on down.

322
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,167
- Hi.
- Hi.

323
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,935
So what made you
gravitate together?

324
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,604
You know, we both come
from dancing,

325
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:49,705
choreography backgrounds,

326
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,106
so we just really get
counts and music

327
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,107
and everything like that.

328
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,108
Right.

329
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,810
Not only can we show off
what we can do,

330
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,078
but we can really push it,

331
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,981
because she's at
a similar level to me.

332
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,850
So you all are representing
disco fashion.

333
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,885
Yes, we are.

334
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:03,886
I used to work on cruise ships,

335
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,521
and they would make us spotlight

336
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,955
and work on a lot
of the production shows.

337
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,390
And one of them was
Saturday Night Fever,

338
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,759
so I'm very versed
in Bee Gees and their music.

339
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,795
So you worked on a cruise ship.

340
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,229
There's no ice skating
on cruise ships.

341
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,497
There is, actually.

342
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,598
- Ice skating?
- Yeah.

343
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,567
Oh, you fully ice skated
on a cruise ship?

344
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,568
I did, yeah.

345
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:19,935
There were ice rinks,

346
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,670
and they would employ 10 skaters
from all around the world,

347
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,439
and we would do production shows
for the guests on board.

348
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,640
It was a lot of fun.

349
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,608
But the boat is rocking
while you're performing,

350
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,444
and it's hard to do a spin.

351
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:31,046
Yeah, we would spin,
we would jump, we did it all.

352
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,016
Wow. Now, Rosé, you came
very close last week

353
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,585
to actually winning.

354
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,321
How are you gonna make sure
that you win this week?

355
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,723
Fuck. Let go.

356
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,091
I think I'm holding on
a bit too much.

357
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,759
And I'm doing well.

358
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,761
I've been in the top
three weeks in a row now.

359
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:49,198
But, like, I still feel like I
haven't let my guard fully down

360
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,365
in front of you all.

361
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,900
You know, I think
you're absolutely right.

362
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,268
- Yeah.
- Because there's a feeling

363
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,571
that you're saying
to the judges,

364
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,739
you ain't gonna get me.

365
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,840
You ain't gonna break me down.

366
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:01,043
And it's a strategy,

367
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:05,214
but it doesn't allow people
to fall in love with you.

368
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,949
You're clearly very talented,

369
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:08,617
but people fall in love

370
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,754
out of honesty
and vulnerability.

371
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,988
I can't make it perfect,

372
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,423
so I gotta stop trying
to make it perfect.

373
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,492
- Yeah, perfect is overrated.
- Yeah.

374
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,026
Perfect is actually
kind of boring.

375
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,062
- Yeah.
- When you are in a disco

376
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,630
and you've got the lights going

377
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,032
and you're dancing around and
you're connecting to that beat,

378
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,502
something magical happens.

379
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:29,204
This is an opportunity for you
to just let it all hang out.

380
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,173
All right,
I can't wait to see you.

381
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,174
- Thank you, Ru.
- Thank you, Ru.

382
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:35,544
All right, Symone, LaLa Ri.

383
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,815
So, now, you all are
representing disco sucks.

384
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,183
- Disco sucks.
- Okay.

385
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,918
So what do you know about disco?

386
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,987
I don't know much about disco.

387
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,822
- Uh-huh.
- Of course, Sylvester.

388
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,056
What do you about Sylvester?

389
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,726
I think he was, like,
a gay pioneer.

390
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,094
And what do you know
about disco?

391
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,428
There's a lot
of movin' and groovin',

392
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,597
a lot of colors, big hair.

393
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,333
What do you know about
the disco sucks movement.

394
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:00,235
I have never heard of it
until today.

395
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,637
The disco sucks movement
happened in Chicago.

396
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,305
A deejay in Chicago

397
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:06,875
had everyone bring down
a pile of disco records

398
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,045
to this stadium and set
these disco records on fire.

399
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,047
- Really?
- Wait, I didn't know that.

400
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,852
It was this revolt that
signaled the "end" of disco,

401
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,987
- but disco never really ended.
- Right.

402
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,589
People, the powers that be,
they get scared

403
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:25,394
by uncaged, unbridled passion,
which is what disco is about.

404
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,628
You know, with rock music,

405
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,930
you dance to rock music
like this.

406
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,832
Mm-hmm.

407
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,133
But you don't do this.

408
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,401
Right.

409
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,802
That is a revolution.

410
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,870
- Yes.
- Yeah.

411
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:37,639
And also, it's
associated with gay,

412
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,374
Black music, freedom,

413
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,143
and that scared a lot of people,

414
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,211
because they couldn't
control it.

415
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:46,348
So that is why
disco sucks happened,

416
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,383
and that's what
you are representing

417
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:50,118
in this disco-mentary.

418
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:53,322
And just for the record,
disco does not suck.

419
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,623
Okay.

420
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,657
All right, kids, can't wait
to see you out there.

421
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,925
All right.

422
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,896
All right, Gottmik,
Kandy Muse, and Tina Burner.

423
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,097
- Hello!
- Hi!

424
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,299
So who knows
anything about disco?

425
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,567
You know how the Pussycat Dolls

426
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,768
had that one music video,
Hush, Hush,

427
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:07,903
and then it goes into that...

428
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,771
I Will Survive? I will Survive?

429
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,973
That's, like what I know.

430
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,175
If you were closer to me,
I'd slap you.

431
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,413
This bit that you all are doing,

432
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,717
it has to do with the roots
of disco and New York City.

433
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,521
Every disco had people
from uptown, downtown,

434
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,358
gay, straight, Black,
white, Latin, men, women,

435
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,959
everybody was there together,

436
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:35,597
and it is such an expression
of love and soul and unity.

437
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:40,269
So, Tina, if I say name your
top three disco records,

438
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:41,470
what would they be?

439
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,406
Knock On Wood, Thelma Houston.

440
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,975
That's not Thelma Houston, but...

441
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,677
- Or, um...
- Amy Stewart.

442
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,145
- Amy Stewart.
- Yeah.

443
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,214
- Don't Leave Me This Way.
- Thelma Houston, yeah.

444
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,082
And I Will Survive, Diana Ross.

445
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,817
Well, you know, she covered it.

446
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,519
- Yeah.
- It's Gloria Gaynor's song.

447
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,553
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

448
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,822
You got me good.
You got me real good.

449
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,792
Do you have three favorite
disco songs, Gottmik?

450
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,562
Hmm. Probably
somewhere in there.

451
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,265
But I think I might keep them
to myself for right now.

452
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,267
Kandy, what's the difference

453
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,594
between Diana Ross
and Donna Summer?

454
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,573
- Did you know the difference?
- No, definitely, yeah.

455
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,108
"No, definitely?"

456
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,110
No, no, like,
no as in, like, yes.

457
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,513
Like, no, definitely, yes.

458
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,014
Like, no, yeah. Like, yeah.

459
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,850
Uh-huh. That's definitely no.

460
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,110
Please, give a synopsis.

461
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,990
Okay.

462
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,860
I know the difference.

463
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:44,423
One has big, curly, bouncy hair,
you know, Mahogany.

464
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,938
And the other one's dead.

465
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,875
So listen, I will see you
on the dance floor.

466
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,377
Yes, you will.

467
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,812
It's gonna be fabulous.

468
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,414
Oh, it's gonna be good.
This is gonna be good.

469
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,116
All right, ladies, gather round.

470
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,719
Gather round, queens.

471
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,822
Now, in a few minutes
you'll head to the main stage

472
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:11,793
to turn the beat around with
choreographer Miguel Zarate.

473
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,396
So good luck, my disco ducks,

474
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,032
and don't fuck it up.

475
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,305
I wanna be
in the top this week.

476
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,208
After fucking up that first,
like, group challenge, girl,

477
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,676
I need to, crk-crk-crk-crk.

478
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,144
You'll be okay.

479
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:33,548
Do y'all think it's gonna be
judged on group or individual?

480
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,850
I'm not sure, because, bitch,

481
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,085
if there's, like,
some partnering bullshit

482
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,520
and then, like,
one person fucks up,

483
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,122
like, you know, who knows?

484
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,057
Imagine it's, like,
you'll be judged as partners,

485
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,592
and then your partner and you
are in the bottom

486
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,293
and you have to lip sync
against your partner.

487
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,529
See, that could be what it is.

488
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,298
Uh-uh!

489
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,800
Don't tell that to the universe!

490
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:54,636
I can see a three-way lip sync,
and then double elimination.

491
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,805
Um, I'm in that group.

492
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,241
That's fucked up.

493
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,375
This is a dancing challenge,

494
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,877
and I should have picked
a dancing queen.

495
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,012
Had I known,
I wouldn't have chosen

496
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,747
two bitches with two left feet.

497
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,617
And now here I am. Fuck my life.

498
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,422
Hi!

499
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,756
How are you guys?

500
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,558
- Hi!
- Hello!

501
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,060
It's time to learn choreography.

502
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,761
I wanna feel transported

503
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,497
when I move my body
to the disco beat.

504
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,300
Hi, ladies.
My name is Miguel Zarate,

505
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,203
and I'm here to teach you some
moves for the disco-mentary.

506
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,439
Don't take yourself
too seriously.

507
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:31,573
Disco's about
having a lot of fun,

508
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,241
and that's really
what I'm looking for.

509
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,043
So we should just get to it.

510
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,044
Let me start with the trio.

511
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,746
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

512
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,981
So you guys start it off.

513
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,317
It's the birth of disco,
so we're gonna start

514
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,153
with a little dance
called the Seat belt.

515
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,188
Sounds gorgeous.

516
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,357
One, two, three, four.

517
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,062
Right now, it looks
a little up and flighty.

518
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,498
It's gotta be down and dirtier
and a little grimier.

519
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:59,634
All together, from the top.
Hit and the top.

520
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,504
Hit and a boom
and a boom and a boom.

521
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:06,174
Our mean girl trio,
they look cute.

522
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,744
And I say that facetiously.

523
00:21:11,137 --> 00:21:13,715
That's strong, woom,
strong, woom.

524
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,218
And a boom and a boom
and a boom and a boom.

525
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:19,387
Much better except for Mik.

526
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,291
Grrr.

527
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,760
Grrr.

528
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,297
Okay, your song is Disco Sucks.

529
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,566
It's about your pussy
being on fire,

530
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,936
serving it hot,
and not apologizing for it.

531
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,572
Shuffle low, shuffle low.

532
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,008
Shuffle high, shuffle high.

533
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:43,512
Okay, you're going hip,
and I'm going dick.

534
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,046
Let's work on that.

535
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,149
Let's just stay in place
and then go...

536
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,017
down, pop it up,

537
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,552
down, pop it up,

538
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:52,220
down, thrust it.

539
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,755
Don't hurt yourself, LaLa.

540
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,459
You're still competing
tomorrow, girl.

541
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,960
Ooh, hah!

542
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:04,166
Elliott With 2 Ts and Tamisha,
your category is sex.

543
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,367
- Yes.
- I want you to think hot,

544
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,170
- I want you to think heavy.
- Yes.

545
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,205
And I want you
to think hula-hoop.

546
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,806
Hula-hoop?

547
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,608
Yes.

548
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,777
I don't want
no damn hula-hoop-a!

549
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,747
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going, keep it going.

550
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,849
Thrust it forward, thrust it
forward, thrust it forward.

551
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:22,017
Wow, that's a lot.

552
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,451
Sexy is cute,

553
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:26,955
but the hula-hoop part,
what the hell?

554
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:29,624
And-a push and-a push
and-a push. relax the face,

555
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,626
Have fun, aow.

556
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,285
Five, six, seven, eight.

557
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,233
Elliott's like, one, two,
three, four, five.

558
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:41,736
And I'm like, one, four...
No, wait a minute, one... five...

559
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,938
Okay.

560
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,674
- You got it, babe.
- I hate it.

561
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:51,112
I'm trying, but at the end of
the day, I have another problem.

562
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,915
It's not just the cancer.

563
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:57,352
I'm here with an ostomy bag
on my stomach.

564
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,823
It's an open wound,
and it limits my mobility.

565
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,892
I can't do the things
that I normally could do.

566
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,060
Here we go, one more time.

567
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,095
Five, six, seven, have fun.

568
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,230
Funk it up, funk it up.

569
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,831
Having the ostomy,

570
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,499
and I didn't even mention this
to the other contestants.

571
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,001
I haven't asked
for special treatment.

572
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,470
I'm gonna always try
to rise to the occasion

573
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,638
off of my abilities.

574
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,608
Yes, werk! That's nice!

575
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,443
You guys, that's awesome.

576
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:24,613
It's a lot, but, you know,
at the end of the day,

577
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,015
everybody know fame costs.

578
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,420
All right,
your theme is fashion.

579
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,224
You have the most dance-heavy
of the sections.

580
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,359
♪ Hey ♪

581
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,361
You're gonna do pas de bourree,
pas de bourree.

582
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,596
Turn, out, step, touch.

583
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,467
Do you want that to fan,
or do you want it to break?

584
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:46,735
Not that, bitch.

585
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,038
- I'm open to either/or.
- Let's do fan.

586
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,474
Pas de bourree, pas de bourree
bring it in.

587
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,277
This is the strongest technical
team when it comes to dancing.

588
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,045
Me and Rosé, we're killing it.

589
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,847
I'm really hoping that
I can win this challenge.

590
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,582
Beautiful, ladies.
Thank you guys so much.

591
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,917
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Miguel.

592
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,551
Great job, great job, great job.

593
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,254
Our choreography is definitely
the most challenging

594
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,522
out of all the girls.

595
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:11,259
My biggest concern
for this challenge is...

596
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,862
winning.

597
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:15,764
All right, we have
Olivia and Utica.

598
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,466
Studio 54, it's like
confetti in a can.

599
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,634
And what we're gonna do

600
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,369
is bring that confetti
to life using this flag.

601
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,437
Here we go.

602
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,006
Go, one, two, three, four,

603
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,941
and five, six, seven, good.

604
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,211
And outside and up. Lay out.

605
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,981
Utica!

606
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:36,384
Olivia and Utica, I mean, one of
them is doing the choreo wrong,

607
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:39,888
and by the looks on Olivia's
face, it's not Olivia.

608
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,923
One, two, three, four,

609
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,159
and five, around. No chainé.

610
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:48,163
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

611
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,855
- And then out.
- Oh, my God.

612
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:56,271
Miss Utica and this...

613
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,506
Yeah. Whoo!

614
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,077
Miss Utica and this little
piece of fabric, girl.

615
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,646
This little piece of fabric
is tearing her up.

616
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,748
Utica, get out of your head,

617
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:07,982
because your creativity
is amazing.

618
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,151
When you let
your creativity flow,

619
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,053
like, I can't stop
looking at you.

620
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:15,223
But the second you don't,
I don't wanna look at you.

621
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,358
Ooh.

622
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:17,559
I'm telling myself,

623
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:19,627
I can do this, I can do this,
I can do this.

624
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,863
I am a great dancer,
I am a great dancer.

625
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,098
Like, I can do this!

626
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,900
But Olivia is full-on
disco inferno

627
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:26,935
happening in partnership-land.

628
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,070
So I have, like,
some big shoes to fill

629
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,538
if I'm gonna compete with her.

630
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,574
Let's go. Yeah!

631
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,620
Today we are gonna be performing

632
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,957
our disco-ography
on the main stage.

633
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:53,419
And I'm gonna feel disco
right up into my tuck, honey.

634
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,799
How are we feeling?

635
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,234
Here's the thing.

636
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:00,502
Like, we just have
strong personalities,

637
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,536
so we have to show
the personality on the stage.

638
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,071
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

639
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,606
I know that everyone looks at us

640
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,742
as, like, the loud bitches
in the room.

641
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,010
But, baby, can we deliver?

642
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,278
That's the real tea.

643
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,381
And I think we can.

644
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,783
Yeah, no, we're gonna kill this.

645
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,384
- We're gonna fucking slay it.
- Yes, hands in the middle.

646
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,385
All right.

647
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,354
Mean girls on three.
One, two, three.

648
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:20,855
- Mean girls.
- Mean girls.

649
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:22,223
Oh, is that the clique?

650
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,658
Oh, is that the clique?

651
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:26,227
Some people think we're bitches,
but guess what?

652
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,197
Drag queens are very loud,
outspoken.

653
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,665
We push buttons.

654
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,434
You wanna call it mean,
call it mean.

655
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,860
Move over, Dream Girls,
it's the Mean Girls.

656
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,474
How do you feel, Olivia?

657
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,975
I feel really good.

658
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,811
Yeah, you was up there
twirling with that flag, and...

659
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:43,978
Right.

660
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,079
I always wanted
to be in the color guard,

661
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,247
you know what I mean?

662
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,315
- Really?
- Yeah.

663
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,184
I mean, I was in marching band.

664
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,253
I played the piccolo, and
it was the smallest instrument

665
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,156
for the biggest kid
on the field.

666
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,492
I used to be almost 300 pounds.

667
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:59,294
- Really?
- Yeah.

668
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:03,498
I just remember kinda getting
teased about my weight.

669
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:07,836
I was so insecure because
I was still in the closet.

670
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,440
And I was battling
with, like, my identity,

671
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,076
and it just was, like, a lot.

672
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,313
It just was a really dark time

673
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,182
that I felt like
I just couldn't be myself

674
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,617
and couldn't be a kid.

675
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,152
Like, going through
what we went through

676
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:27,088
and the rehearsals and stuff
just reminds me

677
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:31,226
that I wasn't able to do
what I'm able to do now always.

678
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,928
You know, I remember
going to the amusement parks,

679
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,264
and there was one time where
I got turned away from a ride.

680
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,333
- Oh, my God.
- I couldn't fit in the seat

681
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,034
to even secure myself, so...

682
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:41,569
When did you lose weight?

683
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:46,140
In high school, my mom...
We went to the doctor,

684
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,545
and the doctor said, like,
the dreaded "O" word to my mom.

685
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,380
- Like, your son's obese.
- Obese?

686
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:56,384
And my mom was just, like, we
gotta do something about this.

687
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,853
And I was on, like,
strict diets,

688
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,122
and that's when I found,
like, theater and drama

689
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,792
and that kind of all ended up
turning into, like, drag.

690
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,794
Yeah. Olivia Lux, darling.

691
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,862
Olivia Lux.

692
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,264
It took a long time

693
00:28:09,288 --> 00:28:13,468
for me to be confident
with my own body, myself,

694
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,603
and now I don't even
look at the scale.

695
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:19,674
As long as I feel amazing,
that's all that matters.

696
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:24,579
I guess in a way, drag saved
my well-being and my health.

697
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,114
Drag is the new diet.

698
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,249
Right. Try it sometime.

699
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,120
You really have no idea
what people have gone through,

700
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,888
and when you learn about it,

701
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:37,825
it really shows why they are
that person that they are.

702
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,686
Her journey created who
she is today, and I love her.

703
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,868
I admire you a lot, Kandy,

704
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:49,070
because you are very much
yourself at all times.

705
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,738
And your personality
is so infectious.

706
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,041
And, like, the thing is
I know sometimes, like,

707
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,009
it comes out
a little bit abrasive

708
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,310
and too loud to some people.

709
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,478
Tell us about your favorite
fight you've ever had.

710
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,581
My favorite fight I've ever had?

711
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:03,318
Girl, the one with the battle
of my inner demons, baby.

712
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:06,054
Ooh, tell us about that.

713
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,789
Well, I mean, all my life

714
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,658
has just been, like, a battle
with just, like, myself.

715
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,226
My mother was, like,
in and out of jail,

716
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,729
and just, like, you know,
all I knew was the streets.

717
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,097
And on the streets,
you have to be, like,

718
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,566
you know, girl, hood-smart.

719
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,767
I've always felt like
I've had to defend myself,

720
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,836
whether it was, like,
at a job or in school

721
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,838
or in a relationship,
whatever the case may be.

722
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,573
If I was, like,
faced with an obstacle,

723
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,442
girl, I was gonna go ham.

724
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,344
Growing up,
everyone always told me,

725
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,778
like, "You're not good enough,

726
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,046
and you're not gonna
amount to anything."

727
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,414
And, like, even, like,
last time on Untucked,

728
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,849
when I was, like, going off,

729
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:36,784
like, in that moment I felt like
I needed to defend myself.

730
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,519
And I try not to be that way.

731
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,889
When me and Tamisha
had that little debacle,

732
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,058
it felt like it was definitely
a setback for me,

733
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,161
because I've worked so hard
to not be that angry person.

734
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,030
It took me 10 steps back,

735
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:53,001
because I haven't been like that
in a very long time.

736
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:54,636
Learning and growing every day.

737
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,561
Learning and growing
every day, diva.

738
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,310
You have lived, like,
five different lifetimes.

739
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:05,513
Okay. But, you know,
I look back on it often,

740
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,514
and I wouldn't trade it
for the world.

741
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:07,582
I grew up in the projects.

742
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:08,983
Did you really?
Oh, I didn't know that.

743
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,351
Yeah, I grew up in the projects.

744
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,753
We had members in the community

745
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,988
that tried to keep the kids
out of trouble and whatnot.

746
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,624
There was this one particular
lady named Ms. Kemp.

747
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,959
She started, like,
a little cheerleading group.

748
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,194
We didn't have no football team
or nothing like that,

749
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,929
but she gave the girls
something to do.

750
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:24,732
Dance, cheerleading,
whatever your talent is,

751
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:26,567
Ms. Kemp wanted
to bring it out of you.

752
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,536
I would always go to practice
with her and whatnot,

753
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,838
and my nickname was Booty.

754
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:31,873
- Booty?
- Booty.

755
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:32,874
I've seen it.

756
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:36,077
So she was like,
"Booty can flip."

757
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,379
When she figured out that
I could flip, I could split,

758
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:39,747
I could do all those things,

759
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,784
but no one had ever
allowed me to do it.

760
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,852
Mind you, I'm up there
just having fun,

761
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,554
not knowing
what the hell's going on.

762
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,022
My grandmother got wind

763
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:51,826
that I'm up here doing gay stuff
or whatever, whatever.

764
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,860
And she was like,
"No, boys don't do this

765
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,262
and boys don't do that."

766
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,564
Ms. Kemp was actually the one
who gave me my foundation

767
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,499
and let me know that
I was talented, you know?

768
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,468
I'm grateful for the lady
in my community

769
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,370
that took a chance on me.

770
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:04,706
That's why I became,
you know, who I am:

771
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,007
the mother of the House of Iman.

772
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:09,043
I always wanted to actually
make it to Hollywood.

773
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,745
Well, you're here now, babe.

774
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,014
I said, like, I'm
actually living my dream.

775
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,115

776
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,579

877
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,210
And there was no shade
in Evelyn Champagne King's day.

878
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:46,247
But one disco queen paved
the way for the rest of us.

879
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,916
The fearless
and flamboyant Sylvester

880
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,920

00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:30,691
the disco revolution
was under attack.

891
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:34,728
Haters shouted, "Disco sucks!"

892
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,665
They set our records on fire,

893
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,335
and our dreams
became a disco inferno.

894
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,705
Disco sucks!

895
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,107

They tried to kill
what we loved,

905
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:21,375
but disco never died.

906
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,211
It just changed
its name and address.

907
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,613
Today, disco reminds us

908
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,583
that our souls are connected
through spirit,

909
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:33,788

we can do anything.

Category is Little Black Dress.

926
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,370
First up, Tina Burner.

927
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,005
Gimme more.
Benjamin Moore.

928
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,608
It is time
to bring some color

929
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,643
into the drab
little black dress.

930
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,279
I am serving you a what?

931
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,747
Ru-veal, and all of a sudden

932
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:37,851
I am serving
paint splattered fantasy.

933
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,553
I feel like
all the boys in the yard

934
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,589
were painting
the motherfucking fence,

935
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,624
and they came up and grabbed
my titties and my ass.

936
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:46,327
Because I am what?
I'm looking that good.

937
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:49,597
All hands
on deck... and my ass.

938
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,965
Paint misbehavin'.

939
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,201
Kandy Muse.

940
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,003
Oh, I'm noticing
a pattern here.

941
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,206
Very sketchy.

942
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,409
Baby, I have on my
Christina Stambolian creation.

943
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:05,446
This dress is made
out of canvas paper

944
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,248
with a hand-painted
little black dress.

945
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:09,917
My hair is wet with oil paint,

946
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,986
and if you look real closely,

947
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,623
this is the revenge dress
that Princess Diana wore.

948
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:16,824
Thank you very much.

949
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:19,226
No more wire hangers!

950
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:21,762
Gottmik.

951
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:23,264
Ooh!

952
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,866
the little black merkin.

953
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,902
You know, I used to go
to that dry cleaner,

954
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:28,903
but no more.

955
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,706
I'm giving you
the littlest black dress.

956
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,375
I'm full naked.

957
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,878
A year ago, I would never
have done this.

958
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,248
I couldn't be happier
with how I look right now.

959
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,316
Wow.

960
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,286
There's a cold,
naked Barbie somewhere.

961
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,523
Elliott With 2 Ts.

962
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,359
The Real Housewives
of Paramus.

963
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:57,631
This look is just
full-on rich, opulent woman.

964
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,967
Every once in a while,

965
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,802
someone will have
to double-take at me

966
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,371
and go, "Is that
a man or a woman?"

967
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,407
It is the complete
transformation,

968
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,075
it's the illusion,

969
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,743
and that's what I love
about my drag.

970
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,613
The funeral home
is her pickup bar.

971
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:19,386
Tamisha Iman.
Come on, Dominique Deveraux.

972
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,156
This champagne is burnt.

973
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,726
I wanted to bring
a nice, clean black dress.

974
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,294
One of my many creations.

975
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,496
Any time I hit the runway,
I'm doing a classy lady walk.

976
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,432
I want them
to see Diahann Carroll.

977
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:36,003
I want and need them to see
a Black, classy woman,

978
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,072
and I need them
to see Black excellence.

979
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:41,108
Our lovely
Black butterfly, baby.

980
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,376
Olivia Lux.

981
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,944
Oh, this old thing?

982
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,646
It's just a Sunday afternoon.

983
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,780
Uh-huh.

984
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,048
She is working
the micro-berkin.

985
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,316
Ooh.

986
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,584
This is not
your ordinary walk,

987
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,618
ladies and gentlemen.

988
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,420
This is a strut.

989
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:58,158
I am giving you
supermodel vibes.

990
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,227
My little black dress
fits every curve of my body.

991
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,197
I feel beautiful.

992
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,666
Bring back my curls.

993
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,339
Utica Queen.
Who the queen?

994
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,841
You the queen.

995
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,343
So my little black dress
is inspired by Audrey Hepburn,

996
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,278
and these beautiful
little earrings that I have.

997
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,581
I wanted to become the earrings,

998
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,449
so I have my earring
back on my hat,

999
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,120
and I am strutting down
the runway in shades of gold.

1000
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:30,057
I'm definitely feeling like
my true, authentic self in art,

1001
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,659
and I'm really excited
about this concept.

1002
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,895
Her head says,
"I'm a hooker."

1003
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,765
Denali.

1004
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:41,502
She's starring in
the Queef of the Spider Woman.

1005
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,939
My, what a tangled web
we weave.

1006
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,476
I am serving you
Mommy Longlegs

1007
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,746
in my arachnid-inspired
little black widow dress.

1008
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,382
The back of my dress
has gorgeous beading.

1009
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,717
Call me Charlotte,

1010
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,520
because I am spinning webs
and turning heads.

1011
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:02,489
I am widowed, but plot twist:

1012
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,858
I killed that motherfucker.

1013
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:05,993
Oh.

1014
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:07,461
Michelle,
her eyes are up there.

1015
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,697
Rosé.

1016
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,233
If you squeeze her dress,
her tulle pops out.

1017
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,837
Simply showing up
to RuPaul's Drag Race

1018
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,806
with a little black dress
would be boring,

1019
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,375
so I've got this
beautiful grey tulle

1020
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,711
framing my truly
little black dress.

1021
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,347
This look is definitely
a little bit camp,

1022
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:29,416
but it's also very sexy,

1023
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,751
and I feel like a million bucks,

1024
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:34,154
so I'm soaking up every minute
on this runway.

1025
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,857
Anyone else hungry
for a Hot Pocket?

1026
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:39,693
LaLa Ri.

1027
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,895
Read my lips.

1028
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,768
Any time
I'm given the chance

1029
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,804
to wear something small
and little and sexy,

1030
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,006
oh, bitch, sign me up.

1031
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,042
Showing a little
piece of ass for the class.

1032
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,845
Let me use everything I got
to get everything that I want.

1033
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,513
Let's go, little black dress.

1034
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,548
Little black tube top.

1035
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,184
If that dress
were any shorter,

1036
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,321
they'd have to arrest you
for dealing crack.

1037
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:10,791
Whoo!

1038
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,892
Symone.

1039
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,427
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1040
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,929
Somebody's going
to Miss Charles' hair salon.

1041
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:21,468
I am giving you
Black hair is a revolution!

1042
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,872
And if you don't know where
that's from, let me tell you.

1043
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:28,075
This hair is a reference
to RuPaul's music video,

1044
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,143
Back To My Roots.

1045
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,646
So this little black dress
is made of braiding hair,

1046
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,847
and I am here to model.

1047
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,116
Straight from the beauty shop.

1048
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,718
Michelle,
the hair show is in town.

1049
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:40,053
Honey, Miss Hair Show 1982.

1050
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,159
So good. Damn.

1051
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,718
♪ Bring back my girls ♪

1052
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:51,155
Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

1053
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,826
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1054
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,274
Gottmik.

1055
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,209
Denali.

1056
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,101
Rosé.

1057
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,737
LaLa Ri.

1058
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,942
Symone.

1059
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,711
Queens...

1060
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,881
You are safe.

1061
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:21,819
You may leave the stage.

1062
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,836
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1063
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,396
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques...

1064
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,710
Starting with Tina Burner.

1065
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,080
This look, you obviously
give us a big dash of camp,

1066
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,448
and I love that.

1067
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:45,319
I would like the hair bigger
to balance everything out.

1068
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,087
It squashes you.
It should lift you up.

1069
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,388
Yeah.

1070
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:51,825
Your performance, though,
was out of this world.

1071
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:55,562
I love that homage-
to-Bob-Mackie beaded number.

1072
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,397
I think that beaded short dress,

1073
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:00,233
with all that movement,
was really fantastic.

1074
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,702
You took control of the stage,

1075
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,705
and you were a disco queen
to me tonight.

1076
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:05,806
Well done.

1077
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,507
Thank you very much.

1078
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,943
Up next, Kandy Muse.

1079
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,045
This look, I think
it's really fun.

1080
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,480
I like the ode to fashion,

1081
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:17,351
but I do find the hair and some
of the paint details on the face

1082
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,953
are a little distracting
and a little messy.

1083
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,888
I do wanna say about your outfit
in the disco thing, too,

1084
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:26,026
it was a little too plain
for RuPaul's Drag Race.

1085
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,930
In your performance,
you are from the boogie-down,

1086
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:30,931
you're from
the south South Bronx,

1087
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,132
and you keep it real,

1088
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,467
so we get a lot of talk
to the hand

1089
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:34,801
and a lot of...

1090
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,637
I love that about you.

1091
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,372
The one comment that I'm
gonna say about them, though,

1092
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,574
is it's always the same,

1093
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:41,608
and it kind of
doesn't go anywhere.

1094
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,844
Sometimes
when we're big and bold,

1095
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:46,880
we think we gotta be
"Whoo, chile, lawd have mercy."

1096
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:49,249
You don't have to be that
all the time.

1097
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,586
So it's a matter of giving us
other sides of Kandy Muse,

1098
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,422
so we can see that
you've got more than that.

1099
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,224
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1100
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:00,794
Up next, Elliott With 2 Ts
for your pleasure.

1101
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:05,565
I love the little black dress,
but it's too... regular.

1102
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,700
Okay.

1103
00:47:06,724 --> 00:47:09,870
And then in the challenge,
you can move.

1104
00:47:09,894 --> 00:47:11,872
- Thank you.
- You killed that shit.

1105
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:14,641
You looked like
you could have been Halston

1106
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,343
or Norma Kamali's muse.

1107
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,879
I wish I would have
gone to Studio 54

1108
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,614
when I was 10 years old
with Drew Barrymore,

1109
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:22,983
but, alas, that wasn't
in the cards for me.

1110
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,686
But you gave us that experience.

1111
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,953
It was lit-lit.

1112
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,523
Elliott, I know
you're a trained dancer.

1113
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,693
What was it that attracted you
to dance in the first place?

1114
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:36,430
I always, as a little kid, would
spin around in the living room,

1115
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:37,631
and so my mom saw it,

1116
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:40,967
and at five years old
put me in dance class.

1117
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,804
It was my escape from
the bullying and the torment

1118
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:46,473
that I received
in that small farm town.

1119
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,575
It healed me, it protected me.

1120
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,178
I've said this before
and I'll say it again.

1121
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,815
If you have a child,
put your child in dance class!

1122
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,284
Yes!

1123
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:00,220
Up next, Tamisha Iman.

1124
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,455
This outfit, for me,

1125
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,724
I'm always looking
for that twist.

1126
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:05,959
- It's a really gorgeous garment.
- Thank you.

1127
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,260
Just think about
always elevating it.

1128
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,629
- Is that neoprene?
- It is.

1129
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,064
It's not easy to work with that.

1130
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,333
But I think what's happening
a little bit with the pleating

1131
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,468
is it's so much gathering up top

1132
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:16,770
that it kind of
takes away from your figure.

1133
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:20,707
In the challenge,
it was a little bit off.

1134
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,243
You're kind of thinking
about what's coming next.

1135
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,446
I think if you just have
a little more fun and exhale,

1136
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,049
I think you're gonna perform
better and also enjoy it more.

1137
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,484
Like with anal sex.

1138
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:33,687
Exactly. Exactly.

1139
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:36,857
I'm still getting a little bit
of fear in your eyes

1140
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:38,925
when you're performing.

1141
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,093
Six months ago, I couldn't walk.

1142
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:42,295
I'm trying to get back
to the old Tamisha.

1143
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,897
So I'm fighting,
but at the same time,

1144
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,198
like you said, I'm in my head.

1145
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,068
And I'm not making excuses.
I'm just being honest.

1146
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,337
- Thank you, Tamisha.
- Thank you.

1147
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:56,076
Up next, a disco queen,
child, Miss Olivia Lux.

1148
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,144
Tonight on the runway,

1149
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:00,046
I think the hair
is what's speaking here,

1150
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,148
and we are listening.

1151
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:03,483
And then you gave us
a little twist

1152
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:05,352
with the micro-berkin I call it.

1153
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,989
I had a good time watching you.

1154
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:11,491
I thought I was back
in the disco days.

1155
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:12,893
It just... everything worked.

1156
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,929
Your disco hair was the first
thing that caught my eye.

1157
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,697
That is your hair.

1158
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,865
That's, like, your trademark,

1159
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:21,401
and it was so gorgeous
the way it moved.

1160
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,403
It was just amazing.

1161
00:49:23,427 --> 00:49:26,139
You exude positivity and joy,

1162
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,276
that disco vibe that
was so happy about that time.

1163
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,311
I think you have
what they call "It factor."

1164
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,280
I mean, it's just
you are radiant.

1165
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,182
Thank you.

1166
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:37,551
Up next, Utica Queen.

1167
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:38,985
Tonight in the challenge,

1168
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,055
I felt like I was watching
Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman

1169
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,056
meets Carol Burnett.

1170
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,692
There were so many faces
being made,

1171
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,828
I felt like I wasn't in a disco.

1172
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,564
Camp is great,
but there is a line

1173
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:54,434
where it becomes caricature
of a caricature.

1174
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:56,102
Tonight on the runway,

1175
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:59,105
I wanna know how you
came up with this look.

1176
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,841
I'm my earrings.

1177
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,309
Your earrings?

1178
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,778
Yeah, yeah, I'm my earrings.

1179
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:07,948
And then the thing
on top is the earring!

1180
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,816
- Oh, my God, you guys!
- Get it?

1181
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,418
Thank you
for explaining this look,

1182
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,419
because before, I was like,

1183
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,888
what the fuck is going on here?

1184
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,058
I mean, I loved it.
I just didn't know what it was.

1185
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:20,360
Sometimes you have to think
to yourself, you know,

1186
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:21,862
are they really
gonna understand this?

1187
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:23,697
Because it's a competition.

1188
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:26,657
Put you, but make sure
that they can understand it.

1189
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,871
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1190
00:50:30,895 --> 00:50:33,540
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1191
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:36,033
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1192
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:41,081
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

1193
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,215
whaddaya think?

1194
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,217
Tina Burner.

1195
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,852
When she came out
during that performance,

1196
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,155
the other two, I forgot them,
and I was looking at Tina.

1197
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,457
She's a real showgirl.

1198
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,259
That dress was fantastic.

1199
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:54,928
Gangbusters when she came out
on that stage.

1200
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:56,630
Kandy Muse.

1201
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,132
I feel like her content needs
to catch up to her personality,

1202
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,300
if that makes sense.

1203
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,402
I want her
to go above and beyond

1204
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,204
what comes naturally for her.

1205
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,907
I want her to push herself
out of her comfort zone.

1206
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:08,041
It would have been funny

1207
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,442
if she played
almost like a dumb blonde,

1208
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,577
which is total opposite,

1209
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,045
and it could have been
really fun

1210
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,980
and we wouldn't have
taken our eyes off of her.

1211
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:18,919
Kandy Muse did not capture
the spirit of the disco-mentary.

1212
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,720
Elliott With 2 Ts.

1213
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,323
Elliott could dance,
and she let us have it tonight.

1214
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:27,227
And she sold the story
with her body movement.

1215
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:28,461
As good as the disco was,

1216
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,897
the runway
was kind of disappointing.

1217
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,066
It was Sex in the City.
I love it.

1218
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,567
If the city were Albuquerque.

1219
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,305
Oh, my goodness.

1220
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,472
Tamisha.

1221
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,774
She has the chops

1222
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,143
to be competing with every one
of these girls up here.

1223
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,545
Timing was off, props were off.

1224
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,281
We have to critique her
on what we saw.

1225
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:52,018
In this challenge she was timid,

1226
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:56,089
and you could see in her eyes
that she was unsure of herself.

1227
00:51:56,113 --> 00:52:00,860
The pros for Tamisha
is that she is a survivor.

1228
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:05,231
It's a tough one, because she's
still finding her sea legs.

1229
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:09,960
Do we judge her like anyone else
who enters this competition?

1230
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:12,472
Olivia Lux.

1231
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:14,541
Olivia's like
Michelle Visage: easy.

1232
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:15,842
Yes!

1233
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,744
Everything is easy for her.

1234
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:19,679
I was just, like, looking at her

1235
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,582
and enjoying the radiance

1236
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,251
and the good energy
that is Olivia Lux.

1237
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,053
You couldn't take
your eyes off of her

1238
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:31,658
because she is a frickin' star.

1239
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:35,695
There's a warm feeling
that she projects on stage

1240
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,764
that you can't buy that.

1241
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:39,499
Utica Queen.

1242
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:40,800
We shouldn't have had to dig

1243
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,436
and ask to know that
it was a two-inch-long earring

1244
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,606
that none of us would have
ever been able to see.

1245
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,774
- Drag is a visual medium.
- Yeah.

1246
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,442
We need to see it
and get the joke.

1247
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:53,179
I love the kind of queen she is,
but when she was performing,

1248
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,582
she does this thing
with her body

1249
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:58,551
that she's almost making
a joke out of everything

1250
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:02,722
in a way that is distracting
from the piece.

1251
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,158
She would not
have gotten in Studio 54

1252
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,060
with that outfit
that she had on.

1253
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:08,361
She would have been
on the ropes.

1254
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:10,997
Crimped, long hair,
yes, that was a seventies thing.

1255
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,332
But when you pull it back

1256
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:15,502
into, like, you know,
an Eleanor Roosevelt low pony,

1257
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,871
it's not hot. Sorry.

1258
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,077
Silence! Enough is enough.

1259
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:25,879
Bring back my girls.

1260
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,814
Where they at?

1261
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:28,915
Get 'em back.

1262
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:33,620
Welcome back, ladies.

1263
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,512
I've made some decisions.

1264
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:39,759
Tina Burner,

1265
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,586
That's the way,
uh-huh, uh-huh, we like it.

1266
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,433
You're safe.

1267
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,891
You may join the other girls.

1268
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,239
Olivia Lux.

1269
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,210
This week, you gave us
a sweet love hangover,

1270
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,546
and I don't want no cure.

1271
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,314
Okay.

1272
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,184
Con-drag-ulations, You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

1273
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:10,690
You've won a cash tip of $5.000.

1274
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:11,691
I won?

1275
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,060
I won my first challenge.

1276
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:17,764
And it feels so amazing.

1277
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,766
You're finally seeing me.

1278
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,825
I am a force
to be reckoned with.

1279
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:29,109
Elliott With 2 Ts, you're safe.

1280
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:30,334
Thank you so much.

1281
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,747
Tamisha Iman.

1282
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:38,342
This week, you looked
a little panicked at the disco.

1283
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:40,820
Kandy Muse.

1284
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:43,156
You gave us earth and wind,

1285
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,648
but we needed fire.

1286
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:48,428
Utica Queen.
The judges wanted you

1287
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,921
to feel more mighty real.

1288
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,694
Syracuse, Schenectady, Utica...

1289
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,963
You're safe.

1290
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:02,642
Thank you.

1291
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:10,683
Kandy Muse, Tamisha Iman,

1292
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:14,788
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1293
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:18,625
Kandy and Tamisha
literally just fought it out,

1294
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:21,027
and now they're in
the bottom two together.

1295
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,463
Kandy cannot go home right now,

1296
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,232
so she better slay this shit.

1297
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,934
Two queens stand before me.

1298
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:31,271
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1299
00:55:31,295 --> 00:55:35,399
and save yourself
from elimination.

1300
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,145
The time has come...

1301
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,115
for you to lip sync...

1302
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:44,984
for your life.

1303
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:50,723

Kandy Muse, shantay you stay.

1350
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,954
Thank you so much.

1351
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,223
You may join the other girls.

1352
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,438
Tamisha Iman.

1353
00:58:18,462 --> 00:58:23,109
You're a fighter,
a survivor, and a star.

1354
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:26,713
Thank you for
the amazing opportunity.

1355
00:58:26,737 --> 00:58:27,814
I'm truly grateful.

1356
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,049
Thank you to each
and every one of you

1357
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:32,418
from the bottom of my heart.

1358
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,886
Thank you.

1359
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,289
I never can say goodbye,

1360
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:41,561
so until we meet again,
I'll just say sashay away.

1361
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,564
Tamisha!

1362
00:58:44,588 --> 00:58:45,989
Tamisha!

1363
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,569
Come here, babe.

1364
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:50,937
Kill it.

1365
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,606
No tea, no tea, no deal,
no deal, no deal, no deal.

1366
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,842
Do what you do.
I'll see you on the road.

1367
00:58:57,434 --> 00:58:59,278
It's not the end.
It's just till we meet again.

1368
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:04,951
I don't want anybody to feel sad
that Tamisha's going home.

1369
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,652
I was so worried about

1370
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,654
are they gonna find out
that I got an ostomy?

1371
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:09,956
Is it gonna hold me back?

1372
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,058
Every competition,
you don't have to win.

1373
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,526
Sometimes you just
have to show up,

1374
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,029
and this is part of my legacy.

1375
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,264
This gave me the drive,
determination that I needed

1376
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,400
to return back
to the art form that I love.

1377
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:22,769
Going home is not a bad thing,
because I can go home

1378
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,670
and actually heal
to get ready for All Stars.

1379
00:59:26,363 --> 00:59:27,974
And I'm gonna
start working tomorrow,

1380
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:30,233
so whenever the call come,
I'm ready.

1381
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,982
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1382
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:38,918
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1383
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,953
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1384
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,255
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1385
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:43,589
- Amen!

01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:05,244
on the trashy talk show
Bossy Rossy After Dark.
