00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,846
Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,682
I wanna introduce you
to a fabulous queen

3
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,585
who will be joining you
in the competition.

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:09,919
Uh-uh!

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:14,014
Someone I don't think
got a fair chance last week.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,260
Hello!

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,264
Elliott with 2 Ts.

8
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:22,632
Guess who's back in the house?

9
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,868
What the fuck?

10
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,972
♪ Condragulations,
you're number one ♪

11
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,207
♪ Condragulations ♪

12
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,909
Olivia Lux.

13
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,011
You're somebody that
I could not take my eye off of.

14
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,646
Symone.

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,715
You're fierce,
you're filled with attitude.

16
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,740
You've got star quality.

17
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,353
This week, there are no bottoms.

18
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,346
The rest of you are safe.

19
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,826
Symone, you're a winner, baby.

20
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,272
My gosh.

21
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,007
Girl.

22
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,575
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,611
We are just walking back into
the werkroom and guess what?

24
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,812
We're all safe.

25
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,415
This is, like,
RuPaul's Drag Race Tornado.

26
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,983
Like, there's a cow flying by.

27
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,184
Like, here comes a fence.

28
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,353
Twister. I'm, like, what next?

29
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,822
Y'all just did that.

30
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,524
Oh, my God, y'all!

31
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,559
Congratulations.

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,761
Thank y'all.

33
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,363
So, Miss Symone,
the first official winner.

34
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,364
Uh-huh.

35
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,632
How does it feel

36
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,434
to get the critique
that you got from RuPaul?

37
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,403
- Oh, my God.
- About your star quality?

38
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,405
It felt amazing.
It felt like I had...

39
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,839
Like, one of the things
I came here to do

40
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,043
and I've been validated to do,
and it came from RuPaul,

41
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,679
like, one of my idols, one
of the people I've looked up to.

42
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,181
So if nothing else happens...
But it will...

43
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,850
If nothing else happens,
that's all I needed.

44
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,218
I could die happy.

45
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,220
I mean, kudos to my sis

46
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,356
for getting that,
you know, that critique,

47
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,491
but, bitch, I know I'm the shit.

48
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:58,261
That motivates me
to even go harder.

49
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,997
Like, I can't get
complacent at all.

50
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,565
I can't even tell you,

51
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,667
when Ru said that
we were all safe,

52
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,303
like, literally,
like I couldn't handle it.

53
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,105
My heart was just, like, uh.

54
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,340
Going into elimination,
I really thought

55
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,842
that me and you were gonna
go head-to-head tonight.

56
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,177
Me, too.

57
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:15,511
All that crying for nothing.

58
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,313
All that crying for nothing.

59
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,050
Girl, I fucked
that performance up,

60
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,052
and I just felt so upset,

61
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,054
because I came here to prove
to America and the world

62
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,424
that Kandy Muse
is a fierce entertainer.

63
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,560
I need to step it up.

64
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:33,463
I couldn't see,
now getting to know you guys,

65
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,633
us voting anybody...
Each other off at all.

66
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,601
- I couldn't see that.
- It's, like, so crazy to me.

67
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,303
- That's insane.
- Yeah.

68
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,472
But that said, now knowing
what they did to you,

69
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,741
if you had to pick one girl
out of that group to send home,

70
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,609
who would it be and why?

71
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,178
I would be happy
to see them all go home.

72
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,246
Okay?

73
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,714
One by one.

74
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:55,118
The porkchop group doesn't
even know that I'm still here.

75
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,919
They think that
they sent my ass packing.

76
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,554
But RuPaul felt the need

77
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,391
to put me
in the winner's circle, girl.

78
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,727
What's up, B squad?

79
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,596
I just wonder when the fuck
they're showing up, though.

80
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,865
What are they doing,
when they're showing up,

81
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,133
when are they gonna go home?

82
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,837
Whenever we cross
these little monsters,

83
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,806
they're probably
gonna have a lot to prove.

84
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,541
That must be a weird place
to start the competition,

85
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,309
already a notch down.

86
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,945
So now they're gonna have to
double-notch to get ahead of us.

87
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,380
You gotta jump twice as high
to beat me,

88
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,115
and I am a tall bitch.

89
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,450
This is the first week,

90
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,951
so we all have to put
our hands in here real quick.

91
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,853
- Have a moment!
- Come on, bitches.

92
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,556
One, two, three,
winner's circle!

93
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,324
When the other girls come back,

94
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,360
it's gonna be
a little difficult,

95
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,529
because we named ourselves
the winner's circle.

96
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,730
Tina, you need help?

97
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,199
I'm fine. Just leave me!

98
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,526
So there's only another name
for their group.

99
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,439
I'm up!

100
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,098
Eee.

101
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,410
The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race

102
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,645
receives a one-year supply

103
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,381
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

104
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,318
and a cash prize of $100.000.

105
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:05,721
With extra-special
guest judge Nicole Byer.

Oh, my God, we're here!

111
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,402
Yeah!

112
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,037
Let's do it. We back!

113
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:22,405
- Hi, werkroom!
- We all up in here!

114
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,573
Going into the werkroom,

115
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,708
it's a new day,
and it's six of us.

116
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,610
We're excited,
but at the same time,

117
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,412
you know, we feel
for that seventh person,

118
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,248
because we know we all worked
hard to get to this point.

119
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,751
But when you give a person
a second chance to fight,

120
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,253
oh, the fight is on.

121
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,957
Aren't you so grateful,
like, we're here?

122
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,259
I've never been more grateful
to be anywhere in my life.

123
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,128
The fact that we get
a second chance is crazy.

124
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,395
Second chance!

125
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,500
There is a fire now
that is definitely ignited.

126
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,001
Which gives us an advantage.

127
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,036
We had a really good
wake-up call,

128
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,506
and the other group
has not felt that yet.

129
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,007
So I don't think they're ready

130
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,308
for what our group
is gonna bring.

131
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,711
It's so crazy seeing
all of you out of drag.

132
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,812
I'm just gonna say it.

133
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,781
I don't know
how the other team looks,

134
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:04,947
but I'm gonna say
we've definitely

135
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,415
got the trade of the season
right in here.

136
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,717
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

137
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:09,576
- We got some snacks here.
- Oh, my gosh.

138
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,790
Everyone is really cute.

139
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,326
For me, it's a little difficult
to focus sometimes,

140
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,229
because I'm just like, wow, mm.

141
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,298
And it's great, because
I'm the tallest of them,

142
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,566
so I just get to look down

143
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,736
at all the gorgeous little...
Little... little nuggets.

144
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,437
Come on, losers!

145
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,072
Ooh, girl!

146
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,442
She done already
done had herses!

147
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,912
Last time this happened,
it didn't go well.

148
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:40,016
My queens,
sometimes an early win

149
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,851
can make you soft and easy.

150
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,055
But we don't do nothin'
'round here soft and easy.

151
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,658
We like to do it hard and rough.

152
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,892
- Period.
- Word.

153
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,828
So make me proud, Mary,
and you can become

154
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,433
a Drag Race phenomenon-
non-non-non-non-non-non.

155
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:01,137
- Phenomenon!
- Phenomen-omenom-enon!

156
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,372
Hello, hello, hello!

157
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,976
- Whoo!
- She's a snack!

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,478
Welcome to RuPaul's Drag Race,

159
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,781
the emotional
rollercoaster edition.

160
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,318
Now, do you all feel
a little dizzy

161
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,586
after what we put you through?

162
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,087
- Of course.
- Yes.

163
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,591
If I gave you a little scare,
I'm sorry.

164
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,361
But sometimes the best way
to get where you are going

165
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,797
is a firm kick in the tuchus.

166
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:31,400
Now, in your past I'm sure
you've survived things

167
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:34,971
a whole lot crazier than
our lip sync for your life.

168
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,272
True.

169
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,540
And it's that drive
and determination

170
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,710
that can make you
a winner, baby.

171
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,745
Ladies, I know you are ready

172
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,880
for your first mini-challenge,
am I right?

173
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,083
- Let's do it!
- Okay.

174
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:50,886
So get ready to serve two
different looks on the runway

175
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:55,458
in a killer fashion show
we're calling Lady and the Vamp.

176
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,728
#DragRace.

177
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,330
I'm really excited,
because I am a look queen,

178
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,865
and this is what I do best.

179
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,968
When I walk out on the runway,
their jaws will drop.

180
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:09,705
Remember, top designers
and fashion editors

181
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,540
are watching this show,

182
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,843
so show us what you got.

183
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,112
I will see you on the runway.

184
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,613
Let's go.

185
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,881
Aah!

186
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,041
- I got it!
- Get the drag!

187
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,954
All right, y'all,

188
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,289
I'm about to do something
I've never done before:

189
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:28,291
paint a face in one hour.

190
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,626
Oh, Kahmora. Okay,
let me just say this.

191
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,827
Shut up!

192
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,396
Kahmora is notoriously known
in Chicago

193
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,699
for taking, like, maybe,
what, five, six hours?

194
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,700
Oh, my God, shut up!

195
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,801
Five or six hours?

196
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:41,170
I love my sister Kahmora
to death,

197
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,906
but it's this kind of joke
amongst the rest of our cast

198
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,341
whenever we're working
with Kahmora,

199
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,677
is that, oh,
our call time is 10:30?

200
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,779
Oh, she started getting ready
after lunch.

201
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,782
Girl, beauty can't be rushed,
but today it will have to.

202
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,784
Girl, listen, you are
a beautiful woman,

203
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,952
but it does not look like you're
wearing five hours of makeup.

204
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,421
- Exactly.
- It's not caked on.

205
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,989
I'm that good at blending, huh?

206
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,491
I like to just splat it on
and be done with it.

207
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,293
It's like a process for me,
you know?

208
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,162
It's a very spiritual
transformation.

209
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,230
I like to take my time.

210
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,432
Sis, we're on Drag Race.

211
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,057
It's not called Drag Walk.

212
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,304
I'm a little wary

213
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,039
to see what the other group's
gonna be like.

214
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,041
They've already got their noses
in the air a bit, I'm sure,

215
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,376
from winning that lip sync.

216
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,677
Ladies, promise me

217
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,612
that the winner's gonna be
from our group, okay?

218
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,081
- She's right here.
- Ooh!

219
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,716
I ain't mad at you!

220
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,075
I am.

221
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,723
Oh, my God,
I look so gross. Eew.

222
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:37,426
This is the biggest
struggle bus ever,

223
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,795
and I feel like
the hot mess express.

224
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,464
Oh, I'm doomed.

225
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,467
I'm just, like, girl,
get it together.

226
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,668
Okay. Fuck!

227
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,903
Aah! I'm freaking out.

228
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:48,938
I hear another "ugh."

229
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,773
Aah! Oh, my God. Fuck.

230
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,709
She's over there losing it.
She's just overwhelmed.

231
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,710
I'm scared, Denali.

232
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,878
You'll be okay, baby.

233
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,446
Don't get hung up on,
like, the small details.

234
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,514
Just keep going.

235
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,749
Oh, fuck.

236
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,417
We're on a strict time limit.

237
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,185
I mean, the bitch is stunning,

238
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,354
but if she can't
get ready in time,

239
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,914
I don't know if she's
gonna make it to the runway.

240
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,526
Oh, fuck.

241
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,352
- Oh, my.
- Jesus Christ.

242
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,965
Everybody set, we're rolling.

243
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,867
Here we go.

244
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,361
In five, four, three, two...

245
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,484
I look around.

246
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,919
All the other queens are poof.

247
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,721
They have left
for the main stage.

248
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,190
Like, man, this is
my second chance,

249
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,558
and I'm already screwing it up.

250
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,718
It's sinking in. I blew it.

251
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,371
Judges, stand by.
30 seconds to runway.

252
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:57,673
So it's time
for the mini-challenge,

253
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,008
and it is a fashion show,

254
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:00,810
and I am so fucking excited.

255
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,578
The theme is Lady and the Vamp.

256
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,914
So I hope
we're all ready for this.

257
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,616
Category is Lady.

258
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,419
Up first, Denali.

259
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,855
Lady Sings the Blues.

260
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,824
This look is classic Denali.

261
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,726
I love being
that ice queen girl,

262
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,595
so any shade of blue
is my color.

263
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,232
It is just a blue
dainty doll dress dream,

264
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:26,802
and I'm also in
fully rhinestoned blue pumps

265
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,671
on my dainty little feet.

266
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,673
She's got
a killer case of blue leg.

267
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,975
There's an ointment
that will clear that right up.

268
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,646
I wanted to give
a shoutout to my Alaskan roots

269
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,149
and state flower,
the forget-me-not.

270
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:43,886
So to be covered in this
blue, feminine forget-me-nots

271
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,955
made me feel my full fantasy.

272
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,257
So all this time,
Smurfette was a drag queen?

273
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,460
Joey Jay.

274
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,729
Don't you hate when
you miss a spot shaving?

275
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,531
I don't wear wigs very often,

276
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:58,434
so I'm giving some classic
Joey Jay buzz cut realness.

277
00:10:58,458 --> 00:10:59,902
I've got my shades on

278
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,238
because the sunlight
is just so bright,

279
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,974
but so am I.

280
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,176
I'm wearing a vest.

281
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,478
The boots go all the way
up to my thigh.

282
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,715
I'm out running errands,
my kids are off at daycare.

283
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,717
I'm feeling good.

284
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,085
Is she fur real?

285
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:19,355
I'll take one, and I'm
wearing it to bear week.

286
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,422
Rosé.

287
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,724
Not right now, thanks.
I'm working.

288
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:27,029
Oh, honey,
she is arty for the party.

289
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,264
Rosé's lady runway

290
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,000
is a Moschino-inspired
paper doll fantasy.

291
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,037
I'm serving bright colors,
lots of geometry.

292
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,541
This is a hand-painted dress
with a matching bag.

293
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,609
Those kidney-shaped sleeves

294
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,078
scream "I'm an organ donor."

295
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,613
I've donated an organ before.

296
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,781
- Have you?
- Yes.

297
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,316
I'm not usually a queen

298
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,285
who tends to be ladylike,

299
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:51,020
but, bitch, I feel like
a woman right now.

300
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,546
And my ass has a huge secret.

301
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:58,093
"Osé." Hmm. Who's Osé?

302
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,995
Oh!

303
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,030
She saw this in the store

304
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,698
and said, "Oh, it has
my name on it!"

305
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,469
Tamisha Iman.

306
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,372
- Ooh, ooh, I love harem pants.
- Mm-hmm.

307
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,076
My look is very
summertime by the pool.

308
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,613
I got on my lace flowing coat,
my very Joan Crawford look,

309
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,716
you know, with my Capri pants
and I'm jeweled,

310
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,851
because you ain't drag
if you ain't got no stones on.

311
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,887
I'm looking rich,
I'm looking expensive.

312
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,889
If they would have got in close,

313
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,692
they would have smelled
the Chanel that I was wearing.

314
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,160
Gorgeous.

315
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,562
This color
is called "dazzleberry."

316
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,397
I was thinking "dingleberry."

317
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,099
Tastiest kind of berry.

318
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,669
She is the fuchsia of drag.

319
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,173
Idica? Huh. Utica.

320
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:47,176
Balls to the wall.

321
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,078
Oh, my cat will love this look.

322
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,080
My dog will love this look.

323
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,815
So this is my lady fantasy,

324
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:56,418
and this is the most classic
Utica you can get.

325
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,420
Balls, balls, balls,
balls, ballsity-balls,

326
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,457
fresh out of the playpen
ball pit from McDonald's.

327
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:05,594
And I am living
my mod sixties fantasy.

328
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,698
It's about the goof,
the woof, and the aloof.

329
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,567
If I put a quarter in her slot,

330
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,168
do I get a gumball?

331
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,137
I don't know what
will come out of that slot.

332
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,506
Y'all, now that's a bubble butt.

333
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:28,508
Let's roll, please.

334
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,286
Kahmora Hall.

335
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,757
Ooh, girl,
Kahmora has all the tea.

336
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,759
I barely made it
on time to the runway,

337
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,662
but I have to stand tall
and don't show them any fear.

338
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,798
And so I am just smiling
and looking beautiful.

339
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,467
I am serving you Kate Middleton

340
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,170
going out to lunch
with the queen.

341
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,740
I am taking my time so
the judges can see this dress.

342
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,410
It's very fifties
Christian Dior.

343
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,578
I've got this
cute little low bun on,

344
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,348
with a matching fascinator.

345
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,849
I want them to have
a sip of this tea.

346
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:03,419
Smells like Earl... Earl Grey.

347
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,611
Earl Gay.

348
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,394
Category is V-A-M-P.

349
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,830
Vamp!

350
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,632
Snap out of it!

351
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:19,034
First up, Denali.

352
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,004
She is singed for the gods.

353
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,939
50 shades of cray.

354
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,374
For the vampy runway,

355
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,711
I'm giving you
Moschino fall 2016.

356
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,313
Jeremy Scott
did an entire runway

357
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,717
of women emerging
from a burned ballroom.

358
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:39,321
Somebody's drunk uncle spilled
his drink on the candelabra,

359
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,989
the whole place
went up in flames,

360
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:45,094
and I am emerging now,
but still looking fierce.

361
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,228
You know, I don't know
if you guys noticed,

362
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,262
but in a certain light,

363
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,964
you can sort of
see through her dress.

364
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,666
Just a little bit.

365
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,568
Joey Jay.

366
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,470
- Joey Jay!
- Joey Jay!

367
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,906
Yeah, honey, she just dropped
the kids off at the strip club.

368
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,509
I'm giving you Game of Thrones,

369
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,579
scale sleeve,
dragons are sleeping,

370
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,581
it's time to go out
with my little witches.

371
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:06,882
We're gonna kiki.

372
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,584
I'm giving you
a black silhouette,

373
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,053
and I've got these stupid,
ignorant earrings,

374
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,288
with chain and spikes on them.

375
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,691
I can't whip your ass, but I
look like I can fuck you up.

376
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,961
You got a backyard
for that swing, baby?

377
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,331
Yes, honey,
the dominatrix sleeps tonight.

378
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,999
Rosé.

379
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,202
Welcome to the main cage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

380
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,239
There are some looks
that you put on

381
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,208
and you just know that
nobody can tell you shit.

382
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,476
That's how I feel in this.

383
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,445
It's absolutely
fucking everything.

384
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,715
It is Alexander McQueen
inspired.

385
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,285
I feel like the high priestess
at a funeral

386
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,888
who's about to go out
and get a cocktail

387
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,457
by herself at 6 A.M.

388
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,725
I can never find
the switch on this lamp.

389
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,226
Yeah, I know.

390
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,396
Does anyone still wear
a lazy Susan?

391
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,967
Tamisha Iman.

392
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,037
All right, Miss Hairy J. Blige.

393
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,541
This is the hairway to heaven.

394
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,875
You wanted vamp,

395
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,344
I'm giving you the vampiest
of vamp: Elvira.

396
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,846
I took it to the next level,
though,

397
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,883
because in Atlanta, we like
weaves, we like long hair.

398
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,219
But if I'm gonna do
a hair costume,

399
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,987
I'm gonna do
a full hair costume.

400
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,623
So I'm rocking 84 inches
on this runway.

401
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,826
This is definitely the D-I-V-A.

402
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,928
I am totally
the diva of the night.

403
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,462
She's not just
the hair club president.

404
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,498
She's also a client.

405
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,266
You don't have to brush.
Slow down.

406
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,339
Okay, come on, Kahmora Hall,

407
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,309
giving us
Miss Sonia Rock-ay-elle.

408
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,011
Kahmora is serving you dark lady

409
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:45,013
on the prowl for her next meal.

410
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,782
I feel very sultry.

411
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,084
I got my wet blood orange hair,

412
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,486
I got my vintage
Mugler dress on,

413
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,222
with a Dracula collar top.

414
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,991
And at the waist,
I am sparkling with Swarovski.

415
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,026
Like, Kahmora loves
a good sparkle.

416
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,828
Who's ready for a bite of this?

417
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,196
Now, is that
a Cross-Your-Heart bra?

418
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,566
She's losing her
religion right before our eyes.

419
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,103
Utica.

420
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,039
Well, her balls
have finally dropped.

421
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,041
For this vamp catwalk,

422
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:16,612
I am bringing the attitude
of I own the night.

423
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:19,414
I am serving elastic fantastic

424
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:23,719
with this Edwardian feel
and this burgundy dream

425
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,554
as I creep down the runway.

426
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,689
I love to play
with the light and dark

427
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,558
within my fashions
and within myself.

428
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:33,395
This is a prime example
of what I do best.

429
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,998
Yay, now we'll get
all the channels.

430
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,372
Ru, wanna go to
the after-party with me?

431
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,998
Well, are you gonna
be wearing that?

432
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,069
Yeah.

433
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,247
Whoo!

434
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,582
- Whoo, mama.
- All right.

435
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,551
Mini-challenge, good.

436
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,386
- Check.
- We did it.

437
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,687
Now get me outta this geish!

438
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:00,889
We are back in the werkroom,

439
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,058
and I just feel, like,
a sense of relief.

440
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,227
I barely made it on time
for the runway,

441
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,596
but in the end,
I did feel really beautiful,

442
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,331
and I'm glad that
I was able to show the judges

443
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:11,099
that, hey, this is
what I'm bringing.

444
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,534
And that was just
the mini-challenge.

445
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,269
Like, that felt like a pretty
big fucking mini-challenge.

446
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,204
It felt like
a real challenge to me.

447
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,840
But now I feel like I'm here.
I have arrived.

448
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:19,908
We're here, bitch.
We're all here.

449
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,677
I feel like I was finally able

450
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,445
to walk in front of RuPaul,
like, feeling good.

451
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,280
- Comfortable.
- Feeling prepared.

452
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,749
Not just some, like, drag bus
that I was pushed in front of.

453
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,451
- Right.
- Not a drag bus.

454
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,153
I think a big catalyst for that

455
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,155
is that I feel like
I have sisters in y'all.

456
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,590
- Exactly.
- It's so nice.

457
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,491
I know we're competing,
obviously,

458
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,695
but I'm not, like...
I'm not so wound up by that.

459
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:40,963
- Right.
- Well, that's what I came for.

460
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,097
You came for sisterhood?

461
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,699
Then I'll take the crown, okay?

462
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,467
I've been in the business
a long time.

463
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,402
A lot of pageants under my belt.

464
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,837
How many? How many pageants
have you done?

465
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,339
Oh, my God, I've done over...

466
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:51,940
At least 200 pageants, and I...

467
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,408
You're fucking kidding.
200 pageants?

468
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,311
Yeah, I've won
at least about 95.

469
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,512
- Are you serious?
- 95?

470
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,814
Been doing it 30 years.

471
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,515
Tamisha, if you don't mind,
like, how old are you?

472
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,750
I'm 49.

473
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,452
- 49.
- Wow.

474
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,556
Oh, we got some prehistoric
ladies up in here.

475
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,657
Damn.

476
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,292
49 years young.

477
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,260
You must have had
a skin transplant, bitch.

478
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,361
Thank you.

479
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,662
That skin
does not look 49 years old.

480
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,697
You might cut into it
and find rings like a tree,

481
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,065
but the outside is nice.

482
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,735
Okay, how old are we? 25.

483
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,869
I'm 28.

484
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,238
- I'm 31.
- 28.

485
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,707
All of you are younger
than my biological kids.

486
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,942
That's crazy.

487
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,477
You have kids?
Like, biological kids?

488
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,511
Yeah, I have three.

489
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,213
You have kids?

490
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:33,382
- That's everything.
- Okay.

491
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,217
I cannot fucking believe

492
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:39,454
Tamisha also has literal
biological children.

493
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,156
Her pussy is literally on fire,

494
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,425
because several humans
have popped out of it, bitch.

495
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:46,695
Do we know how old
any of the other girls are?

496
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,230
I know they're not 49.

497
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,866
It's just crazy,

498
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,468
because everyone else
is so much younger than myself.

499
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,470
These are babies.
But guess what?

500
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:56,571
Age is just a number.

501
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,841
I haven't lasted
for 30 years for nothing.

502
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,967
I'm a bad B,
and you're gonna see it.

503
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:05,514
Hey, supermodels.

504
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,916
- Uh-oh!
- Hey, Ru!

505
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,686
Ladies, for your first
maxi-challenge,

506
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,855
you'll be performing
the song Phenomenon,

507
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,625
an original anthem

508
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,128
from the RuPaul's Drag Race
Live in Vegas soundtrack.

509
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,396
- Oh!
- Oh!

510
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,932
And this week, queens are wild

511
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:27,803
as each of you needs to write
your own original verse.

512
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,938
Okay? Move over, Britney Spears.

513
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,273
Okay.

514
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,543
Then you'll work together
to create choreography

515
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,479
that says, bitch,
I'm sickening, no?

516
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,483
This is the kind of shit
I do back in New York.

517
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,752
I am a singer, I am a dancer,

518
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:47,522
and there is a whole bonfire
under my ass

519
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,258
after almost being
sent home last week.

520
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,561
I have got to slay
this challenge.

521
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,963
Queens, this is your chance

522
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:59,067
to show the world
that you are a phenomenon.

523
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,068
- Hello.
- That's right.

524
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,537
Racers, start your engines,

525
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,906
and may the best drag queen win.

526
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,345
Are you guys, like,
singing or rapping?

527
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,379
I'm doing both.

528
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,914
- You're doing both?
- Both?

529
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,883
I'm just excited
to now be, like,

530
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,351
let me show you
what I can actually do.

531
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,286
We're all writing
our own verses,

532
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,589
and at this point,
there's a passion

533
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:23,492
that's ignited from losing
the first lip sync.

534
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,427
When I start
to get mad at myself

535
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,829
is when I push myself
even harder.

536
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,098
It's definitely something
that athletes do a lot.

537
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,601
So this is my redemption moment.

538
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,703
I'm gonna show
what I am capable of.

539
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,138
What are you doing, Rosé?

540
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,706
- I'm gonna sing.
- You're singing!

541
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,207
- She can sing.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

542
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,176
I feel like
I should use my chops

543
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,711
and put my musical foot forward.

544
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,812
Are you sure, though?

545
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:45,638
Do you think
that's a wise decision?

546
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,384
Yes, I do.

547
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,119
Utica, what you gonna do?

548
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,255
This farm girl's gonna rap.

549
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,590
- Shut up.
- Okay.

550
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:57,893
♪ Old McDonald had a farm ♪

551
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:01,062
I don't have a lot of experience
with writing lyrics.

552
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,364
This is my first time.

553
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:03,732
But I'm a weird queen,

554
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:07,169
and weird lyrics kinda
have to coincide with that.

555
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,871
I'm not a singer or a rapper,
but I'm gay.

556
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,907
So I'm just gonna take that
and, like, run with it.

557
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:15,744
I don't write music,
but I'm gay as fuck.

558
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,145
I'm gonna shit rainbows
and glitter,

559
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,915
and it's gonna be everything.

560
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,817
Okay, so we also have to
come up with choreo for this.

561
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,252
Is anybody not a dancer?

562
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,487
I am not a dancer.

563
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,688
I have, like, two left feet.

564
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,757
My experience
is mostly in modern dance.

565
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:29,958
- Word!
- Really?

566
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,059
So it's a lot of,
like, clean lines,

567
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,628
squishing the grapefruit,
praise the sun.

568
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,930
Open your pores
and run in circles.

569
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,431
Exactly.

570
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,533
You know, I'm a choreographer,
I'm a dancer.

571
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,303
But keep in mind these babies
are 20 years younger than me.

572
00:22:41,327 --> 00:22:42,971
And there's certain things
right now physically

573
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:45,640
I can't do
that I used to be able to do.

574
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:46,975
So I'll follow their lead.

575
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,610
Well, who's a dancer?
Raise your hand.

576
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:49,611
Who's a dancer?

577
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,313
This is, like, what I do
outside of drag

578
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,747
is I'm a choreographer.

579
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,949
Yeah, we've talked.

580
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,317
Like, we have
in experience choreographing.

581
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,185
Is anybody else, like,
choreographing before?

582
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,020
Yeah, I used to teach
ballroom for six years.

583
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,388
Okay, cool.

584
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,489
In terms of ensemble choreo,

585
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,657
we should definitely
keep it simple

586
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,792
so that we all look the most...

587
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,162
We can just take
the choreography from the chorus

588
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:10,365
and copy and paste it
for the next one.

589
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,001
We can copy/paste it, but,
like, switch up our formations.

590
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,135
Something that's really
important to me

591
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,303
when I choreograph

592
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,404
is just making sure
things grow and grow.

593
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,539
Yes.

594
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,575
Three of us are dancers
and choreographers.

595
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,078
It's me, Rosé, and Joey Jay.

596
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,513
But outside of drag, I am
a professional choreographer

597
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:27,415
for both dance
and figure skating.

598
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,485
So I really wanna
take this delegation role.

599
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,354
Six is a good number, too,
because even numbers

600
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:33,588
are a lot easier to work with.

601
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:36,558
Yeah, honestly, though,
on that stage, so is five.

602
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,094
I'd also love
to use the catwalk.

603
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,362
Where they can have
their moment on one side,

604
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,330
while the other five
are in a formation on the other.

605
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:48,027
I know what I'm capable of,
and so I am not backing down.

606
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,208
- All right.
- Okay, okay, okay.

607
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,743
- Let's go, let's go.
- Time to choreo.

608
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,544
Let's do this. It is now time

609
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,980
to figure out choreography
for our Phenomenon track.

610
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,882
I'm a professional
choreographer,

611
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,450
so I know I can take charge.

612
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,320
But I am a little nervous
about some of the other girls.

613
00:24:05,344 --> 00:24:06,655
When it comes to a group show,

614
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,857
if there's one bad egg,

615
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:10,525
it can bring
the whole team down.

616
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,461
Okay, divas, we got 60 minutes.

617
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,397
So you think we can kind of
take it from the top

618
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,198
and block
something simple there?

619
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:20,101
So it's gonna go
five, six, seven, eight.

620
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,202
We can all start to walk on...

621
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:22,737
Everyone feel comfortable
with right foot?

622
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,708
I definitely feel Denali
trying to take the lead,

623
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:29,277
but trust me,
if it's not feeling cute,

624
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,146
I'm gonna step in
and say something.

625
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,614
Five, six, seven, eight.

626
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,115
One. Perfect. That's great.

627
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,650
Are we gonna keep that speed?

628
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,086
One, two, three, four.

629
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,688
Well, let's milk that.

630
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,657
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

631
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,959
Can we do one, two,
three, four, five?

632
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,930
Girl, we have 60 minutes,
and I gotta get this done.

633
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,265
Unh! Let me do this.

634
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:53,568
What do you think about
not going on the first one?

635
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:56,738
So it could be, like,
one, two, three, four.

636
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:59,240
Why don't we just slo-mo that
five, six, seven, eight?

637
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,843
I see that,
but I want us to build

638
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,470
and not kind of slow down.

639
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:08,316
Rosé's like, "And
I think we should do this,

640
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,751
and what about this,"
and Denali's like,

641
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,353
"Okay, we gonna do this
and this and this."

642
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:12,520
And Joey's like,
"Well, hey, I'm here, too,

643
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,555
so we're gonna do
this, this, this."

644
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,256
They are in competition
right now.

645
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,092
I'm, like, no, bitches,
that's not gonna work.

646
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,027
You can't have
too many cooks in the kitchen.

647
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,662
You can't have
too many choreographers

648
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:21,663
on the dance floor.

649
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:24,265
Five, six, seven, eight,

650
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,834
and then hit the pose.

651
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,202
How many rows are there of us?
Could we ripple the head?

652
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,503
Should we do a half-circle?

653
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,838
Let's stay in a line.

654
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,905
No. You could go
in front of her,

655
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,140
because you're
so much, like, shorter.

656
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,975
And maybe it's like
a shhhhw pose.

657
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,177
Who do I look at?
Who do I listen to?

658
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:40,682
Five, six, quick now,
one, two, three, four,

659
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,218
five, six, seven, eight, pivot.

660
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:44,886
- Missed it.
- Does that make sense?

661
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,087
No.

662
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,022
Kahmora is blank-faced.

663
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,625
Kahmora is actually playing
ping-pong ball with her eyes.

664
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:52,527
She's...

665
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,129
Can you do the pivot again?

666
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,163
So it's like you're gonna step,

667
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,132
and you see someone
you don't like,

668
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:57,532
and you're like, oh, shit.

669
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,501
And then you're, like,
ball-change going the other way.

670
00:25:58,525 --> 00:26:00,535
Kahmora is really struggling.

671
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,237
She's not taking in
the choreography

672
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,371
as quickly as the rest of us,

673
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,274
and she's focusing on
the little details

674
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,543
when we need to be focusing
on the big picture.

675
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,212
Three, four, five, six, fast.

676
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,580
- One, two, three, four...
- Oh, I messed up already.

677
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,649
I messed up, I messed up!

678
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,984
Wait, I messed up.

679
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:19,020
Keep in mind we have someone
who's not a dancer.

680
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,555
So we have to keep that in mind.

681
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,090
- Right, no, no, no, yeah.
- I don't wanna confuse her.

682
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,392
Can we lift her?

683
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,329
Kahmora is not a dancer,
but she's stunning.

684
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,932
So I thought let's
not give her choreography.

685
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,233
Let's pick the bitch up.

686
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,092
She don't gotta do anything.

687
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,404
All you have to do

688
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,705
is really tense your armpits.

689
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,140
Five, six, seven, eight.

690
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,141
I'm so tall!

691
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,543
Oh, my God, you're so light.

692
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:45,680
So then for mine, I wanna try,
like, a trick thingy.

693
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,748
I'll take your hand.

694
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,383
I wanna, like...

695
00:26:48,407 --> 00:26:52,921
like, spin like that,
and then I can just end.

696
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,089
Oh, bitch,
this is Cirque du Soleil.

697
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,692
We all over the place. Okay.

698
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,795
I'm in the daycare,
and the children are excited.

699
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,465
I don't know
who gave them this candy.

700
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:05,667
On one. One.

701
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,335
Let's all do the right.

702
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,603
- Or I could do the left, yeah.
- That would look cool,

703
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,737
to do one and one,
and we're both out here.

704
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,738
Are we splitting?
No, you're behind.

705
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,173
You guys, maybe you can.

706
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,608
I think she could be behind.

707
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,876
This ain't gonna work.

708
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,779
When you're trying
to choreograph,

709
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,747
you have to stay focused
and get the job done.

710
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:23,184
All of a sudden
it's 10 minutes left,

711
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,186
and it's not getting done.

712
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,388
From right where we are,
we should just point.

713
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,923
Boom, from Russia to L.A.

714
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:31,059
Why don't we all point
in a different direction?

715
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,695
With, like, different levels?
Like, boom, Russia.

716
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:36,064
Oh, should I just,
like, stay down?

717
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,366
From Russia to...
Just walk and count.

718
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,367
Oh, yeah, we could just march.

719
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,969
Switch, you go over there.

720
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,904
Y'all start first
and we come second.

721
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,273
Five, six, seven, eight.

722
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,341
From Russia.

723
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:47,575
You should be going with her.

724
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,377
- You're gonna switch with me.
- Okay, I got it.

725
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,879
This is a good idea.
Listen to her.

726
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:54,782
Mama Tamisha, she is, like,
okay, let the pro come in,

727
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:55,984
and let me tell you
what needs to be done.

728
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,452
Five, six, ready, go.

729
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,454
From the... nuh-uh-uh. We're next.

730
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,689
- We're after that, okay?
- I'm living for it.

731
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,258
One more time, y'all. Ready, go.

732
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,159
From Russia to UK.

733
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,295
Sashay, shantay, you stay.

734
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,998
Why don't we just be,
like, sashay, yeah?

735
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,599
- Yeah.
- Sashay, shantay, you stay.

736
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,269
Listen, all we need to do
is "stay" together.

737
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,870
We got your line now.

738
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,972
One accord,
let's get on one accord.

739
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,674
- Okay.
- And in the end,

740
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,310
how about we walk in the circle
and tighten it

741
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,679
and come in to basically,
like a kind of windmill blob,

742
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,214
with, like, arms out.

743
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,684
Lord, I'm hoping
we pull this off.

744
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,252
But the way we're looking
right now,

745
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,679
I'm worried like hell
we all going home.

746
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:41,763
- Ooh-ee!
- All right, let's do it.

747
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,097
Today we are going
to be getting judged

748
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,567
on our dancing,
group-ass challenge

749
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:47,969
to RuPaul's song Phenomenon.

750
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,405
And, honey, I'm feeling
really good about this.

751
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,707
#Blessed.

752
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,143
I think this routine
is so strong.

753
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,377
They're gonna probably think
the other group

754
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,212
is the ones that went home
after the fact.

755
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,614
- Honestly.
- I agree.

756
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:00,949
I don't know what
the other girls did,

757
00:29:00,973 --> 00:29:02,050
but I feel like ours
is real strong.

758
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:04,419
We were so fun
when working together.

759
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:07,446
We worked together, and we all,
you know, used our voices.

760
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,924
Are y'all serious?

761
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,193
I think sometimes

762
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,730
your confidence
can exceed your abilities.

763
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,199
On one hand, I'm appreciative
to see that they are hungry.

764
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:21,202
On the other hand, a bitch
is still scared to unpack.

765
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,362
Sorry. I don't know
how this is gonna go.

766
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,175
I'm already late.

767
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,176
- Kahmora.
- Yes, ma'am.

768
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,777
Make sure you breathe, baby.

769
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,179
- I know.
- Breathe.

770
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,847
There was
a lot going on yesterday,

771
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,217
just from struggling
to get to the runway on time.

772
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,854
And then, like, not being,
like, the dancer of the group,

773
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,823
I felt, like, a lot of pressure.

774
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,792
And I don't wanna let myself,
you girls, and the judges down.

775
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,060
Baby, guess what? We with you.

776
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,228
We understand.

777
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,763
Kahmora, you really impress me.

778
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:49,864
You're gonna slay.

779
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,633
Like, the support
you girls have given me

780
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,934
has been, like, amazing.

781
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,937
I wish I had this kind of
same support back home.

782
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,338
Like, don't get me wrong.

783
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,440
Like, my boyfriend does support
me in everything that I do.

784
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,508
But sometimes, like,
when I do come back

785
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:01,643
after, like, the gig,

786
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,212
like, sometimes
you do feel alone, you know?

787
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,347
I know my boyfriend
wouldn't want to date,

788
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,782
like, a full-time drag queen.

789
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,550
And so I think that's why
I kind of held myself back

790
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,420
in terms of first doing drag,
like, full-time.

791
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:15,223
I only do drag, like,
maybe once or twice a month.

792
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,824
How long have y'all
been together?

793
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,859
Eight years.

794
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:18,926
Holy shit, girl, word.

795
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,828
In gay years, that's a lifetime.

796
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:24,132
I try to keep,
like, my drag life

797
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,200
separate from,
like, our home life.

798
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,903
Like, whenever I do drag, I try
to do it, like, away from him.

799
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,506
I keep everything in,
like, my own storage unit.

800
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,875
Like, whenever I had
downtime at work,

801
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,110
I was always working on looks,

802
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,213
because I knew that my boyfriend
didn't wanna be around drag.

803
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,016
Sometimes I do feel like I'm
living, like, a double life.

804
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,852
It gets me, like, emotional.

805
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:48,990
Because I really wanna, like,
prove to him that I can do this.

806
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,124
- Mm-hmm.
- You can.

807
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,693
- You're here.
- You're gonna kick butt.

808
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,027
It's, like, you're sickening.

809
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,329
God, I just started
my makeup, too.

810
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,597
I just feel like my whole life

811
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,232
I've always been hiding,
like, a part of myself,

812
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:01,502
and minimizing my drag career
for others

813
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,504
has become, like, a hurdle

814
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,039
for me to get over
in this competition.

815
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:07,575
I just don't wanna let
anyone down again today,

816
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,676
so I'm just trying to, like...

817
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,011
Look, baby,
at the end of the day,

818
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,412
you're in a competition.

819
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,347
- Right.
- Don't let yourself down.

820
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,816
Just gotta worry about hottie.

821
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,150
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

822
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,253
Tamisha's definitely
the mother of the group.

823
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,022
It's just nice
to have that, like,

824
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,593
mature spirit there with you,
and she is very comforting.

825
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,929
You're gonna make mistakes.
That's what makes you great.

826
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,597
We made a mistake,
and look where we are.

827
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,165
We're still here fighting.

828
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,869
My kids know that I have moments
when I'm good,

829
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,738
and I have moments
when I'm okay.

830
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,806
But at the end of the day,
I don't give up on me.

831
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,608
Right.

832
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,143
So I know you said you have,
like, biological children,

833
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,644
but, like, do you have
any drag kids?

834
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,682
Well, I started my dynasty,
the House of Iman.

835
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:48,916
Yes.

836
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,419
It actually started
when I started years ago.

837
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,588
All of my kids that
are in the pageant realm

838
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,089
are all national title holders.

839
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,124
Bitch!

840
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,692
But a lot of my babies
have passed on.

841
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,128
But we never let
their memories fade.

842
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:03,431
One of my daughters,
she has this famous video.

843
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,032
She's performing as Super Woman.

844
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,701
Wait, stop it!

845
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,902
Tandi Iman Dupree!

846
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,170
- That's your daughter?
- Yes.

847
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:11,205
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, Tandi's my daughter.

848
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,074
I'm so shook right now.

849
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:15,877
Tandi is the one that made
the lasting impression.

850
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,311
So at the end of the day,

851
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,981
if you see my legendary
daughter, then guess what?

852
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:22,316
You know what
Iman's drag is about.

853
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,287
She was very soft-spoken,
like, "Mama, I got an idea."

854
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,523
She was, like,
"I wanna fall out the ceiling."

855
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,959
So we orchestrated how she could
do it without hurting herself.

856
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,394
I don't know how she didn't,

857
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,430
because that's probably
the biggest drop I've ever seen.

858
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,865
My kids are amazing.

859
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,501
And I just wanted to show them,
you know, at the end of the day,

860
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,536
I'm still fighting
the good fight.

861
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,603
And if I can do it,

862
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,604
regardless
of what you go through,

863
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,605
you can do it.

864
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:45,807
You've shown me that, baby.

865
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,141
Oh, my God, absolutely.

866
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,810
And I'm not
your daughter, you know?

867
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:50,611
You're my sister, though,
and I appreciate that.

868
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,947
Yes, I am your sister. Forever.

869
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,981
Forever.

870
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:55,416
- Forever-ever?
- Forever-ever-ever.

871
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,517
Forever?

872
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,119
Yeah, phenomenom-enom-enon.

873
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,222
The sisterhood and the friends
that I'm making here,

874
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,857
it's so lovely.

875
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,126
But I did not come here
to make friends.

876
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:10,164
I devoted the time onstage
to the group.

877
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,699
But now it's time
to focus on me.

878
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,334
I think there's gonna be
a lot of that,

879
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:14,669
cultivating a group sensation,

880
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,305
and then figuring out
how to be the best one.

881
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,594
♪ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ♪

882
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,864
♪ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ♪

883
00:33:42,888 --> 00:33:45,933
And what?

884
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,970
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

885
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,271
Michelle Visage.

886
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:53,341
Now, did you know that drag
is all over the world?

887
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,609
And luckily, Ru,

888
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,844
there's an ointment for that.

889
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,648
And the hilarious Ross Mathews.

890
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,951
Now, do you consider yourself
a phenomenon?

891
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:05,486
Does fen-phen count?

892
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,222
Yes, it does.

893
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,323
Then, yes, thank you.

894
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,225
She's part of the family now.

895
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:12,760
Welcome back, Nicole Byer.

896
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,463
Oh, Ru, there's
no place like home.

897
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,032
I tried for days and days
to make my way back,

898
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,100
and then your producers
were like,

899
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:20,368
"Yeah, bitch, come on back."

900
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,537
You are always welcome.

901
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,538
Oh, thank you.

902
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,140

903
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,241

00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,643

we challenged our queens

906
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,914
singing and dancing

907
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:37,118
to the Drag Race Live anthem,
Phenomenon.

908
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:42,047
Racers, start your engines,
and may the best drag queen win.

909
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,762

We're Here, We're Sheer.
Get Used To It.

990
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,348
First up, Denali.

991
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,049
It's like
a Georgia O'Keeffe fantasy.

992
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,485
I think you mean
Georgia O'Queef.

993
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,355
I'm serving you

994
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,924
high-fashion sheerness
and queerness.

995
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,193
Lavender on the body,

996
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,362
but black detailing
in the hair, earrings, shoes,

997
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,863
just for some contrast.

998
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,332
This look is inspired by
one of my favorite designers,

999
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,734
Iris van Herpen.

1000
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:49,136
She does a lot of cool,
futuristic-type things.

1001
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,071
I feel like
a breath of fresh air

1002
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,640
and the woman of the future.

1003
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:53,641
She looks like Nina Hagen.

1004
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,242
Nina Haagen-Dazs.

1005
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,578
There are
my anal beads: in her hair!

1006
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:00,748
Joey Jay.

1007
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:01,916
Joey Jay.

1008
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,817
Fringe benefits, I see.

1009
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,985
I wanted to really show

1010
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,087
the Joey Jay
edgy side of things.

1011
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,557
I've got my headband on.
No wig. Who dis?

1012
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm giving you, like,
Sia meets flapper

1013
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:15,362
meets Prohibition ass shit.

1014
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,965
Like, this is the sequined
poncho that you can't have.

1015
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,900
It's mine.
I'm untouchable, girl.

1016
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,202
It was easy. I just YouTubed

1017
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,837
"what to do with half
a Liza Minnelli costume."

1018
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,275
That reminds me.
I need to get a new Swiffer.

1019
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,612
Kahmora Hall.

1020
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:34,682
Kahmora Hall starring in Roots.

1021
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,751
My look is a mix

1022
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,287
between Cher at the Met Gala,

1023
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,989
that iconic look
that Bob Mackie did,

1024
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,425
meets a little bit
of Britney Spears' Toxic.

1025
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,794
This is classic Kahmora Hall:

1026
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:50,097
big hair, I'm wearing these
big-ass hubcaps on my ears,

1027
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,465
a lot of rhinestones.

1028
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,534
I wanna look so expensive

1029
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,502
that they go broke
just looking at me.

1030
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,704
Michelle,
you have your glasses on.

1031
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:57,805
Is she wearing earrings?

1032
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,275
I think I saw this
on Sonny and Sheer.

1033
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:04,945
Rosé.

1034
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,980
Finally, something to wear

1035
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,982
if you have fat wrists.

1036
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,686
This look speaks to
what Rosé does on the regular.

1037
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,755
Baby, my legs
are all the way out.

1038
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,190
I've got my baby pink hair,

1039
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,425
which is a signature
option for Rosé.

1040
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,561
And I'm playing with
a really fun silhouette.

1041
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:24,498
I'm meeting flowing fabric
with hand-dyed plastic.

1042
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:28,669
I am the only plastic
bubblegum princess

1043
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:32,273
complete with cotton candy,
billowing sleeves.

1044
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,841
I feel cute as a button
in this look.

1045
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,644
Oh, it's like
a gay loofah fantasy.

1046
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:37,845
Loofah? I hardly know ya.

1047
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,116
Tamisha Iman.

1048
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,885
Oh, the legend ball.

1049
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,087
Sheerly you could see a diva.

1050
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,255
You asked for sheer,

1051
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,590
I'm giving you
just what you asked for,

1052
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,025
but with glamour.

1053
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,761
The gown is encrusted
with glitter dots all over,

1054
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,462
so it's sparkling
from head to toe.

1055
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,630
I added a little drama

1056
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,333
on the front part
with the bustle.

1057
00:40:59,357 --> 00:41:02,169
The spotlight hits me
just right, as it always does,

1058
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,838
and I'm walking into
the Golden Globe,

1059
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:07,408
and I'm ready to accept
the award. Thank you.

1060
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,410
Ugh, I have no jokes.
This is stunning.

1061
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:12,079
It's a cross
between Diahann Carroll

1062
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,180
and Lola Falana.

1063
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,315
Mm.

1064
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,183
Sheer brilliance.

1065
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,284
Utica.

1066
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,787
Guys, this makes me wanna scarf.

1067
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,988
I literally was gonna say that.

1068
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:24,391
I am flowing down this runway

1069
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,428
in this watercolor eleganza.

1070
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:31,298
I am giving you
this Stevie Nicks nod,

1071
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,167
paying homage
to my beautiful mother,

1072
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,735
who loves Fleetwood Mac,

1073
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,870
and I am just feeling beautiful

1074
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:39,206
and ready to cast a spell.

1075
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,708
Very Sleevy Nicks.

1076
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,409
Did you say "Sleevy Nicks?"

1077
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,544
Yeah. Very Sleevy Nicks.

1078
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,104
It's a landslide.

1079
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,115
Welcome, queens.

1080
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,541
It's time for
the judges' critiques.

1081
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,521
Starting with Denali.

1082
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,890
So we're gonna start
with your fashion.

1083
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,927
You had ladykins,
and you had the vamp.

1084
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:01,829
Ladykins, I liked the idea
because it almost

1085
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,664
was a bit of a nod
to your ice skating.

1086
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,966
I like how you paired
the yellow hair with the blue,

1087
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,202
and I liked how you
brought it down there.

1088
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,437
And then your vamp look
is so different.

1089
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,605
If you didn't have
those dimples,

1090
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,574
I would have been, like,
is this the same girl?

1091
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,175
You really are showing us

1092
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,912
that you are willing to express
yourself in different ways here.

1093
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,114
Keeps us interested.

1094
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,182
Tonight in your performance,

1095
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,351
I couldn't take my eyes
off of you.

1096
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,554
Your kicks are beautiful,
your splits are beautiful.

1097
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,524
You have that gift that
you worked really hard for.

1098
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,525
Very that.

1099
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,293
And it's really amazing
to watch.

1100
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,462
It's about time somebody rhymed
"triple lutz" with "sluts."

1101
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,532
I was, like, ooh,
I'm a whore, too.

1102
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,834
This is a friend. An ally.

1103
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,171
Up next, Joey Jay.

1104
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,806
In the flesh.

1105
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,608
This is my favorite look
I've ever seen you in tonight.

1106
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,243
Thank you.

1107
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,577
I think it's so beautiful,
I think it's elevated,

1108
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,746
I think it's fun, I think...
It's really stunning.

1109
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,515
Ugh, I love it so much,

1110
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,116
I just wanna, like,
hang it up in a door.

1111
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,785
I love it. It's cute.

1112
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:58,952
I think you're cute.

1113
00:42:58,976 --> 00:42:59,987
What a treat. I love it.

1114
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,088
Oh!

1115
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,290
You're actually
really exciting to watch.

1116
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:04,691
You can tell that
you're a performer.

1117
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,461
In your lyrics tonight,
you told me

1118
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:09,296
that you don't wear wigs,
and to take a seat and learn.

1119
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,398
Why?

1120
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,567
I know a lot of people do drag

1121
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,270
and they love
having that alter ego.

1122
00:43:16,294 --> 00:43:19,006
But when I look in the mirror
and I do wear a wig,

1123
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,275
I don't necessarily
quite see myself.

1124
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,278
Right now, I feel like Joey,
I feel like myself.

1125
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:26,747
The first time I saw you
without a wig,

1126
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,415
I thought, oh, I love that.

1127
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,517
I think like Ongina.
It's iconic.

1128
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,119
The second time I saw you
without a wig,

1129
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,921
I thought, oh,
she did that again.

1130
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,924
And the third time in a row,
I thought, really?

1131
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,193
And then the fourth time,
now it's something.

1132
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:42,796
I want you to do drag
however you do it.

1133
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,666
Just make sure it's unique
and make sure it's gorgeous.

1134
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,934
I love this hair.

1135
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,335
I don't wanna change it.

1136
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,671
But I definitely
would love to see versatility.

1137
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,539
- Oh, get ready, sis.
- Good, bring it on.

1138
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,175
Up next, Kahmora Hall.

1139
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,745
Kahmora Hall, the strongest
earlobes in the business.

1140
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:01,748
You look rich.

1141
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,418
I would rob you in a heartbeat.

1142
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:06,620
I would take everything
off of you.

1143
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,755
You are beautiful.

1144
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,991
You have impeccable taste.

1145
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,594
Your ladykins look
was so proper.

1146
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:16,029
That black velvet
was just stunning.

1147
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,130
But...

1148
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,532
Always a big "but."

1149
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,036
Did you ever see that movie
Mannequin?

1150
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,769
Kim Cattrall,
she was the mannequin.

1151
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:25,606
She was beautiful,
and she would come to life

1152
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,374
when Andrew McCarthy
would show up.

1153
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,576
You need to come to life.

1154
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,014
What I'm noticing
is that you love your outfits,

1155
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,083
and I love that about you.

1156
00:44:36,107 --> 00:44:38,719
When I grew up, I would save
every freaking penny

1157
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,821
to buy the sluttiest dresses
I could find

1158
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,022
at Merry-Go-Round

1159
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,192
in the Woodbridge Center Mall
in New Jersey.

1160
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:47,027
This is what I fear
for you, Kahmora.

1161
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,830
Sometimes, I feel like
there's just a walking outfit

1162
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:52,199
devoid of personality.

1163
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:53,500
You looked lost.

1164
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,936
I was like, "Should I tell her
she's performing?"

1165
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,505
But that being said,

1166
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,340
if you're not a dancer,
lean into that.

1167
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,043
Like, if you are nervous,
put it into your moves,

1168
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,978
because then you can just
turn your nerves into comedy.

1169
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,680
And according to your lyrics,

1170
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,950
you're the most glamorous
in this race.

1171
00:45:09,974 --> 00:45:12,452
Take a look around, honey.
You've got some competition.

1172
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:13,854
Where?

1173
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,725
I think you've got
a personality. Look at you.

1174
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,394
I do, I promise, I swear.

1175
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:22,796
Do you and do you
the way you would wanna do you.

1176
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,732
Understood.

1177
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,367
Up next, Rosé.

1178
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,102
Mmm, doesn't that
sound delicious?

1179
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,271
Let's talk about your looks.

1180
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:34,775
Your ladykins look
was so pop-art fun,

1181
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,377
and I love that
you branded yourself.

1182
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,947
This look tonight I think
is really fun and draggy.

1183
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:42,983
I don't... I think it's, um...

1184
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:44,551
Oh, I don't wanna say
the word "crafty,"

1185
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,820
'cause I got dragged in the mud
for that last season.

1186
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:49,489
But I think it's really draggy

1187
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,558
and would work well
in, like, a club.

1188
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,859
I love this look.

1189
00:45:52,883 --> 00:45:54,161
I think you look stunning.

1190
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:55,262
It's not crafty!

1191
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,263
Understood.

1192
00:45:56,287 --> 00:45:57,731
If there wasn't Plexiglas here,

1193
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,099
I'd lean over and say it louder.

1194
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:02,903
Tonight your performance was
where you really won me over.

1195
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,105
You command
all of the attention.

1196
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,774
You have stage presence,
you can dance, you can move.

1197
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:09,610
Your voice is beautiful.

1198
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:11,845
You're one of those, you know,
queens that I would go to watch,

1199
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,680
and, oh, I'm just gonna
sit back and relax,

1200
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,549
because I know she's got it.

1201
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,217
I think you did
a really good job tonight.

1202
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:18,585
Thanks.

1203
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,655
All right, she looks like
one of the Supremes up here.

1204
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:27,060
Tamisha Iman, I love this dress.

1205
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,228
Thank you.

1206
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:30,197
It is one of the most
beautiful dresses

1207
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:31,798
that has ever graced this stage.

1208
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,133
Oh, thank you.

1209
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,735
Did you make this yourself?

1210
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,304
- I make all my garments.
- Oh, my goodness.

1211
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,806
I cannot believe
you make these yourself.

1212
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,041
One day
you're gonna have a dress

1213
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,509
on the Oscars red carpet.

1214
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,244
Oh, I would love that.

1215
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,380
You've really honed
the craft of drag.

1216
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,148
This dress...

1217
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,384
I want to rip it off of you.

1218
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,053
But the only thing it would fit
would be, like, my neck,

1219
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:55,188
and it wouldn't be
a good look out in public.

1220
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,457
Stunning.

1221
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,925
Let's talk about
the fashion show.

1222
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,327
I loved both of them.

1223
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,995
That ladykins color,

1224
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,630
that raspberry
with that harem jumpsuit,

1225
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,299
and that rich-looking robe
over it

1226
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,168
was just beautiful and classy.

1227
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,469
Thank you so much.

1228
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,306
In your performance,
you're the most seasoned one,

1229
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,208
and I felt a little
low-key from you.

1230
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,812
I need you to make it bigger.

1231
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,416
Because I know you come from
a long line of performers.

1232
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,687
You have a very legendary
drag daughter.

1233
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:28,388
My baby girl, Tandi Iman.

1234
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:31,992
If she was still alive,
she would be one of your girls,

1235
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:34,628
because she was
a phenomenal entertainer.

1236
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:35,629
I don't know
if you've seen the video...

1237
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:38,098
Oh, no, we've all seen the video

1238
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,367
of her dropping
from the ceiling, yes.

1239
00:47:40,391 --> 00:47:41,802
Oh, yes.

1240
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,904
She was a true entertainer.

1241
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:46,306
Show these girls
what it's about, Tamisha.

1242
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,508
Because when I see you here
tonight on this runway,

1243
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:52,145
bitch, I cannot get
my eyes off of you.

1244
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,449
So I'm gonna beg of you,
don't go small.

1245
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,984
Let us know who Tamisha Iman is.

1246
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,453
Okay.

1247
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:04,458
Up next, Syracuse,
Schenectady, Utica.

1248
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,526
What I like about you, Utica,

1249
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,731
is you are a queen that marches
to the beat of her own drum.

1250
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,833
The ladykins look is something

1251
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:15,202
that Lady Bunny
would have worn as a toddler.

1252
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,505
And then you came out
in your vamp look,

1253
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,875
which was just as odd
and unique.

1254
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,945
Your performance look
was also one of a kind.

1255
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,079
You know how you drop acid

1256
00:48:26,103 --> 00:48:27,414
and you're like,
"What the fuck is that?"

1257
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,449
That's you, and I like that.

1258
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,585
They won't air that.

1259
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:35,722
Your lyrics
talk about your savior.

1260
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,757
Are you religious?

1261
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,592
I am a Seventh-Day Adventist.

1262
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,227
Okay.

1263
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,261
And I'm definitely, like,

1264
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,396
a bring-your-own-god
type of human,

1265
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,234
so, like, no pressure,
but Jesus is great.

1266
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,469
Whoo!

1267
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,739
This winter, RuPaul's
Drag Race moves to TBN.

1268
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:57,477
Watching you tonight
in your performance,

1269
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,513
I think this is kind of
who Utica is,

1270
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:04,251
quirky, weird, different,
and letting the spirit move her.

1271
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,619
Just make sure
it all makes sense

1272
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:08,688
and it's all together
where it should be.

1273
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:12,459
There's something about queens
who are one of a kind.

1274
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,484
Stay true to you.

1275
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,062
Amen.

1276
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:17,097
Thank you, Utica.

1277
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,765
Thank you, RuPaul.

1278
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,201
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1279
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:23,904
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1280
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,464
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1281
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,178
All right, now,
just between us phenoms,

1282
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,612
whaddaya think?

1283
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,414
Let's start with Denali.

1284
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,783
The thing with Denali
that surprised me

1285
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,919
was having the ice skating,
I knew she'd be able to perform,

1286
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,587
but I didn't know if she could
bring it to the heels

1287
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:42,055
instead of the blades.

1288
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,991
And it was really, really fun
to watch her onstage tonight.

1289
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,460
Denali's performance was joyful,

1290
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:50,063
and I felt happier
after watching her.

1291
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:52,065
I agree. Denali
has the charisma,

1292
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,302
and she was spittin'
those words in her song.

1293
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,070
Denali's somebody to watch.

1294
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,572
Joey Jay.

1295
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,841
- Joey Jay.
- Joey Jay.

1296
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:03,543
If you line up the four looks,
it's the same look.

1297
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,811
It's almost like when you
order a pizza without cheese.

1298
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,213
You're like, okay,

1299
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:08,215
if you're hanging out with
your vegan friend, this is fine.

1300
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,749
But I don't want that every day.

1301
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,518
Wait a minute. They make pizza
without cheese?

1302
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,220
I know. I was shocked, too.

1303
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:15,121
- What's the point?
- I know, right?

1304
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:17,457
Put anchovies on the pizza,
Joey Jay!

1305
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,963
Where Joey Jay comes to life
is on the stage performing.

1306
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:25,165
What a phenomenal dancer,

1307
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,466
but I don't think
she really came through

1308
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,368
with the lyrics
in the performance.

1309
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,836
I just worry about redundancy.

1310
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,340
But Joey said that she's got
some wigs in her arsenal

1311
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,507
that she's ready to pull out.

1312
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,610
I've got something else
in my arsenal.

1313
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:38,712
I've heard.

1314
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:40,380
Kahmora Hall.

1315
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,149
Kahmora knows fashion,
and according to her lyrics,

1316
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,753
that's kind of all
she cares about, is fashion.

1317
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:49,723
She is so pretty, but her
performance reminded me

1318
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:52,125
of when I go to the
grocery store without a list,

1319
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:56,696
and you're just, like,
looking around kind of lost.

1320
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,797
Totally.

1321
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,466
SpaghettiOs? I would never.

1322
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:02,235
And then you have SpaghettiOs
in your basket, you know?

1323
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,271
She looks great
at the grocery store,

1324
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:08,642
but she needs to put
some milk, some bread,

1325
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:13,213
some eggs,
and butter on that list.

1326
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,181
Kahmora looked unbelievable
tonight.

1327
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:16,983
That dress is gorgeous.

1328
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,019
But that dress would look good
on a wire hanger.

1329
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:20,387
And you know what they say.

1330
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,589
No more wire hangers!

1331
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,524
Yeah, and you can't show up

1332
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:25,525
and be a wire hanger
in this competition, right?

1333
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,626
That's right.

1334
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,029
She's got the taste level
to be here,

1335
00:51:29,053 --> 00:51:30,697
but now she's gotta
entertain us.

1336
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:32,933
There's always time for Rosé.

1337
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:34,567
Rosé came here to play.

1338
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,136
Talk about a beautiful voice.

1339
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,372
Rosé was truly
just captivating to watch,

1340
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,242
and I think really
elevated her lyrics.

1341
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,444
I thought tonight
she looked fantastic.

1342
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:46,212
I know, Ross,
you think it was crafty.

1343
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,548
I wanna be very clear.
It's not an insult.

1344
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:49,683
It's just, you know,

1345
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:51,017
you're standing next to
Kahmora and Tamisha,

1346
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,686
and, yeah, compared to that,

1347
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,521
it does look like
a toddler made it.

1348
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,256
I see a drag queen

1349
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,858
that kind of expresses herself
through what she's wearing,

1350
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,226
and almost like her outfits

1351
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,962
will tell us
what she's gonna give us.

1352
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:03,663
- Mm-hmm.
- And I love queens like that.

1353
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,031
She's an incredible queen.

1354
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,501
I like her, and I'm truly
excited to see her blossom.

1355
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:10,136
Tamisha Iman.

1356
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,540
Oh, that dress truly
was so beautiful.

1357
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,976
But I want a performance
like that dress.

1358
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,744
I'm excited to see
what she's gonna do

1359
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:20,146
when she unleashes the beast.

1360
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,514
Because we know it's there.

1361
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,383
Bitch, take your moment.

1362
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:25,118
She's gotta learn that and
she's gotta learn it quickly,

1363
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,319
because we're looking
for the Beyoncé.

1364
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,855
We're looking for
the Diana Ross, you know?

1365
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,490
We're looking for the star here.

1366
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,359
It's weird you said Beyoncé
and Diana Ross.

1367
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,426
You didn't say Michelle Visage.

1368
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:35,495
Hold on, say it again.
Michelle what?

1369
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,666
Hey, Siri?

1370
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,337
Utica.

1371
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,472
What I really enjoyed

1372
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,174
was the complete opposite
in her vamps.

1373
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,943
Like, she went all the way dark.

1374
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:51,544
That's some dark web shit

1375
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,880
that she did in the vamps look,

1376
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:56,816
which is so ironic,
because she's so religious.

1377
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,685
She looked like a doll
that I would pick up

1378
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,353
and go, "I don't know,
it's a little scary,

1379
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:01,721
but I think I'll play with it."

1380
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:04,157
And then in her performance,

1381
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,893
I thought she was
really fun to watch.

1382
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,895
And then tonight on the runway,
I didn't love it.

1383
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,399
It was kind of simple
when you look down the line.

1384
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:16,236
It was very do-it-yourself
Alexander McQueen,

1385
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,272
but she makes everything work
because of her quirkiness.

1386
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,975
She reminds me
of some of my favorites:

1387
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:24,978
Thorgy Thor, Yvie Oddly,
Crystal Methyd.

1388
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,579
When I first saw her,
I almost dismissed her

1389
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,748
because she was so out there.

1390
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,318
But upon closer look, you know,
she might have the goods.

1391
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,678
Silence! I've made my decision.

1392
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,548
Bring back my girls.

1393
00:53:38,482 --> 00:53:39,783
Welcome back, ladies.

1394
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,463
Now, based on your performances
in the fashion show

1395
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,099
and on the main stage,

1396
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:47,891
I've made some decisions.

1397
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:53,130
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1398
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:58,302
Denali.

1399
00:54:00,437 --> 00:54:02,906
Rosé.

1400
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:08,321
Con-drag-ulations. You're
the top two queens of the week.

1401
00:54:10,948 --> 00:54:12,992
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1402
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,028
Oh, my God.

1403
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,522
The rest of you,
I'm sorry, my dears.

1404
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,569
You...

1405
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,727
are safe.

1406
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,898
I did it. I'm not going home,
not going home!

1407
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:31,678
You may step
to the back of the stage.

1408
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:33,470
Thank you.

1409
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,513
Good job!

1410
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:48,061
Denali, Rosé,
you both turned out

1411
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:51,030
phenomenal performances
this week.

1412
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,857
But there can only be
one winner.

1413
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:58,671
Two queens stand before me.

1414
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:02,308
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me,

1415
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:09,973
earn your first win,
and a cash tip of $5.000.

1416
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:16,456
I am so ready for this lip sync.

1417
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,858
I am not locked
in cinderblock ice skates.

1418
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,927
This is a cute-ass song,

1419
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:22,061
and I'm ready
to storm this stage.

1420
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,096
Let's fucking do it.

1421
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,298
The time has come...

1422
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,734
for you to lip sync...

1423
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:30,727
for the win.

1424
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,474
I feel a lot of pressure
right now.

1425
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:38,101
This would be complete
redemption from last week.

1426
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:44,117
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

Whereas Rosé is giving more of,
like, a comedy special.

Denali.

1470

You're a winner, baby.

1471
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:02,889
Yeah, bitch!

1472
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:05,391
Con-drag-ulations.

1473
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,093
You've won $5.000.

1474
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,062
I fucking won!

1475
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:12,165
Like, oh, my God,
this is exactly what I wanted.

1476
00:58:12,189 --> 00:58:15,301
It feels so good to just
have something go my way.

1477
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,971
It sends a great message
to the judges,

1478
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,505
and it shows the other girls

1479
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,965
if you go against me,
watch the fuck out.

1480
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,280
Rosé, you are safe
to slay another day.

1481
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:28,815
Thank you.

1482
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,316
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1483
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,486
Tonight you rocked.

1484
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,857
But starting next week,
heads will roll.

1485
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:41,394
Word. I'm freaking out, because
the competition has started

1486
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:45,064
and someone's gonna go home
each and every week.

1487
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,124
Ooh, scary.

1488
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:51,571
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1489
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:54,073
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1490
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:55,775
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1491
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:56,976
- Amen!
- Amen!

1492
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,112

to get next fucking level.

1504
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:34,080
You'll be starring in
cheesy holiday movies

1505
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:38,751

the RuPaulmark Channel.

1506
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,088
Whoo, come on, bitch!

Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.

1510
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,129
Who cast this ho?

1511
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:53,032
You had your lines,
you had the character.

1512
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,334
It was colorful, it was you.

1513
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:56,593
You were a joy to watch.

1515
00:59:59,496 --> 01:00:01,296
