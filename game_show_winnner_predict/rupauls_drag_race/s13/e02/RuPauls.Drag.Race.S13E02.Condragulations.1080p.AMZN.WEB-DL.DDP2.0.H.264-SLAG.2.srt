00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:08,182
Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,320
For the first time
inDrag Race herstory,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,458
we're kicking off the season

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:16,586
with six lip syncs
for your lives.

5
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,700
Bitch, excuse me?

6
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:23,700
Kandy Muse, LaLa Ri,
Symone, Gottmik,

7
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,424
Olivia Lux, Tina Burner,
shantay you stay.

8
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:29,044
Aah!

9
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:34,424
Joey Jay, Denali,
Tamisha Iman, Utica, Rosé,

10
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,044
Kahmora Hall, and Elliott,

11
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:38,689
that means you're
getting the porkchop.

12
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:44,113
Here we all are
in the porkchop lounge,

13
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,562
who famously went home first.

14
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:48,251
Is that what's gonna happen
to all of us?

15
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:52,493
Attention, Queens.

16
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:57,493
You all have a chance
to return to the competition.

17
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:04,034
But first, you must give one
of your fellow queens the chop.

18
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,758
Let the voting begin.

19
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:13,458
Wait, for real-real?

20
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,665
How do... what?

21
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:15,907
This is fucked.

22
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,458
This is...

23
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,320
crazy.

24
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:20,734
We all have a chance to stay,

25
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:22,734
but we have to vote
one of the girls in the room

26
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:24,424
out the competition.

27
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:25,425
That becomes overwhelming.

28
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:28,217
What are we going to do?

29
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:30,769
I don't wanna vote anyone off.
I don't know any of you yet.

30
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:32,320
We literally just met.

31
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:33,700
None of us saw
each other's lip syncs.

32
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,010
I don't know how to pick.

33
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:36,148
I mean, the only thing
we know about each other

34
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:37,182
is our first impression.

35
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,803
We have to vote someone off.

36
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,424
This is a competition.

37
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,355
This is what we signed up for.

38
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,172
All right, bitches,
shit about to go down.

39
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,389
Each individual girl
has to walk up to the box,

40
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:57,803
select the lipstick with
one of the girls' names on it,

41
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,769
and drop it in the box.

42
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:02,872
If we're going off
of first impressions,

43
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,458
I don't know you, sis,
but where's the look?

44
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:09,769
I don't see wow factor.

45
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:12,320
I hate to be the shallow bitch,

46
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,803
but I'm just not a fan
of chicken feathers.

47
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:17,734
Kahmora and myself, we're
both in ostrich feathers,

48
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,217
and she's in
the lower-quality feathers.

49
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,758
So sorry, girl, gotta go.

50
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,631
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

51
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,758
Utica, you gotta go.

52
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:30,769
It sucks to have to vote.

53
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,562
I don't wanna crush
somebody's dream,

54
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,527
and I definitely do not
want my dream to be crushed.

55
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:37,862
I'm scared that
I could be voted out.

56
00:02:55,896 --> 00:03:00,251
Attention, queens
in the porkchop loading dock.

57
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,596
The votes are in!

58
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,448
We have a tie...

59
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:13,700
Between Elliott with 2 Ts

60
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:17,907
and Utica.

61
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,458
Let the tie-breaker
voting round begin.

62
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:21,862
Oh, no.

63
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:25,079
We have to do a tie-breaker.

64
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:29,000
This time, we can only vote
between Utica and Elliott.

65
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,424
I'm trying to fight
for this crown,

66
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:36,320
and I feel like my dream
is slowly fading away.

67
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:39,734
As each queen goes up
and chooses again,

68
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,907
my heart just drops
lower and lower

69
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,251
as the queens pick theirs.

70
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,724
I'm just dreading the worst.

71
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:58,217
The votes are in!

72
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:03,896
The queen that's getting
the first chop is...

73
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:08,206
Elliott with 2 Ts.

74
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,286
All righty, then.

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,941
Pblblblbl.

76
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,700
It's been a lovely 15 minutes
with all of you.

77
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,389
I'm disappointed
that it ended like this,

78
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:24,872
because I got sent home
for something

79
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:30,010
that I didn't have any say in
or any power over,

80
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,631
and that sucks.

81
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,010
And I feel like
I've let my fiancé down,

82
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,551
and I'm 100% heartbroken.

83
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,907
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:46,320
Unfortunately, we had
to vote somebody out,

85
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:47,769
and it was Elliott.

86
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,010
And while that's sad,
it's also a joyous occasion,

87
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,320
because the less people here,
the closer I am to the crown.

88
00:04:59,206 --> 00:05:00,493
The winner ofRuPaul's Drag Race

89
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:02,079
receives a one-year supply

90

98

- All right!
- Okay?

99
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,976
It's a new day.
Last week was crazy.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,148
The twists and turns.

101
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,148
I still don't even know
what's going on.

102
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:34,700
But I'm just happy to be here.

103
00:05:34,724 --> 00:05:37,631
You guys, this is our,
like, first, kind of, day.

104
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:39,424
- Day. It's official.
- It's official.

105
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:41,493
After all that craziness,
bitch, well...

106
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,976
Hello, winner's circle.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,010
- Hello!
- Hey!

108
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,251
Hello, winners.

109
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,113
There's high expectations
now for us,

110
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,182
now that we won this lip sync.

111
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:49,596
Yeah. Tea.

112
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,907
I wonder if we're gonna
get to meet the other girls.

113
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:53,148
We already sent them home.
That's it.

114
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,389
And if they're saved,

115
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,148
we went through that
on our first day,

116
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:58,389
- that's shady.
- I know, and if they're back,

117
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,182
they're gonna have
a vengeance, mama.

118
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:01,838
If for whatever reason
they happen to come back,

119
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,251
it's us against them,
because it's top six,

120
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,286
the winner's circle, and
they can't take that from us.

121
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,113
- That's it.
- I wanna see some bitches fight.

122
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,286
You gotta go.

123
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,941
I'm ready for you to fight,
bitch.

124
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,182
Not me!

125
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,044
Okay, all from Brooklyn.

126
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,217
Bitches already think
I'm causing trouble,

127
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,458
and I'm just here
to be a good girl.

128
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:16,838
- You are causing trouble, Kandy!
- Oh, girl.

129
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,217
Kandy, you walk in the room
and cause trouble.

130
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,424
You Captain Trouble, honey.

131
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:24,286
In New York, Kandy is known
to be like cunty and bitchy,

132
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,044
and, like, trying
to literally cause drama.

133
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,527
It's just not my tea, sis.

134
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,907
We'll see. We shall see, ladies.

135
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,596
Ooh, girl.

136
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,355
She done already
done had herses.

137
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,113
Woman's calling us.

138
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:42,355
My queens, con-drag-ulations.

139
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,976
I wanna thank you
for a job well done.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,320
But now is the time to guard

141
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,907
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

142
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:55,482
from the fickle finger of fate.

143
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,907
I don't think I know
those words.

144
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,872
What the hell
does that shit mean?

145
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:04,424
Hello, hello, hello!

146
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,182
You better come on in this suit.

147
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,596
Racers, welcome
to RuPaul's Drag Race.

148
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,700
How do you like
the season so far?

149
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,631
Crazy.

150
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:17,976
Well, this week,

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,872
you can all take a deep breath
and just relax.

152
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:24,838
Oh, who am I kidding?

153
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,010
That's never gonna happen.

154
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:30,700
Now, before we get
to know you officially,

155
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:34,113
I wanna introduce you
to a fabulous queen

156
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,769
who'll be joining you
in the competition.

157
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,182
Uh-uh.

158
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,458
That's right,
someone I don't think

159
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,182
got a fair chance last week.

160
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:46,965
And I think she'll fit in
with this group just right.

161
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,907
Hello!

162
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,769
- Oh!
- Oh!

163
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:59,631
Guess who's back
in the house? Yeah.

164
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:02,665
This little angel twink
walks in.

165
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,872
I have no idea who it is,
but I'm gagged.

166
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:08,182
Elliott with 2 Ts.

167
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:09,596
I thought I sent you home.

168
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,389
We told you this season
would be full of surprises.

169
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,803
What the hell?

170
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,182
Why do you get to come back
into the competition

171
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,803
if you weren't one of the girls

172
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,448
that won their lip sync
during the first week?

173
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:25,493
What the fuck?
I sent that bitch packing.

174
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,803
What's going on?
Why is she back?

175
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:30,941
And what did she do
to get back here?

176
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,355
You smell that? It's distrust.

177
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,389
Hey, Elliott.

178
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,596
Hello.

179
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,803
You went through it last week,

180
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,320
but you are back
to prove once again

181
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,734
that losing is the new winning.

182
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,769
#DragRace.

183
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,355
Now, I want you all
to really hear this.

184
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,010
No queen is a loser
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

185
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:55,286
Victoria "Porkchop" Parker
was the very first queen

186
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,424
to ever be eliminated
on RuPaul's Drag Race

187
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,458
13 years ago.

188
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:03,803
And today,
she is a living legend.

189
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,838
Just ask anyone
at the Golden Corral.

190
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:10,113
Now, Shangela and Vanjie

191
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,251
were the first eliminated
from their seasons,

192
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:17,734
only to return and reach new
heights of international fame.

193
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,044
That's the tea.

194
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,079
Racers, you signed up
for a competition.

195
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,217
Queens will be eliminated.

196
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,458
But the moral
of this fairy tale is simple.

197
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,596
No matter what happens here,
out there, or online,

198
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,941
don't let anyone
make you feel like a loser.

199
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:36,941
Amen.

200
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:37,942
You know why?

201
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,700
Because you're a winner, baby.

202
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,320
Aah!

203
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:43,321
So let's get started.

204
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,562
All right.

205
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:46,458
Time to test
your fashion skills.

206
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:49,320
For your first mini-challenge,

207
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:53,907
you need to stomp the runway
in two devastating looks.

208
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:56,355
First, a ladylike daytime look,

209
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,044
and second,
a vampy nighttime look

210
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:01,734
that says, "I'm a whore."

211
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,769
Can you pull that off?

212
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:05,941
Every day.

213
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:09,010
Okay, Glamazons,
I'll see you on the runway.

214
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,596
Let's go.

215
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,251
Oh, yeah!

216
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:15,803
You bitch! You're a linebacker.

217
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:20,872
Our first mini-challenge
is a sickening runway show.

218
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,700
My soul has completely
returned to my body.

219
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,113
I'm ready to compete.

220
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,872
Girl, I get to
pull out my looks.

221
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,838
I get to model. Let's do it!

222
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,182
Cue the music, let's go!

223
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:34,493
Oh! Oh, my God, I'm living
my mirror fantasy!

224
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,286
I've always dreamt

225
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,976
about getting ready
in these werkroom mirrors.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,769
It's making me so excited.

227
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:45,217
I totally feel like the real
competition is about to start.

228
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,655
Start your engines, bitch.

229
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,527
Ooh, the melanin girls
on this side.

230
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,148
- Oh, yes!
- Hello!

231
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:54,769
Brown girl power.

232
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,596
So how y'all feeling

233
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,803
about having a new bitch
in the competition?

234
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,217
The new girl?
I'm a little baffled,

235
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,941
because I liked the top six
from the beginning.

236
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:01,976
I thought it was
a cute moment, too,

237
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,148
but we should have known.

238
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,596
Bitch, what are you here to do?

239
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,010
Are you spying on us?

240
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,217
Bitch, RuPaul's set the bar.
She thinks she's slick.

241
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:11,389
But I already caught on
to her game.

242
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,700
Tina, how you feeling,

243
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,596
because you sent
Miss Elliott home, correct?

244
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,044
Well, we obviously know that
you can send somebody home,

245
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:18,355
and here they are.

246
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,113
All right.

247
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,458
- You never know!
- You never know.

248
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,251
I do not trust Elliott.

249
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,803
Elliott the spy, honey.

250
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,907
Well, keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

251
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:31,379
Guess who I painted next to?
Elliott.

252
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,941
Isn't it so crazy to think,
like, you're a Ru girl?

253
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:38,734
- Ru girl, right, bitch?
- You're a Ru girl!

254
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:41,079
Kandy Muse, you've been
saying you're a Ru girl

255
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:43,458
for the last six years,
so I don't wanna hear it.

256
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,596
People called me
an adjacent Ru girl before this,

257
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,079
but that's because
a lot of my drag family

258
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:49,907
has been on Drag Racebefore.

259
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,872
Aja's my drag mother
and Dahlia's my drag sister,

260
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,458
so I walk into things
thinking I'm already famous.

261
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,355
So I may not be a Ru girl
before this,

262
00:11:58,379 --> 00:11:59,596
but I'm gonna walk in there
like I am a Ru girl.

263
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,803
You gonna think I'm a Ru girl.

264
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,493
But I have a question.

265
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,596
It's something that I've noticed
a lot in the past seasons.

266
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,044
When girls come in

267
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,769
and they instantly say,
"Oh, my mom was on this season,"

268
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,010
whatever, this season,
they usually go home early.

269
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,148
- Oh?
- Oh?

270
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:14,389
Do you think
that's gonna affect you?

271
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,872
- No.
- No?

272
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,907
First of all, bitch,
who is talking to you?

273
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:23,286
Second of all, girl,
I don't even know you.

274
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,631
You done just walked
into the werkroom, okay?

275
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,217
Because, like, Vanjie came in
and was, like,

276
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,389
"I'm Alexis Mateo's daughter,"
went home.

277
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,838
Dahlia, "I'm Aja's daughter,"
went home.

278
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,527
Like, it's weird.
It's interesting to me.

279
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,217
You better break the mold, sis.

280
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:39,872
Elliott walks in here
first time de-dragging

281
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:42,113
just snapping like that,

282
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,700
like, I think she is here
to serve possible bitch.

283
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,976
"Aren't you worried that
your sister went home first

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,803
and you could go home first?"

285
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,079
You might wanna come down
with that, Elliott with 2 Ts.

286
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,769
There ain't no girl I would
just, like, come for her

287
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:56,389
if I don't know her.

288
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,596
Ooh.

289
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,862
Uh-huh.

290
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,665
I know it, because
he was getting to you.

291
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:08,907
- I felt it.
- Mm-hmm.

292
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:12,458
Girl, you just walked in here.

293
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,458
I don't know if
Miss Elliott with 2 Ts

294
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:17,148
wants to prove to the other
girls that she's a big, bad wolf

295
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,044
because she just
walked into this competition,

296
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:20,769
but I'm gonna do
what I'm gonna do,

297
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:22,596
and that's focus on me.

298
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,044
Because the pressure's
definitely on,

299
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,251
because my sister Dahlia
went home first on Season 12,

300
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,493
and I don't wanna
repeat history.

301
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,517
So, no, ma'am.

302
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,458
Coming up...

303
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:35,872
Category is Nighttime
Is The Right Time.

304
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,700
The bitch has arrived
at the party, honey.

305
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,010
Bitch!

306
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,562
I know you did not just trip.

307
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:42,803
What in the hell?

308
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:59,010
Category is Daytime Drama, Mama.

309
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,655
Fashion!

310
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,113
First up, Gottmik.

311
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:07,907
She's your weather girl,
and has she got news for you.

312
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,872
My daytime look
represents my drag style,

313
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:13,044
because it's
a fitted latex number,

314
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,734
oversized shoulders,
structured hair,

315
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:17,976
but with a girlie twist.

316
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,286
O-M-G, we match, we're rainbros.

317
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,872
It's cutesy, and I feel
like a little princess

318
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,044
in the middle of the day.

319
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,182
I'm normally intense
with my looks,

320
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,079
and I usually paint my face
clown white.

321
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,320
So, hello, showing them
range already.

322
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:35,941
A 100% chance of gorgeous.

323
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,665
I'm gonna say everything
like Don Adams.

324
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:39,632
Would you believe

325
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,769
100% chance of gorgeous?

326
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:45,251
Kandy Muse. Rock me, Mama-deus.

327
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,665
Mama-deus? Mama-deus?

328
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:47,872
I am excited to walk the runway,

329
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,596
because this is what I do.

330
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,424
Baby, I've been modeling in
the fucking streets of New York

331
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:53,596
my entire life.

332
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,010
Bitch, I might pretend

333
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,251
I'm walking down
a fashion show in Paris.

334
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,562
I'm just like...

335
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,838
even though I'm in the hood.

336
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:01,458
But it's fine,
it's cool, I love it.

337
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:05,010
This looks isn't necessarily
a classic Kandy look,

338
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,631
but I'm trying
to show the judges

339
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,493
that a big girl
can be fashion-forward.

340
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:09,769
So I'm gonna give you couture.

341
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:12,596
The Red Queen.
Off with her head!

342
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,286
Do-re-mi, LaLa Ri.

343
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,872
Ooh, the braid of it all.

344
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:18,873
She's part of the braidy bunch.

345
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,148
Okay.

346
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,493
Miss LaLa Ri is giving you

347
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,941
very Southern belle tease.

348
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,734
I'm in the field
with a glass of lemonade.

349
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,907
You know, she got her braids
cocked to the side,

350
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,113
and she swish it back
for the boys to see.

351
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,665
You know, hey, how you doing?

352
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,493
I'm walking down the runway,
living my best life,

353
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:33,217
and then boom, bitch,

354
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:35,389
I trip over all
this extra-ass fabric.

355
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,182
I'm like, bitch!

356
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:40,769
I know you did not just trip
on these good people's runway.

357
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,044
But don't fall, ho.

358
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,872
Do not fall. And I did not fall.

359
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,286
She going back
to the secret garden.

360
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,750
- Okay.
- Put the petal to the metal.

361
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,700
Olivia Lux.

362
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,527
She looks at life
through lilac-colored glasses.

363
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,769
I prefer Rose Nylund glasses.

364
00:15:56,793 --> 00:16:01,113
This daytime drag
is flirty fashion.

365
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:05,320
She's walking down Fifth
Avenue without a care in the world,

366
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,631
and she has
her weekend bag in hand.

367
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,872
Everything she needs
for the weekend.

368
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:12,286
You know, you can tell
a lot about a queen

369
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,596
by the size of her purse.

370
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,527
When I walk,
the ponytail's going, like...

371
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,907
I'm living
this lavender fantasy.

372
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:23,458
Olivia Lux.
She has no Lux left to give.

373
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,700
Ladies and gentlemen, Symone.

374
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,941
The circus is in town,
and she's the big top.

375
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,286
Well, that makes one of us.

376
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,355
There's gotta be at least one.

377
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,320
My look,
inspired by the nineties,

378
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,113
with player's club hair.

379
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,251
My shoulders out,
a little peek-a-boo,

380
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,596
and then you turn around
and boom,

381
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,113
there's a cape
in the back, honey.

382
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:46,941
A little bit of old meets new,
which is very Symone.

383
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,389
Giving you everything.

384
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,044
Symone Pointer,
the last Pointer Sister.

385
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:53,872
Tina Burner.

386
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,493
She got my kettle boiling.

387
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,838
In my daytime look,

388
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,803
I'm living
my Carrie Bradshaw fantasy

389
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:02,182
in, like, a tutu,
but, like, fitted Dior top.

390
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,665
I got a big-ass bow.

391
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,044
People are gonna bow down,
honey.

392
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,389
Bow, bow.
Is that spelled the same?

393
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:10,838
Oh, my God, it is!
Bow down to my bow.

394
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,803
I gotta get me a Burner phone.

395
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:14,803
I do, yeah.

396
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,286
Tina Burner phone.

397
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,286
Elliott with 2 Ts.

398
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,044
I wonder if she got
that raspberry beret

399
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,217
at a second-hand store?

400
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,941
I do know she came in
through the out door.

401
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,803
Getting to do two runway looks

402
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,217
is so exciting,
because I get to show

403
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:33,010
why I was given
a second chance to be here.

404
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,562
And girl, I'm so ready.

405
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,758
And fancy was her name.

406
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:48,596
Category is Nighttime
Is The Right Time.

407
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,976
I told you twice the first time.

408
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,493
First up, Gottmik.

409
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,941
Now, is it me, or does she
look a little pasty?

410
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,355
This look, oh,

411
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,044
she's gonna steal your soul.

412
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:06,148
She is a spooky-ductress,

413
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,596
and, girl, my titty's out.

414
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,734
Ever since I got my top surgery,

415
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,389
I love having my chest out,
let me tell you that.

416
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,458
I am living for it,

417
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,251
and I never want
this feeling to go away.

418
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,734
Must get moose and squirrel.

419
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:20,758
Natasha.

420
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,976
Kandy Muse.

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,596
What in the hell?

422
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,665
This look definitely represents

423
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,079
a little more Kandy Muse,

424
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,355
because I love latex,
I love being sexy,

425
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,562
I love showing body,
I love showing curves.

426
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:36,148
It's just everything, bitch.
I'm everything.

427
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:38,734
She gets her kicks on Route 666.

428
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,251
The hole.

429
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,665
Is that for a tail, you think?

430
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,320
Not today, Satan.

431
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,044
Do-re-mi for LaLa Ri.

432
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,286
Salt-n-Peplum.

433
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,287
Yes.

434
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,665
Baby, that look,

435
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,389
I'm not over-over-the-top
drag girl.

436
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,389
But whatever I give you,
I'm going to sell it.

437
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,458
They say give you whore,
I'm gonna give you whore.

438
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,872
Ass out, titties out, pleather.

439
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,286
Not leather, 'cause
a bitch can't afford it.

440
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,010
But, bitch, I'm still serving it
like it's leather, girl.

441
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:18,011
I live for this look.

442
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,700
Honey, be the chain

443
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,182
you wanna see in the world.

444
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:22,976
Olivia Lux.

445
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,700
Oh. This time
she packed her big bag.

446
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,424
I'm really excited

447
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:29,769
to flip the script

448
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,424
and be this mysterious
mistress of the night.

449
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:35,148
I don't normally do dark hair,

450
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:38,424
but something about
this rich chocolate brown

451
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,320
against that
glittering burgundy,

452
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,527
a night at the opera, perhaps.

453
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:47,148
Trend alert.
Teeny, tiny handbags.

454
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:48,355
Teeny, teeny, tiny.

455
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,493
She packed an overnight bag.

456
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:50,872
All she needs are her panties.

457
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,596
Tee-hee!

458
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,355
Symone. Yes, honey.

459
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:58,734
Ooh, is the bus still running?

460
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:01,355
The bitch has arrived
at the party, honey,

461
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,838
Let's go.

462
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:06,251
For evening, Symone is
giving you very Mother Goddess

463
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,562
combined with
the last people in the matrix

464
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:10,941
partying and dying, darling.

465
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,700
Get this side.
It's my good side.

466
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:13,724
Oh, every angle.

467
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:16,528
Ooh, it looks like she started

468
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:18,872
the walk of shame early.

469
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,700
See you next Symone day.

470
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,458
Tina Burner.

471
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,665
What's latex got to do with it?

472
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,493
All her exes live in latexes.

473
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:29,872
I'm letting the judges know

474
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,562
that I not only can be
a costume comedy queen,

475
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:37,389
but I can be a sexy seductress,
fun party girl.

476
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:41,113
My boots are up to my pussy,
and I am swinging my hair,

477
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,458
trying not to throw my neck out

478
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:43,527
because I'm old.

479
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,458
I'm serving you my red claws,

480
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:46,734
because she's gonna claw
the competition.

481
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:50,458
Tina Burner,
available only on vinyl.

482
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,389
Something wicked this way comes.

483
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,631
Elliott with 2 Ts.

484
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,320
Michelle's been good,
but I've been bad.

485
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:03,769
This look right here
is out of the box for Elliott.

486
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:08,838
It is dark and mysterious
and just sex.

487
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,286
This look is what you see

488
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,872
when you go to the
gentleman's club on a fetish night.

489
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:14,839
And don't get too close to her.

490
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:16,700
She might whip you, honey.

491
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:18,562
And, poof, there she goes.

492
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,700
Well, that's it. Show's over.

493
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:22,286
My car is here.

494
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,976
- Oh.
- Bye.

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,286
Is the bus still running?

496
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,113
Yeah, can I borrow
a little change?

497
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,665
Yeah, I gotcha.

498
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,079
Coming up...

499
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,941
I'm still gagged Miss Thing
came for me earlier.

500
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:34,527
I already feel like I'm
the red-headed stepsister.

501
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,700
That's strike one.

502
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,217
Bitch, strike two, you out.

503
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,286
Oh, here we go.
It's starting early.

504
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,976
Oh, my.

505
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,976
Oh, my God.

506
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,424
Jesus!

507
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:51,562
That was everything.

508
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,148
Oh, bitch, oh, oh, oh.

509
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:54,769
My feet hurt so bad.

510
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,596
We're back in the werkroom,
and I'm looking around the room,

511
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,596
and everyone brought it
for the fashion show, bitch.

512
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,148
I'm kind of gagged.

513
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:03,113
I feel real confident,
I feel real good.

514
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:05,010
Can't wait
for that maxi-challenge.

515
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,872
We gonna see what happens.

516
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,389
Get this hair up off me, Lord.

517
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,424
Take it off, take it off,
take it...

518
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,803
- Ahh, feel that.
- Oh, Lord.

519
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,355
That's better than sex, honey.

520
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,700
Can someone get my hair
outta my dress?

521
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,182
Thank you, dude.

522
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,286
Ooh. Ugh!

523
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:23,148
Bitch, it's like
a steamed hamhog.

524
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:26,000
What the hell is a "hamhog?"

525
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,424
I just wanna hose myself down.

526
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,631
Oh, she's on brand.
Hose, fire hose, firemen.

527
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,148
- Oh, come on!
- Tina Burner!

528
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:36,010
Oh, here we go, here we go.
It's starting early.

529
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,700
Girl, I'm still so gagged
Miss Thing came for me earlier.

530
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,941
Miss New Girl on the Block?

531
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,320
Miss 2 Ts over there.

532
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,907
Mother hen got comfortable
real fast, girl.

533
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:44,734
Real fast, and that's
the thing, though.

534
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:46,769
Like, I respect everyone,
I give everyone a fair chance.

535
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:48,044
But if you're trying
to come for me

536
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,251
and I'm on the other side
of the room

537
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:50,734
minding my damn business...

538
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:53,389
Child, the entire time
Elliott has been here with us,

539
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,251
all that has been
running through my head

540
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,596
is "spy, spy, spy."

541
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,563
Don't trust the bitch.

542
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,010
That's strike one.

543
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,596
Bitch, ain't no strike three.
Strike two, you out.

544
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,379
- You only get two strikes.
- Mm-hmm.

545
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,562
Hey, fashion icons.

546
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:09,528
- Oh!
- Ooh!

547
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:11,000
Are you decent?

548
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:13,965
I'll take that as a "no." Yeah.

549
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:19,389
Racers, are you ready
to rock my world?

550
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,424
- Yes.
- Yes.

551
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,941
For your first maxi-challenge,

552
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:26,493
you need to perform
a new show-stopping version

553
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,217
of my song Condragulations.

554
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,527
Oh!

555
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,734
Aah!

556
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,182
Which is featured

557
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,976
as part
of the Werq the World tour.

558
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,355
For tickets and information,
go to VossEvents.com.

559
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:44,803
Now, each of you
needs to try and outdo me

560
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,596
with your own original verse.

561
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,010
Try it. I dare you.

562
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,700
- Ooh!
- Aah!

563
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,907
Then, as a group,

564
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:57,217
you need to come up with
your own winning choreography.

565
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:58,665
Oh, shit.

566
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,734
Any dancers in the house?

567
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:05,286
Now remember, the lyrics,
the performance, and the look

568
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,631
all need to show the world
that you are number one.

569
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:11,941
Racers, start your engines,

570
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:15,320
and may the best drag queen win!

571
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:20,148
Let's put the pen to the paper.

572
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,320
Rap...

573
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,655
lyrics.

574
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,631
Has anyone
written lyrics before?

575
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,872
I mean, I consider myself
a lyricist.

576
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm sure you do.

577
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:39,355
Well, you've been
in a boy band, so...

578
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,079
Yes, honey.

579
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:43,596
So the first thing we have to do
for this maxi-challenge

580
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,631
is we have to sit down and we
gotta write out these lyrics.

581
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:49,251
And then we go up to Sweden
to record the vocals.

582
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:52,079
Because if you know
your boy band herstory,

583
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:55,527
all the boy bands go to Sweden,
and that's where they keep you

584
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:58,769
and they lock you up until
you come back with some singles.

585
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:02,355
Do you wanna sing or do you
wanna be, like, a bitch track?

586
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:03,562
Or, like, rapping?

587
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,424
- I don't know.
- Are you a bitch track?

588
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:06,631
I mean, I can...

589
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:07,665
She's a bitch track.

590
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:08,631
I'm a bitch track, but, like...

591
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:09,632
She's a bitch album.

592
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,734
I actually write music.

593
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,562
- Do you really?
- Word.

594
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,838
I compose music, yeah.

595
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,631
So I play the piano,
but I also write music.

596
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,286
Oh, she is a musician.

597
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,182
I'm so excited.

598
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:22,010
Our first maxi-challenge,

599
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,907
and we're writing music,
something I'm good at!

600
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:28,803
Who's ready
to be the star student? Me!

601
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:33,010
Don't forget, like, we're gonna
be judged also on what we write.

602
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,044
And that's
gonna be eternal, bitch.

603
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,286
That's what I'm saying.

604
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,769
So you think
you're just gonna be cute,

605
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:39,148
but remember, these lyrics
are gonna chase you around

606
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,424
for the rest of your life.

607
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:41,941
And that's
so much more pressure.

608
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:44,010
Girl, we're gonna be jet-set.
It's gonna be gorg.

609
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,838
Well, I mean, we're
definitely all performers,

610
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:47,493
since we won
that first lip sync.

611
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,700
- Well...
- Well...

612
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,872
Oh, my.

613
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,734
Coming off of losing
my first lip sync,

614
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:58,217
it's a lot of stress
and a lot of pressure.

615
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,769
I already feel like these girls

616
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:02,562
feel like they have some type
of advantage over me.

617
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,493
I'm the red-headed stepsister.

618
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:07,286
I need to do an incredible job,

619
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,103
because I cannot
be sent home again.

620
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,596
Coming up...

621
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,838
♪ Condragulations,
you're number one ♪

622
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:16,251
How about
"Congratulations to our spot

623
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,286
for the next ho to come out?"

624
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,044
You a dancer now?

625
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:20,389
Let's just get
the choreography done,

626
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,527
because we're on limited time.

627
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:23,872
Girl, this is some bullshit.

628
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,389
All right, bitch.

629
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:33,389
Back on the stage.

630
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:37,079
So now it is time to get
this choreography together.

631
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,700
We have to choreograph
this entire thing,

632
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:41,838
top to bottom,
from our own noggins.

633
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:43,527
Okay, so what do we do?

634
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,665
We're on. Who wants
to start this thing off?

635
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:46,148
So you start first?

636
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,734
We should do the things
we're gonna do together first.

637
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,320
So we should do, like,
the chorus first,

638
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,320
and then focus on
individual stuff after.

639
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,321
- Sure.
- I agree.

640
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,631
Okay. So then let's start.

641
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,034
Who's a dancer
who is good with the choreo?

642
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:06,251
Cricket, cricket.

643
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:10,113
Girl, nobody
wants to be in charge.

644
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,182
And there you have it.

645
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:15,010
These girls don't know
that this is what I do.

646
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,458
I'm a choreograph dancer.

647
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:19,113
But I don't want to take charge

648
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,424
when I literally just walked in.

649
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,217
So I'm trying to just sit back,

650
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,424
let these hos figure it out,

651
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,355
and I'll just do what I'm told.

652
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,217
What if we all just went off

653
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,700
like ♪ Condragulations ♪

654
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:30,355
♪ We're number one, one, one ♪

655
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:31,631
Should it be this,
or should it be like this?

656
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:32,769
That's too cheer-ish.

657
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:33,941
And then we could
do it together.

658
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:35,907
We could go together, like that.

659
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:37,251
That way, you can
bring the hand down,

660
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,113
and maybe we should
put the hand on the waist?

661
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,448
And one?

662
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:45,424
This is some bullshit.

663
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:46,941
Options, bitch.

664
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,389
Oh, I like the options,
but I also...

665
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,803
We should definitely get,
like, a choreo down,

666
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:51,113
then formation after.

667
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,527
This is like a pop song,

668
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:55,562
it's not like no one, two,
Supreme-like type thing.

669
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:56,941
Like, we need
to boo-boo kat-kat.

670
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,217
This is choreography.

671
00:27:58,241 --> 00:27:59,527
This is the shit you can find

672
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:01,700
in a parking lot
on the south side of Atlanta,

673
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:03,286
and you don't wanna go through
south side of Atlanta, baby.

674
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,044
Trust me.

675
00:28:06,068 --> 00:28:08,320
Girl, this is some bullshit.

00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:10,562

you can't do a one-two?

So let's take it from the top
again, from the chorus.

695
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,182
And then we gotta move on,
you guys.

696
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,872
We got so much to do.

697
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:55,251

Okay, let's do that, then.

702
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:06,010
- Is that cool?
- Sure.

703
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,217
I think it looks better
if we do...

704
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,251
- I like opposite.
- I like opposite.

705
00:29:09,275 --> 00:29:13,562
It's becoming a lot harder
to not just take the reins.

706
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,563
So take it from the top?

707
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,044
- Tina?
- Yes?

708
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,527
Bah-gock. So what
I think we should do

709
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:21,010
is how about, since
our leg's already out,

710
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:22,803
we just turn on it,
since our leg is already out.

711
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,113
- Ooh.
- From the snap, turn.

712
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,907
So much fun.

713
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,355
Da.

714
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:30,803
You a dancer now?

715
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,424
All of a sudden, hey, Juilliard.

716
00:29:33,448 --> 00:29:36,562
After we do the "Tell you
all the prizes you have won,

717
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:39,803
congratulations," to our spot,
for the next ho to come out.

718
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,493
We're already halfway through,
and now you're speaking up?

719
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:43,941
We already think
you're the mole.

720
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:44,907
Let's just get
the choreography done,

721
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:45,908
because we have limited time.

722
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:47,320
Okay.

723
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:48,803
I don't trust you, girl.

724
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,631
Do you guys wanna just, like,
stay in this formation

725
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,355
and then just go up
and do our solos?

726
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:54,320
Let's get a beat in the ear.

727
00:29:58,137 --> 00:30:02,872
♪ Gottmik
was born a girl, baby ♪

728
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,000
Uh!

729
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,838
Oh, my God.

730
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:11,182
I wrote "I'm born a girl,"

731
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:13,182
and I haven't talked
to this bitches about it.

732
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:15,044
So I did not know

733
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:18,424
that I was going to have
to have all these girls

734
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:22,217
hear about my gender situation
before I can even talk to them.

735
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:25,596
Uh, do you, like, know what
you're gonna do during the...

736
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,320
Ha-ha. Not really.

737
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:31,251
I'm just a deer in headlights
right now, basically.

738
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:36,424
I just can't even seem to talk,
which is very unlike me.

739
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:37,941
I don't know what's going
through their heads.

740
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:39,355
I shouldn't even
be focusing on that.

741
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,596
Like, who cares?

742
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,665
But we have to
perform this tomorrow.

743
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:45,907
What the fuck
are you gonna do, bitch?

744
00:30:45,931 --> 00:30:48,172
I feel like it'll just be,
like, very like...

745
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:52,389
Like a Gottmik,

746
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:55,665
and then it's like....

747
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:59,527
And then,
like, something, like...

748
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:01,527
I look over at Gottmik,

749
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:05,527
and I feel like Gottmik is
really in his head, you know?

750
00:31:05,551 --> 00:31:07,458
Something's going on.

751
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:08,941
I mean, there is
an internal struggle.

752
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,803
- Okay, so...
- I'm going here to back.

753
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:12,838
- Are you doing...
- I do this.

754
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:14,044
Are you doing a full circle?

755
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,838
I'm going all the way around,
yeah.

756
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:18,941
I can't take
any of these moves in.

757
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:20,941
I'm just having
a hard time focusing.

758
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:22,458
It's so weird
that I feel like this.

759
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:23,838
I didn't even know

760
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:25,976
that I had a lot of
gender dysphoria anymore.

761
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,493
So the fact that
it's throwing me

762
00:31:27,517 --> 00:31:30,907
into this weird hole like this
is so gaggy.

763
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,113
All right, ladies, time is up.

764
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:34,217
Oh, Lord.

765
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:35,872
I do not get like this.

766
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:39,103
If this sends me home right now,
I will not be happy.

767
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:41,941
Coming up...

768
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:43,355
Elliott, what happened
after you left?

769
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,976
I wanna know, because we
nicknamed you Elliott the Spy.

770
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,379
So you really wanna know?

771
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:50,355
Wait, what?

772
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:51,803
Oh, my God.

773
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:02,941
Meow! Yeah!

774
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,493
Money, honey-honey.

775
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:05,494
Let's get up in this gig.

776
00:32:05,518 --> 00:32:08,320
The first maxi-challenge
is here.

777
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,527
We have to perform it
in front of the judges.

778
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:13,320
Judgment day is upon us.

779
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,079
Who's excited
about tonight, honey?

780
00:32:15,103 --> 00:32:16,458
- I'm excited!
- Yes!

781
00:32:16,482 --> 00:32:18,424
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm excited.

782
00:32:18,448 --> 00:32:19,838
Yeah, it's nerve-wracking,

783
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:21,424
because rehearsal yesterday
was a little rough.

784
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,838
I went to bed worried myself.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

785
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:25,493
But I said we're the winners,
you know what I mean?

786
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:26,494
We're here, it's like a pack.

787
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:29,389
I literally feel

788
00:32:29,413 --> 00:32:31,562
like the world is on
my shoulders right now,

789
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,596
because I am the girl
that was brought back.

790
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,148
I feel like in the back
of everybody's head

791
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:37,424
I was the weakest link.

792
00:32:37,448 --> 00:32:40,044
So I have to turn this shit out.

793
00:32:40,068 --> 00:32:42,389
How are you feeling
about your solos?

794
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:45,562
I feel mine is the most
complex choreography.

795
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:46,700
Oh!

796
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:49,044
Oh, girl, please.

797
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,355
Mik, how are you feeling
about your performance?

798
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:53,562
A little better today.

799
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:56,113
I was, like, really
so stressed yesterday.

800
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:58,044
Like, you guys all dancing,

801
00:32:58,068 --> 00:32:59,011
to, like, talking
about how I'm a girl,

802
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:00,665
and it was like fucked to me.

803
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:03,355
I feel like
I based all my lyrics

804
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:05,044
about my gender situation,

805
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,527
and I haven't even
talked to you guys

806
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,596
about me being
a transgender guy drag queen.

807
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,182
Like, I was just gagged.

808
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,113
Like, my gender dysphoria,
like, took over my soul,

809
00:33:15,137 --> 00:33:16,734
which so isn't like me, too.

810
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:18,286
Because I usually
don't give a fuck.

811
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,596
I just couldn't even take in
any of the choreo at first,

812
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,493
because it was just like...
It was so intense.

813
00:33:23,517 --> 00:33:26,079
Like, it was, like,
I can't breathe about it.

814
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,148
Like, thank you
for sharing that with us.

815
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,493
And you're, like... you're
changing the shape of drag.

816
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:32,872
Like, this is... this is big.

817
00:33:32,896 --> 00:33:34,596
Thank God I feel
a little better today about it,

818
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,113
because that was a moment.

819
00:33:36,137 --> 00:33:39,079
But... yeah.

820
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:41,044
Gottmik reveals
that she is a trans man.

821
00:33:41,068 --> 00:33:44,148
It wasn't the right time
to talk about it in rehearsal,

822
00:33:44,172 --> 00:33:45,976
but I can be there for her now.

823
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,562
I'm so thankful and happy
that she was able to confide

824
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,286
and find that sister in me,

825
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,596
and I really wanna make sure

826
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,389
that I'm supporting her
every step of the way.

827
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:56,217
May I ask, what are pronouns...

828
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,700
Like, out of drag,
I use he/him/his,

829
00:33:58,724 --> 00:33:59,803
and then in drag, she/her/hers.

830
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:01,596
I'm the exact same way.

831
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,596
I feel like when people
are trying to overthink it

832
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,838
and they call me "he" in drag,

833
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:07,493
I'm like, bitch,
you're just clocking me

834
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:09,148
and making me feel,
like, so weird.

835
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,700
- Yeah.
- We're all guys here,

836
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:14,113
so if you're gonna call them
she, do not try it with me.

837
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,458
I feel like a weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.

838
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:18,665
Cards are on the table.

839
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,389
My normal,
slightly narcissistic,

840
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:26,113
confident Gottmik headspace
took back over.

841
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:29,872
Now I just need
to kill this performance.

842
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:32,389
- Miss Symone.
- Yes.

843
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,493
I know you were struggling
a little bit in the rehearsal.

844
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:35,251
I am struggling.

845
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,838
I am very nervous
about the group stuff,

846
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,251
and making sure
that, like, I'm on point

847
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,079
and I don't mess up
and make it, like...

848
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:44,838
I think that if you for
some reason happen to mess up,

849
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:47,113
go for it and give attitude.

850
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:49,941
Girl, it was on... I messed up,
yeah, but that was on purpose.

851
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,389
What do you know?
You don't know choreo.

852
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:52,390
The other girls are wrong,
darling, I'm right.

853
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:53,424
Okay?

854
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:56,700
Very that about it.

855
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,803
Yeah, story time.

856
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,079
Elliott, what happened
after you left?

857
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,769
The real tea, though, Elliott.

858
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:02,976
Like, what went on?

859
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,458
So you really wanna know?

860
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,010
I wanna know, because we
nicknamed you Elliott the Spy.

861
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:08,838
I feel like I'm speaking
for the group here.

862
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:09,872
- Y'all can back me up.
- No, you right.

863
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:10,873
- Yes, honey.
- That's true.

864
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,700
I thought you came outta nowhere

865
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,665
and you already got sent home.
It was a little weird.

866
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:17,355
Reveal yourself!
Reveal yourself!

867
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,527
Here's kinda what went down.

868
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,700
So all the losing girls

869
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:23,596
were set in the porkchop
loading dock.

870
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,286
RuPaul says you guys have
to vote one of the losers out.

871
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,665
Wait, what?

872
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:30,976
And they voted you out?

873
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,769
We did a lipstick vote.

874
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,113
It was a tie.

875
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:36,734
Then they had to break the tie
with a re-vote.

876
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,631
Oh, shit.

877
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,113
And it was unanimous.

878
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,907
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God.

879
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,182
All right, bitch, hold on.

880
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,010
Press pause.

881
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:50,389
She got eliminated
by Tina Burner. Boom.

882
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:53,493
And then you let
other eliminated girls

883
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:54,941
eliminate you again, sis?

884
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:56,700
Bitch, you got eliminated
three times

885
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:59,424
at the beginning of the season
on the first episode?

886
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,182
Oh.

887
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,079
So they think
that you went home.

888
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:05,872
Oh, now you're back
in the house.

889
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,562
So you might wanna make
some room in the werkroom

890
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,596
for some more girls.

891
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,424
Oh, my God.

892
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:12,941
That is gagging.

893
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,217
The girl that I beat
is coming back,

894
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,389
along with the other girls
that were beat?

895
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:19,286
I am definitely, like,
they are about to come back

896
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,320
with all the fires of hell
behind them.

897
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:23,631
Now that the tea is spilled,

898
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:25,113
we can kinda be nice to Elliott.

899
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,355
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

900
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:27,976
Well, I'm happy
to be here with you guys.

901
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,148
I love you guys so much.

902
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,389
- Oh!
- Oh, we love you, too.

903
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,769
We're Season 13 sisters now,
you guys.

904
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:35,113
Like, you can't take
that shit away, honey.

905
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,493
But, like, did we all forget

906
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,803
that we're also walking
into elimination tonight?

907
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:41,941
- We're all over here kiki-ing.
- Ooh, the mood has changed.

908
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,355
Oh, yeah, the mood
has changed, honey.

909
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,527
- The mood has changed, honey.
- Kandy?

910
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,976
Yes, baby?

911
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,665
If you had to send
somebody home in this room...

912
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,079
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, bitch.

913
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,217
Like, if I had to, like,
choose a lipstick,

914
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,458
I'm gonna send home
the biggest competition.

915
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:54,838
Because I wanna win.

916
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:57,320
So I would send home
Tina Burner. Goodbye.

917
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,389
I'll remember that.

918
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,734
Honestly, I'm afraid of Mik
and her fierce fashion.

919
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:05,286
Tina, who would you send home?

920
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,596
I mean, I have to send home Mik.

921
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,113
Thank you.

922
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:09,286
You just... you're a threat,
so I gotta send Mik home.

923
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,700
- Symone.
- Yeah, I would definitely...

924
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,803
It would be Tina.
You are a threat for sure.

925
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:13,941
LaLa?

926
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,631
I would say Mik.

927
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,010
Olivia, who would you send home?

928
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,355
Oh, yeah, Olivia,
who would you send home?

929
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:21,079
Well, I've realized
that a lot of you

930
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:25,148
don't think of me as the biggest
threat or a threat at all.

931
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:26,907
- She's nothing to me.
- Oh, it's not personal.

932
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:28,838
- Drag.
- Drag.

933
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,320
Good to know.

934
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:33,631
I think I am a big threat,
but the other girls don't.

935
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:36,251
I'm not as well-known
as some of the other girls,

936
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,769
but I'm not letting it
get in the way.

937
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:40,044
I have to show them
that I'm here for a reason.

938
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:42,596
Everybody loves
a dark horse, honey.

939
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,941
What'd you call me?

940
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,620

1051

Up first, Gottmik.

1052
00:43:04,413 --> 00:43:06,562
It's the creature
from the gold lamé.

1053
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:08,562
And the queen of the runway.

1054
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,458
My look
is inspired by sea dragons.

1055
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:14,148
I have a full lamé headpiece

1056
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:19,079
with pleated lamé crazy-stoned
artistry all around my face.

1057
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:21,424
I look like a lamé alien.

1058
00:43:21,448 --> 00:43:23,355
It's everything.

1059
00:43:23,379 --> 00:43:25,976
You know, I think
I saw that at Gold Navy.

1060
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,596
Kandy Muse.

1061
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,217
Négligée, you stay.

1062
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,355
Do I make you horny, baby?

1063
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,803
Fembot realness,

1064
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,631
in my purple nightgown,

1065
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,079
my little furry titties.

1066
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:43,596
I'm giving the judges
Kandy Muse to the T.

1067
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,596
Baby, pretty, sexy.

1068
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,044
Eat it up, bitch!

1069
00:43:47,068 --> 00:43:50,286
I like a good Nancy boot
and Daisy Duke, mm.

1070
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:53,286
These boots
were made for slaying.

1071
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,700
LaLa Ri.

1072
00:43:54,724 --> 00:43:56,527
Look, Ru, there's
gold in them thar hills!

1073
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:00,010
With this look, I wanted to go

1074
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:03,217
for a whole dark chocolate
wrapped in gold,

Golden Ticket situation, girl.

1076
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,424
Big hair, big garments.

1077
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:11,941
It's giving you
Atlanta drag-drag, you know.

1078
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:14,182
I hear she's in
the new Bond film:

1079
00:44:14,206 --> 00:44:15,769
Goldsphincter.

1080
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:18,148
Olivia Lux.

1081
00:44:18,172 --> 00:44:20,458
I think it's Olivia De-Lux.

1082
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:24,389
I am serving
a water lily goddess, honey.

1083
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:26,734
You see that little lily
on my shoulder?

1084
00:44:26,758 --> 00:44:28,665
It is trickling down.

1085
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:30,251
I mean, I am giving you

1086
00:44:30,275 --> 00:44:34,700
a walking, old Hollywood
portrait painting, honey.

1087
00:44:34,724 --> 00:44:36,113
She looks expensive.

1088
00:44:36,137 --> 00:44:38,493
I bet she saved up
and bought that on lamé-away.

1089
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:41,804
Symone.

1090
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:42,838

I got a little cut
on my eyebrow, honey.

1095
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:54,665
I'm giving it to you.

1096
00:44:54,689 --> 00:44:56,734
I definitely wanted this runway

1097
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:58,458
to be a little bit more clever,

1098
00:44:58,482 --> 00:45:02,286
showing that there is a brain
behind the beauty, darling.

1099
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,665
Y'all, does this mean she spits?

1100
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,596
That's a wrap on Michelle.

1101
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,286

Motorcycle jacket and these
high-waisted lamé mom pants.

1109
00:45:29,413 --> 00:45:30,838
I thought it was so important

1110
00:45:30,862 --> 00:45:33,872

was so well done.

Thank you.

1136
00:46:39,275 --> 00:46:40,286
The difference
between your day look,

1137
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,803
which was like preschool fun,

1138
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:44,941
and your night look, which
was like, you know, evil whore...

1139
00:46:44,965 --> 00:46:47,148
I mean that could
kinda look like Michelle.

1140
00:46:48,862 --> 00:46:49,839
You were so versatile.

1141
00:46:49,863 --> 00:46:52,527
And this look is already iconic.

1142
00:46:52,551 --> 00:46:54,148
It's trending.

1143
00:46:54,172 --> 00:46:56,355
Now, the performance, I will say
that in the beginning,

1144
00:46:56,379 --> 00:46:59,458
I did sense a little bit
of hesitation in the front.

1145
00:46:59,482 --> 00:47:03,700
I think you were so concerned
with your dance steps

1146
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,079
and remembering
the choreography,

1147
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:09,010
yeah, that you were
losing the performance.

1148
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,424
You have a story to tell.

1149
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,355
Your drag is fierce.

1150
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,941
Make it work, because
you've got the goods.

1151
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,355
Thank you.

1152
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:18,079

1154
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,493
You look adorable.

1155
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:24,838

Austin Powers fembot moment.

1156
00:47:24,862 --> 00:47:26,113
Thank you.

1157
00:47:26,137 --> 00:47:27,976
In your fashion runway,
the nighttime look,

1158
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,217
there was a hole in the back.

1159
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:30,562
Was that meant for a tail?

1160
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:32,872
Yeah, it was supposed to be,
like, a panel.

1161
00:47:32,896 --> 00:47:35,286
I don't know.
A glory hole, girl?

1162
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,320
Well, I mean, it could be.

1163
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:40,596
Now, I want you to explain to me

1164
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,596
the thought process
behind that day look.

1165
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,665
When I was thinking, like,

1166
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:48,010
medieval, like,
mother of the hookers.

1167
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,251
But she's, like,
the head hooker.

1168
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:51,424
And, like, you know, like,

1169
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:52,700
she gives it to the girls,
and she gets the girls in check.

1170
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:53,666
In my head, it made sense.

1171
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,044
Uh-huh.

1172
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:57,872
The thing I'm obsessed with
about you

1173
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,458
is that, like, I never know

1174
00:47:59,482 --> 00:48:01,251
what you're gonna do next
or say next.

1175
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:02,631
Have you ever watched a TV show

1176
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:04,079
and not known
what the hell was going on,

1177
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:05,838
but you stay tuned
for episode two?

1178
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:07,458
95% of the time.

1179
00:48:07,482 --> 00:48:09,320
I don't even know
what you said, but, yes.

1180
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:13,769
That is something
that money can't buy,

1181
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,562
and it's your best attribute.

1182
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:17,182
Tonight in your performance,

1183
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:21,631
when you messed up your choreo,
don't let it show in your cara.

1184
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:23,458
Because the minute
that happened,

1185
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:26,320
we saw you going,
like, full-on panic.

1186
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,251
If you're in the front,
there's no mistakes

1187
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,079
unless you let us know
that it's going bad,

1188
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:31,355
you know what I mean?

1189
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:33,044
Thank you, Kandy.

1190
00:48:33,068 --> 00:48:35,148
Do-re-mi LaLa Ri.

1191
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:36,596
I did not love your day look,

1192
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,113
just because I thought
the colors looked kind of drab.

1193
00:48:38,137 --> 00:48:39,458
I loved your night look, though.

1194
00:48:39,482 --> 00:48:41,838
I'd like to go to the club
with that girl.

1195
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:43,665
I'd, of course, take
an Uber home about 10:45.

1196
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:44,769
She could stay out.

1197
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:52,251
This look here, you are
a motherfucking drag queen.

1198
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:53,389
It's 24-karat magic.

1199
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:56,734
And then in your performance,

1200
00:48:56,758 --> 00:48:59,596
what I loved
was your confidence.

1201
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,665
When you did your solo,

1202
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,148
I was like, I wonder
where she's from.

1203
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:04,320
And then you said Atlanta,

1204
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,941
I was like, yep,
she's from Atlanta.

1205
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:08,010
What clubs in Atlanta
do you work at?

1206
00:49:08,034 --> 00:49:10,079
Well, I actually work
at Lips Atlanta.

1207
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:12,562
I've worked at MSR.

1208
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,769
Of course I worked at the
Marquette, the Sleazy Queasy.

1209
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:16,493
The Marquette is still there?

1210
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:17,562
Oh, yes, girl,
it's still around,

1211
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,079
up and running and strong.

1212
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,010
You know, I used to go there
right after the Civil War.

1213
00:49:23,206 --> 00:49:24,941
- It's true.
- Yeah.

1214
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,872
There was some rough girls
up in there.

1215
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,655
Ooh.

1216
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:33,010
Up next, Olivia Lux.

1217
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:35,286
Tonight, I love
this old Hollywood glamour,

1218
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,907
and I love to see a queen
of color representing it.

1219
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:39,320
And I loved all your looks.

1220
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,217
I thought your daytime look
had a lot of whimsy,

1221
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:44,010
so I thought, okay,
she's got some humor in there.

1222
00:49:44,034 --> 00:49:46,803
You in the performance
was a joy to watch.

1223
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:49,700
The funny things that you did,
the little Mariah thing,

1224
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:53,872
you just owned that stage,
and that gets me so excited.

1225
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:55,424
And then you were smart,

1226
00:49:55,448 --> 00:49:59,044
because you wore this outfit
that had some fringe on it.

1227
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:01,217
That always just
enhances all the moves,

1228
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:05,562
and I saw somebody that
I could not take my eye off of.

1229
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,803
Thank you, Olivia.

1230
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:08,113
All right, Symone.

1231
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,665
This tonight was
a different approach to lamé.

1232
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:11,872
It's very smart.

1233
00:50:11,896 --> 00:50:13,941
I love the French braid.
Yeah, it works.

1234
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:15,596
- Thank you.
- The whole thing works.

1235
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,562
In the runway,
I lived for that day look.

1236
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:21,148
The look was hot.

1237
00:50:21,172 --> 00:50:22,907
- Thank you.
- And the night look,

1238
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,079
with the hair the way it was,
it was just right.

1239
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:26,389
Thank you.

1240
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:28,320
You're fierce,
you're filled with attitude,

1241
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:31,424
but you're not afraid
to go for it and be who you are.

1242
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,665
When you came out, you know
what I wrote down here?

1243
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:35,596
- What?
- I drew a star.

1244
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,044
Yeah.

1245
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,493
In the performance,
just the way you walked

1246
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:41,044
from that corner
to the center of the stage

1247
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:43,286
was like a spotlight
turned on you.

1248
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,655
Just right away, I was hooked.

1249
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:48,965
You've got star quality.

1250
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:52,562
You got it, kiddo.

1251
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:53,941
Thank you so much.

1252
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:55,562
Oh, my God, I can't...
Okay, thank you.

1253
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,803
Thank you.

1254
00:50:57,827 --> 00:50:59,389
Up next, Tina Burner.

1255
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:01,286
I thought your daytime look
was so fun.

1256
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,838
And the nighttime look

1257
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:04,734
was the perfect
naughty compliment to that.

1258
00:51:04,758 --> 00:51:06,355
Tonight, I'm really excited

1259
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:08,148
you're not wearing red,
orange, and yellow.

1260
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:10,596
You're paying homage
to Ru's favorite movie,

1261
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,389
The Wizard of Oz.

1262
00:51:12,413 --> 00:51:14,148
The ax purse,
the heart under there,

1263
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:16,320
it was all very smartly done.

1264
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:17,562
You pay attention to detail.

1265
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:18,596
Thank you.

1266
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,251
Your lip sync was well written,

1267
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:21,700
and you performed
the hell out of it.

1268
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,458
Not only that, I was really
shocked with the rap.

1269
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:24,700
You were in the pocket,

1270
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:27,769
and I think that
you are actually amazing.

1271
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,251
Thank you very much.

1272
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:30,527
One thing to remember.

1273
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:33,562
This is not a bar,
this is not a theater.

1274
00:51:33,586 --> 00:51:35,562
- Yeah.
- What this is... is TV,

1275
00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:37,010
so it's gonna be
a little bit different.

1276
00:51:37,034 --> 00:51:38,355
You can't turn as much,

1277
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:40,251
and remember,
the cameras are your friends.

1278
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,838
They're your lovers, darling.

1279
00:51:41,862 --> 00:51:44,079
I'm getting the poppers.
We're ready to go.

1280
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:48,355
That's good advice, and that's
good advice for all the girls.

1281
00:51:48,379 --> 00:51:50,424
- Poppers?
- Poppers, yes.

1282
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:55,424
Up next, Elliott with 2 Ts.

1283
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:58,527
So your day look was very French
and very beautiful.

1284
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:01,010
Your night look is what
I was in love with, however.

1285
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,907
I thought it was fantastic.

1286
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:04,217
Thank you.

1287
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:06,010
I loved how you looked
in the performance.

1288
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:08,286
The splits, that moment
was just, like, okay.

1289
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,389
Oh, she's that girl.

1290
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:11,562
When you guys were in the group,

1291
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,769
it felt like
you were just waiting.

1292
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:14,838
Like, I'm about to show,

1293
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:16,148
like when a bull's in the pen
and he's about to come out.

1294
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:17,458
And I was like,

1295
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,010
I wonder what this one's
about to do, you know?

1296
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:22,665
I've been thinking about
what it must feel like

1297
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,700
to stand in your heels
this week.

1298
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,907
Because
you could have been gone.

1299
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:28,424
- Yeah.
- And so if I were you,

1300
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:31,079
I would really have
something to prove this week,

1301
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,941
and I think you proved it.

1302
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:35,034
You deserve to be here.

1303
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,079
Thank you, Elliott.

1304
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,286
Thank you.

1305
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,596
Thank you, ladies.

1306
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,148
I think we've heard enough.

1307
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,838
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1308
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:47,310
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1309
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,769
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

1310
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,734
what do you think?

1311
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:54,838
Starting with Gottmik.

1312
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:57,458
Gottmik got style, got talent.

1313
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:00,562
That look was
so mind-blowing tonight.

1314
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:03,389
As soon as the performance
started and picked up,

1315
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,838
she got her stuff together.

1316
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,286
And I just wish

1317
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,148
that she could just own that
from the beginning.

1318
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,217
She's new to
the performance part of drag,

1319
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:12,286
so we've gotta see
if Gottmik is a queen

1320
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,320
that has that tool
in her tool belt as well.

1321
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:18,182
Kandy Muse, from the Bra-zonx.

1322
00:53:18,206 --> 00:53:20,941
I love that she has this body
positivity and shows it off,

1323
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:25,838
but I think the jury's still out
on the aesthetic.

1324
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:27,769
Kandy gives me
around the way girl,

1325
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:30,355
but a little rough
around the edges.

1326
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:33,389
Okay, yes, I get it,
the aesthetic's not great.

1327
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:35,182
And, like, I didn't understand
what she was saying

1328
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:36,182
when she was rapping.

1329
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,183
Ha!

1330
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:38,631
But can I keep her? Please?

1331
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,872
I love her!

1332
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:45,562
From Atlanta, Georgia, LaLa Ri.

1333
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:47,838
In the performance,
she had a control,

1334
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:50,217
and she knew what she was doing,
and I bought every second of it.

1335
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:53,872
LaLa Ri knows how to perform,
and she's ready to bring it.

1336
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:56,527
I cannot wait
to see what LaLa Ri does.

1337
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:57,803
She's exciting.

1338
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:59,286
Olivia Lux.

1339
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,562
Olivia reminds me
of the First Lady.

1340
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:02,596
Faith Evans?

1341
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,113
More on the Michelle Obama tip,

1342
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:07,079
but still, you get the idea.

1343
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,148
She gives me that.

1344
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:09,941
And then the performance,

1345
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:11,527
I have to say Beyoncé.

1346
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,596
- Yeah.
- You know, she had the class,

1347
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,148
and she showed up
and she showed out.

1348
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:18,320
And she is so beautiful
and charming.

1349
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:19,665
I see that smile,

1350
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,182
and it's like, oh, her.
I love her.

1351
00:54:22,206 --> 00:54:23,665
Symone.

1352
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:24,976
I know that Jamal said

1353
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,389
that Kandy Muse is like
an around the way girl,

1354
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:27,665
- but so's Symone.
- Yeah.

1355
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:28,803
She came out
and she struck a pose,

1356
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:29,838
and she tilted her head
to the side.

1357
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:31,217
Like, I can't even do it

1358
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:33,148
because my neck roll
won't let me do it.

1359
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:35,010
But she just, like,
just stood and did that,

1360
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:38,458
and I thought, this bitch
has got that energy,

1361
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:39,700
that confidence.

1362
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:42,148
Symone scared me
when I first saw her.

1363
00:54:43,206 --> 00:54:44,596
Just to be honest.

1364
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,734
And then with her runway look,

1365
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:48,562
that kind of just said
everything about her.

1366
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:51,527
Like, I'm gonna fight all
the way to the finish, you know?

1367
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:53,355
And that's the spirit
that I get from her.

1368
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:54,596
Tina Burner.

1369
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,044
I was a little concerned

1370
00:54:56,068 --> 00:54:59,700
when I kept seeing
those same orange/red/yellow.

1371
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:01,251
I'm, like, having a flashback

1372
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:03,113
to my eighth birthday party
at McDonald's, right?

1373
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:05,355
And I was thinking, okay,

1374
00:55:05,379 --> 00:55:08,113
let's rein those colors in
a little bit.

1375
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,700
And she did
right at the right time.

1376
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,320
I thought that
was the smartest thing

1377
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:12,734
she could have done this week.

1378
00:55:12,758 --> 00:55:15,700
I know her from New York City,
and I have to say,

1379
00:55:15,724 --> 00:55:18,803
Tina has been living up
to the Tina Burner hype.

1380
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:22,596
I think that she's got things
that she's gonna have to...

1381
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,079
- Adjust?
- Yeah.

1382
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:26,113
I see Tina here to play.

1383
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,872
I was pleasantly surprised
in her performance,

1384
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:31,113
and I think that
she has what it takes

1385
00:55:31,137 --> 00:55:33,113
to go all the way, actually.

1386
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,665
Elliott with 2 Ts.

1387
00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:37,700
She came out here
to prove something,

1388
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:38,769
and I think that's
what I picked up on.

1389
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,631
She was so excited,

1390
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:41,769
she kind of
got out of the element.

1391
00:55:41,793 --> 00:55:43,424
We can see that she's got it.

1392
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:44,631
We see that she can do it.

1393
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,458
And if she just
relaxes into it...

1394
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:47,872
I know
we've all heard that before.

1395
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:49,734
You gotta want it.

1396
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:51,355
You gotta want it.

1397
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:53,458
It's gotta be tough
to be Elliott this week.

1398
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:57,700
I think I must have ESPN,
because I was looking,

1399
00:55:57,724 --> 00:56:00,182
I was, like, there's
something going on with her.

1400
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:01,596
And it was true.

1401
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,217
But I could tell
that the talent's there.

1402
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:05,148
I can tell that
she can serve a look.

1403
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:07,458
I love Elliott with 2 Ts'
aesthetic,

1404
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:11,286
because it's very Exposé,
the group Exposé,

1405
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,907
for those of you who don't know.

1406
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:18,182
But it's quirky, and I love
that aspect of her presentation.

1407
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:19,838
E-S-P-N. Got it.

1408
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:26,665
Silence! I've made my decision.

1409
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:29,872
Bring back my girls.

1410
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,631
Welcome back, ladies.

1411
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,217
Based on your performances

1412
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:42,700
in the fashion show
and on the main stage,

1413
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,482
I've made some decisions.

1414
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:48,631
Olivia Lux.

1415
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,206
Symone.

1416
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:54,493
Con-drag-ulations.

1417
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:56,182
You are the top two queens
of the week.

1418
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:59,320
Aah!

1419
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:03,493
Darling, I am on top of the
motherfucking world, bitch.

1420
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:05,320
I'm a real competitor in this.

1421
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:06,700
And now the girls know it.

1422
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,182
They don't see me
as a threat, right?

1423
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:10,389
Thank you!

1424
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:11,793
Thank you!

1425
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:14,413
The rest of you...

1426
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:20,310
are safe.

1427
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:26,562
This week, there are
no bottoms, only tops.

1428
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:30,631
Well, with the exception of
the judges' panel, of course.

1429
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:35,217
You may step
to the back of the stage.

1430
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,493
I thought I was lip syncing
against Kandy,

1431
00:57:36,517 --> 00:57:38,907
and I love Kandy,

1432
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:41,044
so I just feel so relieved.

1433
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:42,941
We're all staying,

1434
00:57:42,965 --> 00:57:45,085
and I cannot get to the back
of the stage fast enough.

1435
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:51,838
Olivia Lux, Symone,
great job this week,

1436
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:56,448
but there can only be
one number one.

1437
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:00,389
Two queens stand before me.

1438
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:05,596
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1439
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:10,448
and win a cash tip of $5,000.

1440
00:58:12,172 --> 00:58:13,872
Oh, my God.

1441
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:16,527
The time has come...

1442
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:19,596
for you to lip sync...

1443
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,793
for the win.

1444
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:27,527
This is when you
leave it all on the stage.

1445
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:31,907
I'm going to attack it
with everything that I have,

1446
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:34,148
coiffed and updo and all.

1447
00:58:34,172 --> 00:58:40,217

Ladies, I've made my decision.

1495
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:05,803
Symone.

1496
01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:06,976
You're a winner, baby.

1497
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:11,252
Thank you!

1498
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:12,665
Con-drag-ulations.

1499

has taken the bag.

1503
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:23,976
I am feeling great.

1504
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,700

are just around the corner.

01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:40,034
But this one thing
I know is true.

1508
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:44,182
If you can't love yourself,

1509
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:46,941
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1510
01:01:46,965 --> 01:01:49,217
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1511
01:01:49,241 --> 01:01:51,044
- Amen!
- Amen!

1512
01:01:51,068 --> 01:01:53,665
