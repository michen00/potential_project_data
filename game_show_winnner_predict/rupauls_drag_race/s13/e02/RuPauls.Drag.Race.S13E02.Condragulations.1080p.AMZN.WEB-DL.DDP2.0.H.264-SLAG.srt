RuPaul: Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

00:00:08,206 --> 00:00:10,320
For the first time
inDrag Race herstory,

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,458
we're kicking off the season

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:16,586
with six lip syncs
for your lives.

5
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,700
Bitch, excuse me?

6
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:23,700
Kandy Muse, LaLa Ri,
Symone, Gottmik,

7
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:26,424
Olivia Lux, Tina Burner,
shantay you stay.

8
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:29,044
Aah!

9
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:34,424
Joey Jay, Denali,
Tamisha Iman, Utica, Rosé,

10
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,044
Kahmora Hall, and Elliott,

11
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:38,689
that means you're
getting the porkchop.

12
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:44,113
Here we all are
in the porkchop lounge,

13
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,562
who famously went home first.

14
00:00:46,586 --> 00:00:48,251
Is that what's gonna happen
to all of us?

15
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:50,562
[bells play]

16
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:52,493
RuPaul: Attention, Queens.

17
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:57,493
You all have a chance
to return to the competition.

18
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:04,034
But first, you must give one
of your fellow queens the chop.

19
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,758
Let the voting begin.

20
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:13,458
Wait, for real-real?

21
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:14,665
How do... what?

22
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:15,907
This is fucked.

23
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:17,458
This is...

24
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,320
crazy.

25
00:01:19,344 --> 00:01:20,734
We all have a chance to stay,

26
00:01:20,758 --> 00:01:22,734
but we have to vote
one of the girls in the room

27
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:24,424
out the competition.

28
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:25,425
That becomes overwhelming.

29
00:01:25,449 --> 00:01:28,217
What are we going to do?

30
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:30,769
I don't wanna vote anyone off.
I don't know any of you yet.

31
00:01:30,793 --> 00:01:32,320
We literally just met.

32
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:33,700
None of us saw
each other's lip syncs.

33
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,010
I don't know how to pick.

34
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:36,148
I mean, the only thing
we know about each other

35
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:37,182
is our first impression.

36
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,803
We have to vote someone off.

37
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,424
This is a competition.

38
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,355
This is what we signed up for.

39
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,172
All right, bitches,
shit about to go down.

40
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,389
Each individual girl
has to walk up to the box,

41
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:57,803
select the lipstick with
one of the girls' names on it,

42
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,769
and drop it in the box.

43
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:02,872
If we're going off
of first impressions,

44
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,458
I don't know you, sis,
but where's the look?

45
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:09,769
I don't see wow factor.

46
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:12,320
I hate to be the shallow bitch,

47
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:13,803
but I'm just not a fan
of chicken feathers.

48
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:17,734
Kahmora and myself, we're
both in ostrich feathers,

49
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,217
and she's in
the lower-quality feathers.

50
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,758
So sorry, girl, gotta go.

51
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,631
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo,

52
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,758
Utica, you gotta go.

53
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:30,769
It sucks to have to vote.

54
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:32,562
I don't wanna crush
somebody's dream,

55
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,527
and I definitely do not
want my dream to be crushed.

56
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:37,862
I'm scared that
I could be voted out.

57
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,872
[bells play]

58
00:02:55,896 --> 00:03:00,251
Attention, queens
in the porkchop loading dock.

59
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,596
The votes are in!

60
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,448
We have a tie...

61
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:13,700
Between Elliott with 2 Ts

62
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:17,907
and Utica.

63
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,458
Let the tie-breaker
voting round begin.

64
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:21,862
Oh, no.

65
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:25,079
We have to do a tie-breaker.

66
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:29,000
This time, we can only vote
between Utica and Elliott.

67
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:32,424
I'm trying to fight
for this crown,

68
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:36,320
and I feel like my dream
is slowly fading away.

69
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:39,734
As each queen goes up
and chooses again,

70
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,907
my heart just drops
lower and lower

71
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,251
as the queens pick theirs.

72
00:03:43,275 --> 00:03:45,724
I'm just dreading the worst.

73
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,320
[bells play]

74
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:58,217
RuPaul: The votes are in!

75
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:03,896
The queen that's getting
the first chop is...

76
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:08,206
Elliott with 2 Ts.

77
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:13,286
All righty, then.

78
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,941
Pblblblbl.

79
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,700
It's been a lovely 15 minutes
with all of you.

80
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:21,389
I'm disappointed
that it ended like this,

81
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:24,872
because I got sent home
for something

82
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:30,010
that I didn't have any say in
or any power over,

83
00:04:30,034 --> 00:04:32,631
and that sucks.

84
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,010
And I feel like
I've let my fiancé down,

85
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:37,551
and I'm 100% heartbroken.

86
00:04:40,344 --> 00:04:42,907
Oh, my God.

87
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:46,320
Unfortunately, we had
to vote somebody out,

88
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:47,769
and it was Elliott.

89
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:51,010
And while that's sad,
it's also a joyous occasion,

90
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,320
because the less people here,
the closer I am to the crown.

91
00:04:54,344 --> 00:04:55,655

- All right!
- Okay?

103
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,976
It's a new day.
Last week was crazy.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,148
The twists and turns.

105
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,148
I still don't even know
what's going on.

106

- Day. It's official.
- It's official.

109
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:41,493
After all that craziness,
bitch, well...

110
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:42,976
Hello, winner's circle.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,010
- Hello!
- Hey!

112
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,251
Hello, winners.

113
00:05:45,275 --> 00:05:47,113
There's high expectations
now for us,

114
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,182
now that we won this lip sync.

115
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:49,596
Yeah. Tea.

116
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,907
I wonder if we're gonna
get to meet the other girls.

117
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:53,148
We already sent them home.
That's it.

118
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:54,389
And if they're saved,

119
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:56,148
we went through that
on our first day,

120
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:58,389
- that's shady.
- I know, and if they're back,

121
00:05:58,413 --> 00:06:00,182
they're gonna have
a vengeance, mama.

122
00:06:00,206 --> 00:06:01,838
If for whatever reason
they happen to come back,

123
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,251
it's us against them,
because it's top six,

124
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,286
the winner's circle, and
they can't take that from us.

125
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,113
- That's it.
- I wanna see some bitches fight.

126
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:08,286
You gotta go.

127
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,941
I'm ready for you to fight,
bitch.

128
00:06:09,965 --> 00:06:11,182
[gasps] Not me!

129
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:13,044
Okay, all from Brooklyn.

130
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,217
Bitches already think
I'm causing trouble,

131
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,458
and I'm just here
to be a good girl.

132
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:16,838
- You are causing trouble, Kandy!
- Oh, girl.

133
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,217
Kandy, you walk in the room
and cause trouble.

134
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,424
You Captain Trouble, honey.

135
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:24,286
In New York, Kandy is known
to be like cunty and bitchy,

136
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,044
and, like, trying
to literally cause drama.

137
00:06:27,068 --> 00:06:28,527
It's just not my tea, sis.

138
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,907
We'll see. We shall see, ladies.

139
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:31,941
[alarm]

140
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,596

141
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,355
She done already
done had herses.

142
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,113
Woman's calling us.

143
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:42,355
My queens, con-drag-ulations.

144
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:45,976
I wanna thank you
for a job well done.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,320
But now is the time to guard

146
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:51,907
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

147
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:55,482
from the fickle finger of fate.

148
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:58,907
I don't think I know
those words. [laughs]

149
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:01,872
What the hell
does that shit mean?

150
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:04,424
Hello, hello, hello!

151
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:07,458
[cheers and applause]

152
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,182
You better come on in this suit.

153
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:12,596
Racers, welcome
to RuPaul's Drag Race.

154
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,700
How do you like
the season so far?

155
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,631
- Crazy.
- [laughs]

156
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:17,976
Well, this week,

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,872
you can all take a deep breath
and just relax.

158
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:24,838
Oh, who am I kidding? [laughs]

159
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,010
That's never gonna happen.

160
00:07:27,034 --> 00:07:30,700
Now, before we get
to know you officially,

161
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:34,113
I wanna introduce you
to a fabulous queen

162
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,769
who'll be joining you
in the competition.

163
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:38,182
Uh-uh.

164
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,458
That's right,
someone I don't think

165
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:43,182
got a fair chance last week.

166
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:46,965
And I think she'll fit in
with this group just right.

167
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,907
Hello!

168
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,769
- Oh!
- Oh!

169
00:07:54,793 --> 00:07:59,631
Guess who's back
in the house? Yeah. [laughs]

170
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:02,665
This little angel twink
walks in.

171
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,872
I have no idea who it is,
but I'm gagged.

172
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:08,182
Elliott with 2 Ts.

173
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:09,596
I thought I sent you home.

174
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,389
We told you this season
would be full of surprises.

175
00:08:12,413 --> 00:08:13,803
What the hell?

176
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,182
Why do you get to come back
into the competition

177
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,803
if you weren't one of the girls

178
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,448
that won their lip sync
during the first week?

179
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:25,493
What the fuck?
I sent that bitch packing.

180
00:08:25,517 --> 00:08:27,803
What's going on?
Why is she back?

181
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:30,941
And what did she do
to get back here?

182
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:33,355
You smell that? It's distrust.

183
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,389
Hey, Elliott.

184
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,596
Hello.

185
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,803
You went through it last week,

186
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:39,320
but you are back
to prove once again

187
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,734
that losing is the new winning.

188
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,769
#DragRace.

189
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,079
[all chuckle]

190
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,355
Now, I want you all
to really hear this.

191
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:51,010
No queen is a loser
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

192
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:55,286
Victoria "Porkchop" Parker
was the very first queen

193
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,424
to ever be eliminated
on RuPaul's Drag Race

194
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:00,458
13 years ago.

195
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:03,803
And today,
she is a living legend.

196
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,838
Just ask anyone
at the Golden Corral.

197
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:07,562
[all laugh]

198
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:10,113
Now, Shangela and Vanjie

199
00:09:10,137 --> 00:09:12,251
were the first eliminated
from their seasons,

200
00:09:12,275 --> 00:09:17,734
only to return and reach new
heights of international fame.

201
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,044
That's the tea.

202
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:22,079
Racers, you signed up
for a competition.

203
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,217
Queens will be eliminated.

204
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:27,458
But the moral
of this fairy tale is simple.

205
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:31,596
No matter what happens here,
out there, or online,

206
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,941
don't let anyone
make you feel like a loser.

207
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:36,941
Amen.

208
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:37,942
You know why?

209
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:39,700
Because you're a winner, baby.

210
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:42,320
Aah!

211
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:43,321
So let's get started.

212
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,562
All right.

213
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:46,458
Time to test
your fashion skills.

214
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:49,320
For your first mini-challenge,

215
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:53,907
you need to stomp the runway
in two devastating looks.

216
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:56,355
First, a ladylike daytime look,

217
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,044
and second,
a vampy nighttime look

218
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:01,734
that says, "I'm a whore."

219
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,769
Can you pull that off?

220
00:10:03,793 --> 00:10:05,941
Every day.

221
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:09,010
Okay, Glamazons,
I'll see you on the runway.

222
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,596
Let's go.

223
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,251
- Oh, yeah!
- [laughs]

224
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:15,803
You bitch! You're a linebacker.

225
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:20,872
Our first mini-challenge
is a sickening runway show.

226
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:23,700
My soul has completely
returned to my body.

227
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,113
I'm ready to compete.

228
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:26,872
Girl, I get to
pull out my looks.

229
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:28,838
I get to model. Let's do it!

230
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,182
Cue the music, let's go!

231
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:34,493
Oh! Oh, my God, I'm living
my mirror fantasy!

232
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:36,286
I've always dreamt

233
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,976
about getting ready
in these werkroom mirrors.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,769
It's making me so excited.

235
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:45,217
I totally feel like the real
competition is about to start.

236
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,655
Start your engines, bitch.

237
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,527
Ooh, the melanin girls
on this side.

238
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,148
- Oh, yes!
- Hello!

239
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:54,769
Brown girl power.

240
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,596
So how y'all feeling

241
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,803
about having a new bitch
in the competition?

242
00:10:57,827 --> 00:10:59,217
The new girl?
I'm a little baffled,

243
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,941
because I liked the top six
from the beginning.

244
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:01,976
I thought it was
a cute moment, too,

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,148
but we should have known.

246
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,596
Bitch, what are you here to do?

247
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,010
Are you spying on us?

248
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,217
Bitch, RuPaul's set the bar.
She thinks she's slick.

249
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:11,389
But I already caught on
to her game.

250
00:11:11,413 --> 00:11:12,700
Tina, how you feeling,

251
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,596
because you sent
Miss Elliott home, correct?

252
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,044
Well, we obviously know that
you can send somebody home,

253
00:11:17,068 --> 00:11:18,355
and here they are.

254
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,113
[all laugh] All right.

255
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,458
- You never know!
- You never know.

256
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,251
I do not trust Elliott.

257
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,803
Elliott the spy, honey.

258
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:28,907
Well, keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

259
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:31,379
Guess who I painted next to?
Elliott.

260
00:11:34,965 --> 00:11:36,941
Isn't it so crazy to think,
like, you're a Ru girl?

261
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:38,734
- Ru girl, right, bitch?
- You're a Ru girl!

262
00:11:38,758 --> 00:11:41,079
Kandy Muse, you've been
saying you're a Ru girl

263
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:43,458
for the last six years,
so I don't wanna hear it.

264
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,596
People called me
an adjacent Ru girl before this,

265
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,079
but that's because
a lot of my drag family

266
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:49,907
has been on Drag Racebefore.

267
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,872
Aja's my drag mother
and Dahlia's my drag sister,

268
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,458
so I walk into things
thinking I'm already famous.

269
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:55,700
[all laugh]

270
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,355
So I may not be a Ru girl
before this,

271
00:11:58,379 --> 00:11:59,596
but I'm gonna walk in there
like I am a Ru girl.

272
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,803
You gonna think I'm a Ru girl.

273
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:02,493
But I have a question.

274
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,596
It's something that I've noticed
a lot in the past seasons.

275
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,044
When girls come in

276
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:08,769
and they instantly say,
"Oh, my mom was on this season,"

277
00:12:08,793 --> 00:12:11,010
whatever, this season,
they usually go home early.

278
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,148
- Oh?
- Oh?

279
00:12:13,172 --> 00:12:14,389
Do you think
that's gonna affect you?

280
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,872
- No.
- No?

281
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:19,907
First of all, bitch,
who is talking to you?

282
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:23,286
Second of all, girl,
I don't even know you.

283
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,631
You done just walked
into the werkroom, okay?

284
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:27,217
Because, like, Vanjie came in
and was, like,

285
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,389
"I'm Alexis Mateo's daughter,"
went home.

286
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,838
Dahlia, "I'm Aja's daughter,"
went home.

287
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,527
Like, it's weird.
It's interesting to me.

288
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,217
You better break the mold, sis.

289
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:39,872
Elliott walks in here
first time de-dragging

290
00:12:39,896 --> 00:12:42,113
just snapping like that,

291
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:44,700
like, I think she is here
to serve possible bitch.

292
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:46,976
"Aren't you worried that
your sister went home first

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,803
and you could go home first?"

294
00:12:48,827 --> 00:12:52,079
You might wanna come down
with that, Elliott with 2 Ts.

295
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,769
There ain't no girl I would
just, like, come for her

296
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:56,389
if I don't know her.

297
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,896
[Elliott laughs]

298
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,596
Ooh.

299
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,862
Uh-huh.

300
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,665
I know it, because
he was getting to you.

301
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:08,907
- I felt it.
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:12,458
Girl, you just walked in here.

303
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,458
I don't know if
Miss Elliott with 2 Ts

304
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:17,148
wants to prove to the other
girls that she's a big, bad wolf

305
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,044
because she just
walked into this competition,

306
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:20,769
but I'm gonna do
what I'm gonna do,

307
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:22,596
and that's focus on me.

308
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,044
Because the pressure's
definitely on,

309
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:26,251
because my sister Dahlia
went home first on Season 12,

310
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,493
and I don't wanna
repeat history.

311
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,517
So, no, ma'am.

312
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,458
RuPaul: Coming up...

313
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:35,872
Category is Nighttime
Is The Right Time.

314
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:38,700
The bitch has arrived
at the party, honey.

315
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,010
Bitch!

316
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:41,562
I know you did not just trip.

317
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:42,803
What in the hell?

318
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:44,137
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

319
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:48,172
[RuPaul laughs]

320
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:59,010
Category is Daytime Drama, Mama.

321
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,655
Fashion!

322
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:03,113
First up, Gottmik.

323
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:07,907
She's your weather girl,
and has she got news for you.

324
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,872
Gottmik: My daytime look
represents my drag style,

325
00:14:09,896 --> 00:14:13,044
because it's
a fitted latex number,

326
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,734
oversized shoulders,
structured hair,

327
00:14:15,758 --> 00:14:17,976
but with a girlie twist.

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,286
O-M-G, we match, we're rainbros.

329
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,872
It's cutesy, and I feel
like a little princess

330
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,044
in the middle of the day.

331
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,182
I'm normally intense
with my looks,

332
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,079
and I usually paint my face
clown white.

333
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,320
So, hello, showing them
range already.

334
00:14:32,344 --> 00:14:35,941
RuPaul:
A 100% chance of gorgeous.

335
00:14:35,965 --> 00:14:38,665
I'm gonna say everything
like Don Adams.

336
00:14:38,689 --> 00:14:39,632
[imitating Don Adams]
Would you believe

337
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,769
100% chance of gorgeous?

338
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:45,251
Kandy Muse. Rock me, Mama-deus.

339
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,665
Ross: Mama-deus? Mama-deus?

340
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:47,872
Kandy: I am excited
to walk the runway,

341
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,596
because this is what I do.

342
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,424
Baby, I've been modeling in
the fucking streets of New York

343
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:53,596
my entire life.

344
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,010
Bitch, I might pretend

345
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,251
I'm walking down
a fashion show in Paris.

346
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:58,562
I'm just like...

347
00:14:58,586 --> 00:14:59,838
even though I'm in the hood.

348
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:01,458
But it's fine,
it's cool, I love it.

349
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:05,010
This looks isn't necessarily
a classic Kandy look,

350
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,631
but I'm trying
to show the judges

351
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,493
that a big girl
can be fashion-forward.

352
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:09,769
So I'm gonna give you couture.

353
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:12,596
RuPaul: The Red Queen.
Off with her head!

354
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,286
Do-re-mi, LaLa Ri.

355
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,872
Ooh, the braid of it all.

356
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:18,873
Michelle: She's part
of the braidy bunch.

357
00:15:18,897 --> 00:15:20,148
RuPaul: Okay.

358
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:21,493
LaLa: Miss LaLa Ri is giving you

359
00:15:21,517 --> 00:15:22,941
very Southern belle tease.

360
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,734
I'm in the field
with a glass of lemonade.

361
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,907
You know, she got her braids
cocked to the side,

362
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:28,113
and she swish it back
for the boys to see.

363
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:29,665
You know, hey, how you doing?

364
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,493
I'm walking down the runway,
living my best life,

365
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:33,217
and then boom, bitch,

366
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:35,389
I trip over all
this extra-ass fabric.

367
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,182
I'm like, bitch!

368
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:40,769
I know you did not just trip
on these good people's runway.

369
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:42,044
But don't fall, ho.

370
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:44,872
Do not fall. And I did not fall.

371
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,286
Michelle: She going back
to the secret garden.

372
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,750
- Okay.
- Put the petal to the metal.

373
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:51,700
RuPaul: Olivia Lux.

374
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,527
Michelle: She looks at life
through lilac-colored glasses.

375
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:56,769
RuPaul: I prefer
Rose Nylund glasses.

376
00:15:56,793 --> 00:16:01,113
Olivia: This daytime drag
is flirty fashion.

377
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:05,320
She's walking down Fifth
Avenue without a care in the world,

378
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,631
and she has
her weekend bag in hand.

379
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:09,872
Everything she needs
for the weekend.

380
00:16:09,896 --> 00:16:12,286
You know, you can tell
a lot about a queen

381
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,596
by the size of her purse.

382
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,527
When I walk,
the ponytail's going, like...

383
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:16,976
[humming]

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,907
I'm living
this lavender fantasy.

385
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:23,458
RuPaul: Olivia Lux.
She has no Lux left to give.

386
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,700
[all laugh]

387
00:16:24,724 --> 00:16:26,700
Ladies and gentlemen, Symone.

388
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,941
Ross: The circus is in town,
and she's the big top.

389
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:31,286
Michelle:
Well, that makes one of us.

390
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,355
RuPaul: There's gotta be
at least one.

391
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,320
Symone: My look,
inspired by the nineties,

392
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,113
with player's club hair.

393
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,251
My shoulders out,
a little peek-a-boo,

394
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:40,596
and then you turn around
and boom,

395
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,113
there's a cape
in the back, honey.

396
00:16:43,137 --> 00:16:46,941
A little bit of old meets new,
which is very Symone.

397
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,389
Giving you everything.

398
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:52,044
RuPaul: Symone Pointer,
the last Pointer Sister.

399
00:16:52,068 --> 00:16:53,872
Tina Burner.

400
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:55,493
Ross: She got my kettle boiling.

401
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,838
Tina: In my daytime look,

402
00:16:56,862 --> 00:16:58,803
I'm living
my Carrie Bradshaw fantasy

403
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:02,182
in, like, a tutu,
but, like, fitted Dior top.

404
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:03,665
I got a big-ass bow.

405
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,044
People are gonna bow down,
honey.

406
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:08,389
Bow, bow.
Is that spelled the same?

407
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:10,838
Oh, my God, it is!
Bow down to my bow.

408
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:12,803
RuPaul: I gotta get me
a Burner phone.

409
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:14,803
I do, yeah.

410
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:16,286
Tina Burner phone.

411
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,286
Elliott with 2 Ts.

412
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,044
I wonder if she got
that raspberry beret

413
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:21,217
at a second-hand store?

414
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,596
[all laugh]

415
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,941
I do know she came in
through the out door.

416
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:26,286
[laughs]

417
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,803
Elliott: Getting to do
two runway looks

418
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,217
is so exciting,
because I get to show

419
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:33,010
why I was given
a second chance to be here.

420
00:17:33,034 --> 00:17:35,562
And girl, I'm so ready.

421
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:38,010
[laughs]

422
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:39,011
[snorts]

423
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,758
RuPaul: And fancy was her name.

424
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:48,596
Category is Nighttime
Is The Right Time.

425
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,976
I told you twice the first time.

426
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,113
[all laugh]

427
00:17:53,137 --> 00:17:55,493
First up, Gottmik.

428
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,941
Now, is it me, or does she
look a little pasty?

429
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:59,044
[Michelle laughs]

430
00:17:59,068 --> 00:18:00,355
Gottmik: This look, oh,

431
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,044
she's gonna steal your soul.

432
00:18:02,068 --> 00:18:06,148
She is a spooky-ductress,

433
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,596
and, girl, my titty's out.

434
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,734
Ever since I got my top surgery,

435
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,389
I love having my chest out,
let me tell you that.

436
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,458
I am living for it,

437
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,251
and I never want
this feeling to go away.

438
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,734
RuPaul: Must get moose
and squirrel.

439
00:18:19,758 --> 00:18:20,758
Michelle: Natasha.

440
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,976
RuPaul: Kandy Muse.

441
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,596
Ross: What in the hell?

442
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,665
Kandy: This look
definitely represents

443
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,079
a little more Kandy Muse,

444
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:31,355
because I love latex,
I love being sexy,

445
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,562
I love showing body,
I love showing curves.

446
00:18:33,586 --> 00:18:36,148
It's just everything, bitch.
I'm everything.

447
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:38,734
Michelle: She gets her kicks
on Route 666.

448
00:18:38,758 --> 00:18:41,172
[all laugh]

449
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:44,251
Michelle: The hole.

450
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,665
Is that for a tail, you think?

451
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,320
Not today, Satan.

452
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:50,896
[all laugh]

453
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,044
RuPaul: Do-re-mi for LaLa Ri.

454
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,286
Michelle: Salt-n-Peplum.

455
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,287
RuPaul: Yes.

456
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,665
LaLa: Baby, that look,

457
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:03,389
I'm not over-over-the-top
drag girl.

458
00:19:03,413 --> 00:19:06,389
But whatever I give you,
I'm going to sell it.

459
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,458
They say give you whore,
I'm gonna give you whore.

460
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,872
Ass out, titties out, pleather.

461
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,286
Not leather, 'cause
a bitch can't afford it.

462
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:17,010
But, bitch, I'm still serving it
like it's leather, girl.

463
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:18,011
I live for this look.

464
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:19,700
Ross: Honey, be the chain

465
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,182
you wanna see in the world.

466
00:19:21,206 --> 00:19:22,976
RuPaul: Olivia Lux.

467
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,700
Oh. This time
she packed her big bag.

468
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:26,734
[Michelle laughs]

469
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:28,424
Olivia: I'm really excited

470
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:29,769
to flip the script

471
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,424
and be this mysterious
mistress of the night.

472
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:35,148
I don't normally do dark hair,

473
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:38,424
but something about
this rich chocolate brown

474
00:19:38,448 --> 00:19:40,320
against that
glittering burgundy,

475
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:43,527
a night at the opera, perhaps.

476
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:47,148
RuPaul: Trend alert.
Teeny, tiny handbags.

477
00:19:47,172 --> 00:19:48,355
Teeny, teeny, tiny.

478
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:49,493
RuPaul: She packed
an overnight bag.

479
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:50,872
Michelle: All she needs
are her panties.

480
00:19:50,896 --> 00:19:52,596
[all laugh] Tee-hee!

481
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,355
RuPaul: Symone. Yes, honey.

482
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:58,734
Ooh, is the bus still running?
[all laugh]

483
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:01,355
Symone: The bitch has arrived
at the party, honey,

484
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,838
Let's go.

485
00:20:02,862 --> 00:20:06,251
For evening, Symone is
giving you very Mother Goddess

486
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:09,562
combined with
the last people in the matrix

487
00:20:09,586 --> 00:20:10,941
partying and dying, darling.

488
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,700
Michelle: Get this side.
It's my good side.

489
00:20:12,724 --> 00:20:13,701
Ross: Oh, every angle.

490
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:15,527
[all laugh]

491
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:16,528
RuPaul: Ooh, it looks like
she started

492
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:18,872
the walk of shame early.

493
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:20,700
Michelle: See you
next Symone day.

494
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:22,458
RuPaul: Tina Burner.

495
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,665
What's latex got to do with it?

496
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,493
Michelle:
All her exes live in latexes.

497
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:29,872
Tina:
I'm letting the judges know

498
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,562
that I not only can be
a costume comedy queen,

499
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:37,389
but I can be a sexy seductress,
fun party girl.

500
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:41,113
My boots are up to my pussy,
and I am swinging my hair,

501
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,458
trying not to throw my neck out

502
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:43,527
because I'm old.

503
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,458
I'm serving you my red claws,

504
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:46,734
because she's gonna claw
the competition.

505
00:20:46,758 --> 00:20:50,458
RuPaul: Tina Burner,
available only on vinyl.

506
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,389
Something wicked this way comes.

507
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:55,631
Elliott with 2 Ts.

508
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,320
Ross: Michelle's been good,
but I've been bad.

509
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,700
[all laugh]

510
00:21:00,724 --> 00:21:03,769
Elliott: This look right here
is out of the box for Elliott.

511
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:08,838
It is dark and mysterious
and just sex.

512
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,286
This look is what you see

513
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,872
when you go to the
gentleman's club on a fetish night.

514
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:14,839
And don't get too close to her.

515
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:16,700
She might whip you, honey.

516
00:21:16,724 --> 00:21:18,562
Michelle:
And, poof, there she goes.

517
00:21:18,586 --> 00:21:20,700
Well, that's it. Show's over.

518
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:22,286
My car is here.

519
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,976
- Oh.
- Bye.

520
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,286
Is the bus still running?

521
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,113
Yeah, can I borrow
a little change?

522
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,665
Yeah, I gotcha.

523
00:21:28,689 --> 00:21:30,079
RuPaul: Coming up...

524
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:31,941
I'm still gagged Miss Thing
came for me earlier.

525
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:34,527
I already feel like I'm
the red-headed stepsister.

526
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:35,700
That's strike one.

527
00:21:35,724 --> 00:21:37,217
Bitch, strike two, you out.

528
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:38,286
Oh, here we go.
It's starting early.

529
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,976
Oh, my.

530
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,137
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

531
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,217
[RuPaul laughs]

532
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,976
Oh, my God.

533
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,424
Jesus!

534
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:51,562
That was everything.

535
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,148
Oh, bitch, oh, oh, oh.

536
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:54,769
My feet hurt so bad.

537
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,596
We're back in the werkroom,
and I'm looking around the room,

538
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,596
and everyone brought it
for the fashion show, bitch.

539
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,148
I'm kind of gagged.

540
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:03,113
I feel real confident,
I feel real good.

541
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:05,010
Can't wait
for that maxi-challenge.

542
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,872
We gonna see what happens.

543
00:22:06,896 --> 00:22:09,389
Get this hair up off me, Lord.

544
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,424
Take it off, take it off,
take it...

545
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,803
- Ahh, feel that.
- Oh, Lord.

546
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,355
That's better than sex, honey.

547
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,700
Can someone get my hair
outta my dress?

548
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:18,182
Thank you, dude.

549
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,286
Ooh. Ugh!

550
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,700
[laughs]

551
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:23,148
Bitch, it's like
a steamed hamhog.

552
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:26,000
What the hell
is a "hamhog?" [laughs]

553
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,424
I just wanna hose myself down.

554
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,631
Oh, she's on brand.
Hose, fire hose, firemen.

555
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:34,148
- Oh, come on!
- Tina Burner! [laughs]

556
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:36,010
Oh, here we go, here we go.
It's starting early.

557
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,700
Girl, I'm still so gagged
Miss Thing came for me earlier.

558
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:39,941
Miss New Girl on the Block?

559
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:41,320
Miss 2 Ts over there.

560
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:42,907
Mother hen got comfortable
real fast, girl.

561
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:44,734
Real fast, and that's
the thing, though.

562
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:46,769
Like, I respect everyone,
I give everyone a fair chance.

563
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:48,044
But if you're trying
to come for me

564
00:22:48,068 --> 00:22:49,251
and I'm on the other side
of the room

565
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:50,734
minding my damn business...

566
00:22:50,758 --> 00:22:53,389
Child, the entire time
Elliott has been here with us,

567
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,251
all that has been
running through my head

568
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:57,596
is "spy, spy, spy."

569
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,563
Don't trust the bitch.

570
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,010
That's strike one.

571
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:02,596
Bitch, ain't no strike three.
Strike two, you out.

572
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,379
- You only get two strikes.
- Mm-hmm.

573
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,562
Hey, fashion icons.

574
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:09,528
- Oh!
- Ooh!

575
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:11,000
Are you decent?

576
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:13,965
I'll take that as a "no." Yeah.

577
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:19,389
Racers, are you ready
to rock my world?

578
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,424
- Yes.
- Yes.

579
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,941
For your first maxi-challenge,

580
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:26,493
you need to perform
a new show-stopping version

581
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,217
of my song Condragulations.

582
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,527
Oh!

583
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,734
Aah!

584
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,182
Which is featured

585
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:35,976
as part
of the Werq the World tour.

586
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,355
For tickets and information,
go to VossEvents.com.

587
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:44,803
Now, each of you
needs to try and outdo me

588
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,596
with your own original verse.

589
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,010
Try it. I dare you.

590
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,700
- Ooh!
- Aah!

591
00:23:50,724 --> 00:23:52,907
Then, as a group,

592
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:57,217
you need to come up with
your own winning choreography.

593
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:58,665
Oh, shit.

594
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,734
- [laughs]
- Any dancers in the house?

595
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:05,286
Now remember, the lyrics,
the performance, and the look

596
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,631
all need to show the world
that you are number one.

597
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:11,941
Racers, start your engines,

598
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:15,320
and may the best drag queen win!

599
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,734
[laughter and applause]

600
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:20,148
Let's put the pen to the paper.

601
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,320
Rap...

602
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:23,655
lyrics.

603
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,631
Has anyone
written lyrics before?

604
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,872
I mean, I consider myself
a lyricist.

605
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm sure you do.

606
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:39,355
Well, you've been
in a boy band, so...

607
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,079
Yes, honey.

608
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:43,596
So the first thing we have to do
for this maxi-challenge

609
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,631
is we have to sit down and we
gotta write out these lyrics.

610
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:49,251
And then we go up to Sweden
to record the vocals.

611
00:24:49,275 --> 00:24:52,079
Because if you know
your boy band herstory,

612
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:55,527
all the boy bands go to Sweden,
and that's where they keep you

613
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:58,769
and they lock you up until
you come back with some singles.

614
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:02,355
Do you wanna sing or do you
wanna be, like, a bitch track?

615
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:03,562
Or, like, rapping?

616
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,424
- I don't know.
- Are you a bitch track?

617
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:06,631
I mean, I can...

618
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:07,665
She's a bitch track.

619
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:08,631
I'm a bitch track, but, like...

620
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:09,632
She's a bitch album.

621
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,734
I actually write music.

622
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:13,562
- Do you really?
- Word.

623
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,838
I compose music, yeah.

624
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,631
So I play the piano,
but I also write music.

625
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:18,286
Oh, she is a musician.

626
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,182
I'm so excited.

627
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:22,010
Our first maxi-challenge,

628
00:25:22,034 --> 00:25:24,907
and we're writing music,
something I'm good at!

629
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:28,803
Who's ready
to be the star student? Me!

630
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:33,010
Don't forget, like, we're gonna
be judged also on what we write.

631
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,044
And that's
gonna be eternal, bitch.

632
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:36,286
That's what I'm saying.

633
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,769
So you think
you're just gonna be cute,

634
00:25:37,793 --> 00:25:39,148
but remember, these lyrics
are gonna chase you around

635
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,424
for the rest of your life.

636
00:25:40,448 --> 00:25:41,941
And that's
so much more pressure.

637
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:44,010
Girl, we're gonna be jet-set.
It's gonna be gorg.

638
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,838
Well, I mean, we're
definitely all performers,

639
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:47,493
since we won
that first lip sync.

640
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:49,700
- Well...
- Well...

641
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,113
[laughs]

642
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,872
Oh, my.

643
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,734
Coming off of losing
my first lip sync,

644
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:58,217
it's a lot of stress
and a lot of pressure.

645
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,769
I already feel like these girls

646
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:02,562
feel like they have some type
of advantage over me.

647
00:26:02,586 --> 00:26:04,493
I'm the red-headed stepsister.

648
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:07,286
I need to do an incredible job,

649
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,103
because I cannot
be sent home again.

650
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:11,596

for the next ho to come out?"

654
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,044
You a dancer now?

655
00:26:19,068 --> 00:26:20,389
Let's just get
the choreography done,

656
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,527
because we're on limited time.

657
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:23,872

660
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,389
All right, bitch.

661
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:33,389
Back on the stage.

662
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:37,079
So now it is time to get
this choreography together.

663
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,700
We have to choreograph
this entire thing,

664
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:41,838
top to bottom,
from our own noggins.

665
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:43,527
Okay, so what do we do?

666
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:44,665
We're on. Who wants
to start this thing off?

667
00:26:44,689 --> 00:26:46,148
So you start first?

668
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,734
We should do the things
we're gonna do together first.

669
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,320
So we should do, like,
the chorus first,

670
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,320
and then focus on
individual stuff after.

671
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:53,321
- Sure.
- I agree.

672
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,631
Okay. So then let's start.

673
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,034
Who's a dancer
who is good with the choreo?

674
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:01,310
[tongue pop]

675
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:06,251
Cricket, cricket.

676
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:10,113
Girl, nobody
wants to be in charge.

677
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,182
And there you have it.

678
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:15,010
These girls don't know
that this is what I do.

679
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,458
I'm a choreograph dancer.

680
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:19,113
But I don't want to take charge

681
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,424
when I literally just walked in.

682
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,217
So I'm trying to just sit back,

683
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,424
let these hos figure it out,

684
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,355
and I'll just do what I'm told.

685
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,217
What if we all just went off

686
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,700
like ♪ Condragulations ♪

687
00:27:28,724 --> 00:27:30,355
♪ We're number one, one, one ♪

688
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:31,631
Should it be this,
or should it be like this?

689
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:32,769
That's too cheer-ish.

690
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:33,941
And then we could
do it together.

691
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:35,907
We could go together, like that.

692
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:37,251
That way, you can
bring the hand down,

693
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,113
and maybe we should
put the hand on the waist?

694
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:40,448
And one?

695
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:45,424
This is some bullshit.

00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:46,941
Options, bitch.

697
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,389
Oh, I like the options,
but I also...

698
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,803
We should definitely get,
like, a choreo down,

699
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:51,113

you can't do a one-two?

So let's take it from the top
again, from the chorus.

728
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,182
And then we gotta move on,
you guys.

729
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,872
We got so much to do.

That's what I was doing,
with the right... the same hand.

734
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:04,907
Okay, let's do that, then.

735
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:06,010
- Is that cool?
- Sure.

736
00:29:06,034 --> 00:29:07,217

if we do...

- I like opposite.

to not just take the reins.

- Tina?
- Yes?

741
00:29:16,068 --> 00:29:18,527
Bah-gock. So what
I think we should do

742
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:21,010
is how about, since
our leg's already out,

743
00:29:21,034 --> 00:29:22,803
we just turn on it,
since our leg is already out.

744
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,113
- Ooh.
- From the snap, turn.

745
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:26,907
So much fun.

you're the mole.

the choreography done,

Do you guys wanna just, like,
stay in this formation

and do our solos?

like, took over my soul,

845

which so isn't like me, too.

846

don't give a fuck.

any of the choreo at first,

to talk about it in rehearsal,

858

but I can be there for her now.

859
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,562
I'm so thankful and happy
that she was able to confide

860
00:33:48,586 --> 00:33:50,286
and find that sister in me,

861
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,596
and I really wanna make sure

862
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,389
that I'm supporting her
every step of the way.

863
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:56,217
May I ask, what are pronouns...

864
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,700
Like, out of drag,
I use he/him/his,

865
00:33:58,724 --> 00:33:59,803
and then in drag, she/her/hers.

866
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:01,596
I'm the exact same way.

867
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,596
I feel like when people
are trying to overthink it

868
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,838
and they call me "he" in drag,

869
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:07,493

you're just clocking me

870

- Yeah.
- We're all guys here,

872
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:14,113
so if you're gonna call them
she, do not try it with me.

873
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,458
I feel like a weight has
been lifted off my shoulders.

874
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:18,665
Cards are on the table.

875
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,389
My normal,
slightly narcissistic,

876
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:26,113
confident Gottmik headspace
took back over.

877
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:29,872
Now I just need
to kill this performance.

878
00:34:29,896 --> 00:34:32,389
- Miss Symone.
- Yes.

879
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:33,493
I know you were struggling
a little bit in the rehearsal.

880
00:34:33,517 --> 00:34:35,251
I am struggling.

881
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,838
I am very nervous
about the group stuff,

882
00:34:37,862 --> 00:34:39,251
and making sure
that, like, I'm on point

883
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:41,079
and I don't mess up
and make it, like...

884
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:44,838
I think that if you for
some reason happen to mess up,

885
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:47,113
go for it and give attitude.

886
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:49,941
Girl, it was on... I messed up,
yeah, but that was on purpose.

887
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,389
What do you know?
You don't know choreo.

888
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:52,390
The other girls are wrong,
darling, I'm right.

889
00:34:52,414 --> 00:34:53,424
Okay?

890
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:56,700
Very that about it.

891
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,803
Yeah, story time.

892
00:34:58,827 --> 00:35:00,079
Elliott, what happened
after you left?

893
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,769
The real tea, though, Elliott.

894
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:02,976
Like, what went on?

895
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,458
So you really wanna know?

896
00:35:04,482 --> 00:35:07,010
I wanna know, because we
nicknamed you Elliott the Spy.

897
00:35:07,034 --> 00:35:08,838
I feel like I'm speaking
for the group here.

898
00:35:08,862 --> 00:35:09,872
- Y'all can back me up.
- No, you right.

899
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:10,873
- Yes, honey.
- That's true.

900
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,700
I thought you came outta nowhere

901
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,665
and you already got sent home.
It was a little weird.

902
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:17,355
Reveal yourself!
Reveal yourself!

903
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:18,527
Here's kinda what went down.

904
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,700
So all the losing girls

905
00:35:20,724 --> 00:35:23,596
were set in the porkchop
loading dock.

906
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,286
RuPaul says you guys have
to vote one of the losers out.

907
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,665
- [gasps]
- Wait, what?

908
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:30,976
And they voted you out?

909
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,769
We did a lipstick vote.

910
00:35:32,793 --> 00:35:34,113
It was a tie.

911
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:36,734
Then they had to break the tie
with a re-vote.

912
00:35:36,758 --> 00:35:38,631
Oh, shit.

913
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:40,113
And it was unanimous.

914
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,907
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God.

915
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,182
All right, bitch, hold on.

916
00:35:44,206 --> 00:35:46,010
Press pause.

917
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:50,389
She got eliminated
by Tina Burner. Boom.

918
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:53,493
And then you let
other eliminated girls

919
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:54,941
eliminate you again, sis?

920
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:56,700
Bitch, you got eliminated
three times

921
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:59,424
at the beginning of the season
on the first episode?

922
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,182
Oh.

923
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,079
So they think
that you went home.

924
00:36:03,103 --> 00:36:05,872
Oh, now you're back
in the house.

925
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,562
So you might wanna make
some room in the werkroom

926
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:09,596
for some more girls.

927
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,424
Oh, my God.

928
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:12,941
That is gagging.

929
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,217
The girl that I beat
is coming back,

930
00:36:14,241 --> 00:36:17,389
along with the other girls
that were beat?

931
00:36:17,413 --> 00:36:19,286
I am definitely, like,
they are about to come back

932
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,320
with all the fires of hell
behind them.

933
00:36:22,344 --> 00:36:23,631
Now that the tea is spilled,

934
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:25,113
we can kinda be nice to Elliott.

935
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,355
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

936
00:36:26,379 --> 00:36:27,976
Well, I'm happy
to be here with you guys.

937
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,148
I love you guys so much.

938
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,389
- Oh!
- Oh, we love you, too.

939
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,769
We're Season 13 sisters now,
you guys.

940
00:36:32,793 --> 00:36:35,113
Like, you can't take
that shit away, honey.

941
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,493
But, like, did we all forget

942
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,803
that we're also walking
into elimination tonight?

943
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:40,389
[gasps, laughs]

944
00:36:40,413 --> 00:36:41,941

- Ooh, the mood has changed.

945
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,355
Oh, yeah, the mood
has changed, honey.

946
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,527
- The mood has changed, honey.
- Kandy?

947
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,976
Yes, baby?

948
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,665
If you had to send
somebody home in this room...

949
00:36:47,689 --> 00:36:49,079
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, bitch.

950
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:51,217
Like, if I had to, like,
choose a lipstick,

951
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:53,458
I'm gonna send home
the biggest competition.

952
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:54,838
Because I wanna win.

953
00:36:54,862 --> 00:36:57,320
So I would send home
Tina Burner. Goodbye.

955
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,389
I'll remember that.

956
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,734
Honestly, I'm afraid of Mik
and her fierce fashion.

957
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:05,286
Tina, who would you send home?

958
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,596
I mean, I have to send home Mik.

959
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,113
Thank you.

960
00:37:08,137 --> 00:37:09,286
You just... you're a threat,
so I gotta send Mik home.

961
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,700
- Symone.
- Yeah, I would definitely...

962
00:37:10,724 --> 00:37:12,803
It would be Tina.
You are a threat for sure.

963
00:37:12,827 --> 00:37:13,941
LaLa?

964
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,631
I would say Mik.

965
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,010
Olivia, who would you send home?

966
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:19,355
Oh, yeah, Olivia,
who would you send home?

967
00:37:19,379 --> 00:37:21,079
Well, I've realized
that a lot of you

968
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:25,148
don't think of me as the biggest
threat or a threat at all.

969
00:37:25,172 --> 00:37:26,907
- She's nothing to me.
- Oh, it's not personal.

970
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:28,838
- Drag.
- Drag.

971
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,320
Good to know.

972
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:33,631
I think I am a big threat,
but the other girls don't.

973
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:36,251
I'm not as well-known
as some of the other girls,

974
00:37:36,275 --> 00:37:37,769
but I'm not letting it
get in the way.

975
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:40,044
I have to show them
that I'm here for a reason.

00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,217
there was a hole in the back.

1215
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:30,562
Was that meant for a tail?

1216
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:32,872
Yeah, it was supposed to be,
like, a panel.

1217
00:47:32,896 --> 00:47:35,286
I don't know.
A glory hole, girl?

1218
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:37,320
Well, I mean, it could be.
[laughs]

1219
00:47:37,344 --> 00:47:40,596
Now, I want you to explain to me

1220
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,596
the thought process
behind that day look.

1221
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,665
When I was thinking, like,

1222
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:48,010
medieval, like,
mother of the hookers.

1223
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,251
But she's, like,
the head hooker.

1224
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:51,424
[all laugh]
And, like, you know, like,

1225
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:52,700
she gives it to the girls,
and she gets the girls in check.

1226
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:53,666
In my head, it made sense.

1227
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:55,044
Uh-huh.

1228
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:57,872
The thing I'm obsessed with
about you

1229
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,458
is that, like, I never know

1230
00:47:59,482 --> 00:48:01,251
what you're gonna do next
or say next.

1231
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:02,631
Have you ever watched a TV show

1232
00:48:02,655 --> 00:48:04,079
and not known
what the hell was going on,

1233
00:48:04,103 --> 00:48:05,838
but you stay tuned
for episode two?

1234
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:07,458
95% of the time.

1235
00:48:07,482 --> 00:48:09,320
I don't even know
what you said, but, yes.

1236
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,148
[all laugh]

1237
00:48:11,172 --> 00:48:13,769
That is something
that money can't buy,

1238
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,562
and it's your best attribute.

1239
00:48:15,586 --> 00:48:17,182
Tonight in your performance,

1240
00:48:17,206 --> 00:48:21,631
when you messed up your choreo,
don't let it show in your cara.

1241
00:48:21,655 --> 00:48:23,458
Because the minute
that happened,

1242
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:26,320
we saw you going,
like, full-on panic.

1243
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,251
If you're in the front,
there's no mistakes

1244
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:30,079
unless you let us know
that it's going bad,

1245
00:48:30,103 --> 00:48:31,355
you know what I mean?

1246
00:48:31,379 --> 00:48:33,044
Thank you, Kandy.

1247
00:48:33,068 --> 00:48:35,148
Do-re-mi LaLa Ri.

1248
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:36,596
I did not love your day look,

1249
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,113
just because I thought
the colors looked kind of drab.

1250
00:48:38,137 --> 00:48:39,458
I loved your night look, though.

1251
00:48:39,482 --> 00:48:41,838
I'd like to go to the club
with that girl.

1252
00:48:41,862 --> 00:48:43,665
I'd, of course, take
an Uber home about 10:45.

1253
00:48:43,689 --> 00:48:44,769
She could stay out.

1254
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:46,734
[all laugh]

1255
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:52,251
This look here, you are
a motherfucking drag queen.

1256
00:48:52,275 --> 00:48:53,389
It's 24-karat magic.

1257
00:48:53,413 --> 00:48:55,079
[all laugh]

1258
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:56,734
And then in your performance,

1259
00:48:56,758 --> 00:48:59,596
what I loved
was your confidence.

1260
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,665
When you did your solo,

1261
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,148
I was like, I wonder
where she's from.

1262
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:04,320
And then you said Atlanta,

1263
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:05,941
I was like, yep,
she's from Atlanta.

1264
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:08,010
What clubs in Atlanta
do you work at?

1265
00:49:08,034 --> 00:49:10,079
Well, I actually work
at Lips Atlanta.

1266
00:49:10,103 --> 00:49:12,562
I've worked at MSR.

1267
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,769
Of course I worked at the
Marquette, the Sleazy Queasy.

1268
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:16,493
The Marquette is still there?

1269
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:17,562
Oh, yes, girl,
it's still around,

1270
00:49:17,586 --> 00:49:19,079
up and running and strong.

1271
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:22,010
You know, I used to go there
right after the Civil War.

1272
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:23,182
[all laugh]

1273
00:49:23,206 --> 00:49:24,941
- It's true.
- Yeah.

1274
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:26,872
There was some rough girls
up in there.

1275
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,655
Ooh. [all laugh]

1276
00:49:31,724 --> 00:49:33,010
Up next, Olivia Lux.

1277
00:49:33,034 --> 00:49:35,286
Tonight, I love
this old Hollywood glamour,

1278
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,907
and I love to see a queen
of color representing it.

1279
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:39,320
And I loved all your looks.

1280
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,217
I thought your daytime look
had a lot of whimsy,

1281
00:49:41,241 --> 00:49:44,010
so I thought, okay,
she's got some humor in there.

1282
00:49:44,034 --> 00:49:46,803
You in the performance
was a joy to watch.

1283
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:49,700
The funny things that you did,
the little Mariah thing,

1284
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:53,872
you just owned that stage,
and that gets me so excited.

1285
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:55,424
And then you were smart,

1286
00:49:55,448 --> 00:49:59,044
because you wore this outfit
that had some fringe on it.

1287
00:49:59,068 --> 00:50:01,217
That always just
enhances all the moves,

1288
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:05,562
and I saw somebody that
I could not take my eye off of.

1289
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:06,803
Thank you, Olivia.

1290
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:08,113
All right, Symone.

1291
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,665
This tonight was
a different approach to lamé.

1292
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:11,872
It's very smart.

1293
00:50:11,896 --> 00:50:13,941
I love the French braid.
Yeah, it works.

1294
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:15,596
- Thank you.
- The whole thing works.

1295
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,562
In the runway,
I lived for that day look.

1296
00:50:19,586 --> 00:50:21,148
The look was hot.

1297
00:50:21,172 --> 00:50:22,907
- Thank you.
- And the night look,

1298
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:25,079
with the hair the way it was,
it was just right.

1299
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:26,389
Thank you.

1300
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:28,320
You're fierce,
you're filled with attitude,

1301
00:50:28,344 --> 00:50:31,424
but you're not afraid
to go for it and be who you are.

1302
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,665
When you came out, you know
what I wrote down here?

1303
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:35,596
- What?
- I drew a star.

1304
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,044
- [gasps]
- Yeah.

1305
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,493
In the performance,
just the way you walked

1306
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:41,044
from that corner
to the center of the stage

1307
00:50:41,068 --> 00:50:43,286
was like a spotlight
turned on you.

1308
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,655
Just right away, I was hooked.

1309
00:50:47,655 --> 00:50:48,965
You've got star quality.

1310
00:50:51,206 --> 00:50:52,562
You got it, kiddo.

1311
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:53,941
Thank you so much.

1312
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:55,562
Oh, my God, I can't...
Okay, thank you.

1313
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,803
Thank you.

1314
00:50:57,827 --> 00:50:59,389
Up next, Tina Burner.

1315
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:01,286
I thought your daytime look
was so fun.

1316
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,838
And the nighttime look

1317
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:04,734
was the perfect
naughty compliment to that.

1318
00:51:04,758 --> 00:51:06,355
Tonight, I'm really excited

1319
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:08,148
you're not wearing red,
orange, and yellow.

1320
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:10,596
You're paying homage
to Ru's favorite movie,

1321
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,389
The Wizard of Oz.

1322
00:51:12,413 --> 00:51:14,148
The ax purse,
the heart under there,

1323
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:16,320
it was all very smartly done.

1324
00:51:16,344 --> 00:51:17,562
You pay attention to detail.

1325
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:18,596
Thank you.

1326
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,251
Your lip sync was well written,

1327
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:21,700
and you performed
the hell out of it.

1328
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,458
Not only that, I was really
shocked with the rap.

1329
00:51:23,482 --> 00:51:24,700
You were in the pocket,

1330
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:27,769
and I think that
you are actually amazing.

1331
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,251
Thank you very much.

1332
00:51:29,275 --> 00:51:30,527
One thing to remember.

1333
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:33,562
This is not a bar,
this is not a theater.

1334
00:51:33,586 --> 00:51:35,562
- Yeah.
- What this is... is TV,

1335
00:51:35,586 --> 00:51:37,010
so it's gonna be
a little bit different.

1336
00:51:37,034 --> 00:51:38,355
You can't turn as much,

1337
00:51:38,379 --> 00:51:40,251
and remember,
the cameras are your friends.

1338
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,838
They're your lovers, darling.

1339
00:51:41,862 --> 00:51:44,079
I'm getting the poppers.
We're ready to go.

1340
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:45,700
[all laugh]

1341
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:48,355
That's good advice, and that's
good advice for all the girls.

1342
00:51:48,379 --> 00:51:50,424
- Poppers?
- Poppers, yes.

1343
00:51:50,448 --> 00:51:53,148
[all laugh]

1344
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:55,424
Up next, Elliott with 2 Ts.

1345
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:58,527
So your day look was very French
and very beautiful.

1346
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:01,010
Your night look is what
I was in love with, however.

1347
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,907
I thought it was fantastic.

1348
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:04,217
Thank you.

1349
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:06,010
I loved how you looked
in the performance.

1350
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:08,286
The splits, that moment
was just, like, okay.

1351
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:10,389
Oh, she's that girl.

1352
00:52:10,413 --> 00:52:11,562
When you guys were in the group,

1353
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,769
it felt like
you were just waiting.

1354
00:52:12,793 --> 00:52:14,838
Like, I'm about to show,

1355
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:16,148
like when a bull's in the pen
and he's about to come out.

1356
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:17,458
And I was like,

1357
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,010
I wonder what this one's
about to do, you know?

1358
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:22,665
I've been thinking about
what it must feel like

1359
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:24,700
to stand in your heels
this week.

1360
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,907
Because
you could have been gone.

1361
00:52:26,931 --> 00:52:28,424
- Yeah.
- And so if I were you,

1362
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:31,079
I would really have
something to prove this week,

1363
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:32,941
and I think you proved it.

1364
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:35,034
You deserve to be here.

1365
00:52:37,034 --> 00:52:38,079
Thank you, Elliott.

1366
00:52:38,103 --> 00:52:39,286
Thank you.

1367
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:40,596
Thank you, ladies.

1368
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,148
I think we've heard enough.

1369
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,838
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1370
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:47,310
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1371
00:52:48,758 --> 00:52:50,769
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

1372
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,734
what do you think?

1373
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:54,838
Starting with Gottmik.

1374
00:52:54,862 --> 00:52:57,458
Gottmik got style, got talent.

1375
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:00,562
That look was
so mind-blowing tonight.

1376
00:53:00,586 --> 00:53:03,389
As soon as the performance
started and picked up,

1377
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:04,838
she got her stuff together.

1378
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,286
And I just wish

1379
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,148
that she could just own that
from the beginning.

1380
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,217
She's new to
the performance part of drag,

1381
00:53:10,241 --> 00:53:12,286
so we've gotta see
if Gottmik is a queen

1382
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,320
that has that tool
in her tool belt as well.

1383
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:18,182
Kandy Muse, from the Bra-zonx.

1384
00:53:18,206 --> 00:53:20,941
I love that she has this body
positivity and shows it off,

1385
00:53:20,965 --> 00:53:25,838
but I think the jury's still out
on the aesthetic.

1386
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:27,769
Kandy gives me
around the way girl,

1387
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:30,355
but a little rough
around the edges.

1388
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:33,389
Okay, yes, I get it,
the aesthetic's not great.

1389
00:53:33,413 --> 00:53:35,182
And, like, I didn't understand
what she was saying

1390
00:53:35,206 --> 00:53:36,182
when she was rapping.

1391
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,183
Ha!

1392
00:53:37,207 --> 00:53:38,631
But can I keep her? Please?

1393
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:40,631
[all laugh]

1394
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:41,872
I love her!

1395
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:45,562
[laughs] From Atlanta, Georgia,
LaLa Ri.

1396
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:47,838
In the performance,
she had a control,

1397
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:50,217
and she knew what she was doing,
and I bought every second of it.

1398
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:53,872
LaLa Ri knows how to perform,
and she's ready to bring it.

1399
00:53:53,896 --> 00:53:56,527
I cannot wait
to see what LaLa Ri does.

1400
00:53:56,551 --> 00:53:57,803
She's exciting.

1401
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:59,286
Olivia Lux.

1402
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,562
Olivia reminds me
of the First Lady.

1403
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:02,596
Faith Evans?

1404
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,113
More on the Michelle Obama tip,

1405
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:07,079
but still, you get the idea.

1406
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,148
She gives me that.

1407
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:09,941
And then the performance,

1408
00:54:09,965 --> 00:54:11,527
I have to say Beyoncé.

1409
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:13,596
- Yeah.
- You know, she had the class,

1410
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,148
and she showed up
and she showed out.

1411
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:18,320
And she is so beautiful
and charming.

1412
00:54:18,344 --> 00:54:19,665
I see that smile,

1413
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,182
and it's like, oh, her.
I love her.

1414
00:54:22,206 --> 00:54:23,665
Symone.

1415
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:24,976
I know that Jamal said

1416
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,389
that Kandy Muse is like
an around the way girl,

1417
00:54:26,413 --> 00:54:27,665
- but so's Symone.
- Yeah.

1418
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:28,803
She came out
and she struck a pose,

1419
00:54:28,827 --> 00:54:29,838
and she tilted her head
to the side.

1420
00:54:29,862 --> 00:54:31,217
Like, I can't even do it

1421
00:54:31,241 --> 00:54:33,148
because my neck roll
won't let me do it.

1422
00:54:33,172 --> 00:54:35,010
But she just, like,
just stood and did that,

1423
00:54:35,034 --> 00:54:38,458
and I thought, this bitch
has got that energy,

1424
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:39,700
that confidence.

1425
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:42,148
Symone scared me
when I first saw her.

1426
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:43,182
[all laugh]

1427
00:54:43,206 --> 00:54:44,596
Just to be honest.

1428
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,734
And then with her runway look,

1429
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:48,562
that kind of just said
everything about her.

1430
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:51,527
Like, I'm gonna fight all
the way to the finish, you know?

1431
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:53,355
And that's the spirit
that I get from her.

1432
00:54:53,379 --> 00:54:54,596
Tina Burner.

1433
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,044
I was a little concerned

1434
00:54:56,068 --> 00:54:59,700
when I kept seeing
those same orange/red/yellow.

1435
00:54:59,724 --> 00:55:01,251
I'm, like, having a flashback

1436
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:03,113
to my eighth birthday party
at McDonald's, right?

1437
00:55:03,137 --> 00:55:05,355
[all laugh]
And I was thinking, okay,

1438
00:55:05,379 --> 00:55:08,113
let's rein those colors in
a little bit.

1439
00:55:08,137 --> 00:55:09,700
And she did
right at the right time.

1440
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,320
I thought that
was the smartest thing

1441
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:12,734
she could have done this week.

1442
00:55:12,758 --> 00:55:15,700
I know her from New York City,
and I have to say,

1443
00:55:15,724 --> 00:55:18,803
Tina has been living up
to the Tina Burner hype.

1444
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:22,596
I think that she's got things
that she's gonna have to...

1445
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,079
- Adjust?
- Yeah.

1446
00:55:24,103 --> 00:55:26,113
I see Tina here to play.

1447
00:55:26,137 --> 00:55:28,872
I was pleasantly surprised
in her performance,

1448
00:55:28,896 --> 00:55:31,113
and I think that
she has what it takes

1449
00:55:31,137 --> 00:55:33,113
to go all the way, actually.

1450
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:35,665
Elliott with 2 Ts.

1451
00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:37,700
She came out here
to prove something,

1452
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:38,769
and I think that's
what I picked up on.

1453
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:40,631
She was so excited,

1454
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:41,769
she kind of
got out of the element.

1455
00:55:41,793 --> 00:55:43,424
We can see that she's got it.

1456
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:44,631
We see that she can do it.

1457
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,458
And if she just
relaxes into it...

1458
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:47,872
I know
we've all heard that before.

1459
00:55:47,896 --> 00:55:49,734
[laughs] You gotta want it.

1460
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:51,355
[all laugh] You gotta want it.

1461
00:55:51,379 --> 00:55:53,458
It's gotta be tough
to be Elliott this week.

1462
00:55:53,482 --> 00:55:57,700
I think I must have ESPN,
because I was looking,

1463
00:55:57,724 --> 00:56:00,182
I was, like, there's
something going on with her.

1464
00:56:00,206 --> 00:56:01,596
And it was true.

1465
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,217
But I could tell
that the talent's there.

1466
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:05,148
I can tell that
she can serve a look.

1467
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:07,458
I love Elliott with 2 Ts'
aesthetic,

1468
00:56:07,482 --> 00:56:11,286
because it's very Exposé,
the group Exposé,

1469
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,907
for those of you who don't know.

1470
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:18,182
But it's quirky, and I love
that aspect of her presentation.

1471
00:56:18,206 --> 00:56:19,838
E-S-P-N. Got it.

1472
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:23,217

1473
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:26,665
Silence! I've made my decision.

1474
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:29,872
Bring back my girls.

1476

[RuPaul laughs]

1477
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,631
Welcome back, ladies.

1478
00:56:37,655 --> 00:56:39,217
Based on your performances

1479
00:56:39,241 --> 00:56:42,700
in the fashion show
and on the main stage,

1480
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,482
I've made some decisions.

1481
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:48,631
Olivia Lux.

1482
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,206
Symone.

1483
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:54,493
Con-drag-ulations.

1484
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:56,182
You are the top two queens
of the week.

1485
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:57,493
[laughter and applause]

1486
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:59,320
Aah!

1487
00:56:59,344 --> 00:57:03,493
Darling, I am on top of the
motherfucking world, bitch.

1488
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:05,320
I'm a real competitor in this.

1489
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:06,700
And now the girls know it.

1490
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,182
They don't see me
as a threat, right?

1491
00:57:09,206 --> 00:57:10,389
Thank you!

1492
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:11,793
Thank you!

1493
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:14,413
The rest of you...

1494
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:20,310
are safe.

1495
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:26,562
This week, there are
no bottoms, only tops.

1496
00:57:26,586 --> 00:57:30,631
Well, with the exception of
the judges' panel, of course.

1497

[all laugh]

1498
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:35,217
You may step
to the back of the stage.

1499
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,493
I thought I was lip syncing
against Kandy,

1500
00:57:36,517 --> 00:57:38,907
and I love Kandy,

1501
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:41,044
so I just feel so relieved.

1502
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:42,941
We're all staying,

1503
00:57:42,965 --> 00:57:45,085
and I cannot get to the back
of the stage fast enough.

1504
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:51,838
Olivia Lux, Symone,
great job this week,

1505
00:57:51,862 --> 00:57:56,448
but there can only be
one number one.

1506
00:57:58,206 --> 00:58:00,389
Two queens stand before me.

1507
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:05,596
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1508
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:10,448
and win a cash tip of $5,000.

1509
00:58:12,172 --> 00:58:13,872
Oh, my God.

1510
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:16,527
The time has come... [thunder]

1511
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:19,596
for you to lip sync...

1512
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,793
for the win.

1513
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:27,527
This is when you
leave it all on the stage.

1514
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:31,907
I'm going to attack it
with everything that I have,

1516
