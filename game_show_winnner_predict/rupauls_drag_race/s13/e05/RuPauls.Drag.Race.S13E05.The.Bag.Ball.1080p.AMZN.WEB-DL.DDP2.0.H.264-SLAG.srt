1
00:00:01,104 --> 00:00:02,323
RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:06,730
You'll be starring in movies
for the RuPaulmark Channel.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,939
Ooh, come on, bitch!

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,907
- [laughs]
- I am putting a wall factory

5
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:13,254
where a wall factory
ought to be!

6
00:00:13,323 --> 00:00:16,050
Why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

7
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,846
Denali.

8
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,686
I think you could have gone
way further with it.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,953
- Kahmora Hall.
- You're so buttoned up,

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,483
and I feel like
you struggle with that.

11
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,992
- Kandy Muse.
- You were a joy to watch.

12
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:30,444
But your train look,
it's a little too plain.

13
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:32,032
Symone.

14
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,068
This has never been done
on a runway.

15
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:35,794
You are the Soul Train,
I tell you.

16
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:37,796
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

17
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,212
[applause]

18
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,835
Denali, shantay you stay.

19
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,009
Thanks.

20
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:46,356
Kahmora Hall, sashay away.

21
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:57,781
- Girl.
- [sighs]

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,026
So we're back in the werkroom
after Kahmora's elimination.

23
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,027
There it is.

24
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,098
And, oh, I'm devastated

25
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,480
that I had to send
my closest friend home.

26
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,034
"Keep chasing the sparkle.

27
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:11,761
I love you ladies, Kahmora..."

28
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,971
All: Hall.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,490
Now that Kahmora's gone home,

30
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:18,975
the competition is feeling
definitely a lot more real.

31
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:21,633
It just fucking sucks,

32
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:23,635
because I know every single girl

33
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,844
is now looking at me
as a bottom bitch.

34
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:27,811
I want these girls' respect

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,021
almost as much as I want
to win this competition.

36
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,713
Girl, let me tell y'all,

37
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:34,749
being in that position
is horrible.

38
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:36,475
- The bottom three?
- The bottom three.

39
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,546
You know what's even worst?
Lip syncing!

40
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,662
I still don't think you
should have been in the bottom.

41
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:41,687
I don't either.

42
00:01:41,756 --> 00:01:43,379
Hey, I'm not a judge.

43
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,552
Wait, then, Kandy,

44
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:46,012
who do you think would
have been in the bottom?

45
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,773
I said earlier I thought Elliott
should have been in the bottom.

46
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:50,869
Watching it back, I wasn't
laughing, I wasn't kiki-ing.

47
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,536
I thought that her group
was stronger than she was,

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,459
and I thought
that Denali and LaLa

49
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:56,057
were both stronger
in their performance.

50
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,324
Really?

51
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,956
I'm here in this competition
for a reason,

52
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,844
just as well as everybody else.

53
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:04,227
I was brought back 16 times
for a reason.

54
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:07,265
So I'm sorry I wasn't
your taste of the week.

55
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,645
[all laugh]

56
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:10,682
[tongue pop] She is not a judge.

57
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,856
She doesn't get to decide
why I was safe.

58
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,169
My job is to win.

59
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:17,861
It is not to listen to peasants

60
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,290
and what they
have to say about me.

61
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,141
I was really happy
to be in the top.

62
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,349
Top two, if I say so myself.

63
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:24,834
But being that close
to "Con-drag-ulations,

64
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,663
you're the winner,"
and not winning,

65
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:28,812
it's like... I mean, I'm
so happy that my sister won,

66
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:29,839
because you know, girl,

67
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,841
the bald-headed brigade
is happening.

68
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,981
But right now, Symone
has two wins under her belt,

69
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,949
and she is my biggest
competition here right now.

70
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,813
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

71
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,539
No, no. She's competition.

72
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:41,540
No, she's competition,
but right now...

73
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:42,886
But she ain't your biggest.

74
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,025
You ain't seen us yet.

75
00:02:44,094 --> 00:02:45,486
You know what?
But from what I have seen,

76
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,830
my sister's
already won two times.

77
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,074
So for me, she's my competition.

78
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,480
I get it. I get it.
But she's not the biggest.

79
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:51,964
We all are here.

80
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:53,242
Well, we're gonna see.

81
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:55,347
I gotta bring you down
a little bit now.

82
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,625
The only thing that stopped me
from winning this week

83
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,834
was my look, so I know
that next week,

84
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:02,147
when I come back with my looks

85
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:04,632
and storm
the challenge once again...

86
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,807
- Okay.
- I can win the challenge.

87
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,015
- Okay.
- And be the winner.

88
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,672
How 'bout that?

89
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:12,571
If y'all feel that
that is shade to y'all,

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,273
saying that y'all
not big competition, baby,

91
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:15,850
then that's on y'all.

92
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,817
This is my competition
right now.

93
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,405
Okay. Remember you said that.

94
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,511
Just because you did
exceptionally well

95
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,892
in this particular challenge,

96
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,412
now all of a sudden
you sitting beside Michelle.

97
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,630
No, bitch, get back
over here in this line.

98
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:27,793
You number 12.

99
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,589
Take your original spot
right back over here

100
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:33,937
with this twisted,
busted wig on your head. Kapow.

101
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,146
We all met, and you said,
"Ooh, this cast is spicy."

102
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,941
Baby, you are the Sriracha,
bitch, okay?

103
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,667
[all laugh] Well...

104
00:03:39,736 --> 00:03:40,668
Sriracha bitch.

105
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,601
Sriracha!

106
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,992
Tamisha works off
of negative vibes,

107
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,398
and Kandy lit that fire for me.

108
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:48,538
And my thing is
ain't no bitch gonna show me

109
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,471
what you don't know about me.

110
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,957
The pageant has started,
so now we can battle.

111
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,513
Tamisha, just because you've
been doing drag for 500 years

112
00:03:57,582 --> 00:04:00,136
does not mean that
you are better than me.

113
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,966
It's a thin line between
confidence and arrogance,

114
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,140
and I can't stand that,

115
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,428
especially when
you're not on my level.

116
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:07,454
If she don't shut the fuck up...

117
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:10,871
She gonna find herself
a new enemy.

118
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,427
RuPaul: The winner

[all laugh]

128
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:41,833
So it's a new day
in the werkroom.

129
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:44,353
One girl has officially
left the competition,

130
00:04:44,422 --> 00:04:46,044
and being in the bottom three,

131
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,045
that kinda gave me
a little kick in the ass

132
00:04:47,114 --> 00:04:48,218
to get my shit together.

133
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,024
Because you could easily
be out the door, girl,

134
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:52,775
in the blink of an eye.

135
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,708
I blink two eyes, but, bitch...

136
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:57,676
[door opens]

137
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,471
Hello, hello, hello!

138
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,818
[cheering]

139
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,200
Ladykins, guess what?

140
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,995
I'm throwing a birthday party

141
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:10,206
to celebrate the inner child
that lives in each of you.

142
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,759
Hi, baby!

143
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,174
[all laugh]

144
00:05:13,243 --> 00:05:14,762
So for today's mini-challenge,

145
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:19,457
you need to shake, rattle,
and roll for Baby Got Back.

146
00:05:19,526 --> 00:05:22,425
[laughter and applause]

147
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:25,290
You've got 20 minutes
to get into quick baby drag.

148
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,671
Go!

149
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,709
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

150
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:32,159
These girls look psycho.

151
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:35,576
RuPaul, you got us doing
some crazy baby shit.

152
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:36,888
Mwah.

153
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:38,752
All right, children, remember,

154
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:43,204
the most bouncin'
and misbehavin' baby wins.

155
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:46,863
All right, let's get
this birthday party started!

156
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:47,932
Hit it!

157
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,935
Now, first up, Kandy Muse.

158
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:53,180
Yes!

159
00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:55,734
Ooh, she's a boss baby.

160
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:03,293
Now, that's a queen
who likes to pamper herself.

161
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,849
- Aah!
- Yes.

162
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:10,128
Baby wants a new daddy!

163
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:12,130
Ooh, who's a big girl now?

164
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,584
Yes!

165
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,967
I don't know why Rosé's baby
is terrifying me.

166
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,212
There's someone on your back!

167
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,559
That's what I call a baby bump.

168
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:30,217
Ooh, her diaper rash is on fire!

169
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:33,116
[all laugh]

170
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,675
Ain't nobody told LaLa
that she is three years old.

171
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:41,331
She is a full-grown woman.

172
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,712
We heard the music,

173
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,542
and she go,
oh, bitch, this is the twerk.

174
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,545
[all laugh]

175
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:50,755
Her milk bottle brings
all the toys to the yard.

176
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:53,758
[cheering]

177
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:57,244
Ooh, Shirley Temple

181
00:07:04,803 --> 00:07:07,427
Now, you were all
cutie-patooties,

182
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:10,326
but I really went gaga
for one of you.

183
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,261
LaLa Ri, you are a winner, baby.

[cheers and applause]

185
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:22,407
You've won a $2,500 gift card
from FierceQueen.com.

186
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,202
- All right!
- Whoo!

187
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,376
Now, queens, for
this week's maxi-challenge,

188
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,207
we're throwing a ball.

189
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:31,278
- Yes!
- Whoo!

190
00:07:31,347 --> 00:07:32,797
A bag ball.

191
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:38,216
That's right, you need to serve
three bag-nificent looks.

192
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,701
Now, look number one
is Mixed Bag,

193
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,393
a punny look of your choice

194
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,604
that includes the word "bag"
in its description.

195
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:48,916
Look number two, Money Bags,

196
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:53,369
a boss bitch look
that says "I own everything."

197
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,475
Opulence!

00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:57,028
[cheering]

199
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,031
And look number three,
from scratch,

200
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,309
you need to design and create

201
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:05,588
a high fashion,
show-stopping look

202
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:08,764
that's made
entirely out of bags.

203
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:09,833
Oh, my God.

204
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:13,493
As in grocery bags,
sleeping bags,

205
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:17,358
duffel bags, teabags,
and things of that nature.

206
00:08:17,427 --> 00:08:21,535
Lordy, I am feeling
a little shaken up.

207
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:23,917
I am not a seamstress,

208
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,895
and I have presented myself
so well on the runway.

209
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,231
And I don't want the look
that I personally make

210
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,130
to not be up to par.

211
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,546
All right, racers,
start your engines,

212
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:36,585
and may the best bag queen win!

213
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:39,726

215
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:41,935
Is it cute?

216
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,564
You kind of look like
Dora the Explorer.

This week's maxi-challenge
is the Bag Ball, bitch.

222
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:01,920
Oh, no! I don't even know
what I have.

223
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:05,683
They're animals. I'm basically
left with these drawstring bags.

224
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:08,548
I was not prepared for Drag Race

225
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:11,723
to turn into fucking WWE
up in this gig.

226
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,244
So what are your ideas, darling?

227
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:20,629
I originally wanted
to use the pink beanbag.

228
00:09:20,698 --> 00:09:23,355
After Miss Double T jumped in
like a flying squirrel,

229
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,461
almost knocked me over,
I found these bookbags,

230
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,370
and, like, I think
they're just really colorful

231
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,154
and, like, girly
and really playful.

232
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:30,503
Right now
I'm thinking to myself,

233
00:09:30,535 --> 00:09:33,434
all right, book bags,
really, like, bright colors.

234
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:34,401
What am I thinking,
what am I thinking?

235
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,092
Hmm, book bags.

236
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:37,749
School. First day of school.

237
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:41,097
Ho. First day
of college semester.

238
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,582
Imma be a ho!

239
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,238
I was in the top last week.

240
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:45,239
I don't wanna be
in the bottom this week.

241
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:46,320
- Right.
- No, ma'am, I wanna win.

242
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:49,105
And my look
got me through, so...

243
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,107
- Ooh!
- [laughs]

244
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,982
This ball definitely makes me
a little bit nervous,

245
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,973
because last week on the runway,

246
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,804
my ass got read down
for my fucking dress.

247
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:59,057
I don't wanna repeat that again.

248
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:00,161
I definitely
wanna win a challenge,

249
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:03,257
and if I can win
the Bag Ball challenge...

250
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:06,640
The ball? Bitch...

251
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,161
Is there anybody
you're worried about?

252
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,315
Oh, yeah, she's incredible.

253
00:10:26,384 --> 00:10:27,627
Olivia also is really good.

254
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:30,284
- Look, the stakes are high.
- Yeah.

255
00:10:30,353 --> 00:10:34,012
And there's a lot going on,
but just stick to yourself.

256
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:35,669
You're over here
sewing up a storm.

257
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:38,189
I don't see much sewing
happening over there, so...

258
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,295
We'll see who's using
hot glue and Jesus.

260
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,301
Are you experienced
with a sewing machine?

261
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,682
I am not.

262
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:51,927
If you need any assistance
with the sewing machine...

263
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:54,136
Well, I need to help
threading it...

264
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:56,172
Oh, here,
it has an automatic threader.

265
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,278
- Really?
- Yeah, so it comes down.

This slant is
where the bobbin goes.

268
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:04,077
Okay. So we take this off,
this thread off?

269
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:05,803
Nope, you...
Let's just keep that.

270
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,495
Who would have thought that
this was just this complicated,

271
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,048
to put together
a sewing machine?

00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,160
Thank you. Look at that.

- Your first bobbin!
- Oh, my God, I just bobbed!

276
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,474
- You just bobbed!
- Yes!

Come on, Miss LaLa, you bobbin.

278
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:25,995
Yes, I'm bobbin
and weavin' over here!

I still don't know
what the hell she's doing,

280
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,043
but I'm just acting
like, yeah, girl, thank you.

281
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:31,173
Just finish this for me
and let me boom, boom, boom.

282
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:33,762
Next season, girls, if you
need a seamstress, call me.

283
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,349
I'm available.

284
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,155
So I get to sewing, and boom,
bitch, I break the machine.

285
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,216
[sewing machine stops]

286
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,598
Bitch, oh, they're about
to eliminate me right now.

287
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:44,714
I done broke these people's
nice little machine, girl.

288
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,602
First round, machine.

289
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,362
Round two, let's go.

290
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:53,747
I don't know what to do,
because this doesn't bend.

291
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,473
- You know what I mean?
- Let me see.

292
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,613
I feel like
you need to cut this off

293
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,235
and then cut panels like this.

294
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:01,306
And then you could put,
like, rope in between.

295
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,654
Mm, I'm nervous.

296
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,210
I am kind of
spiraling out right now

297
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,635
because I don't have
the sewing skills

298
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:11,523
to do what I would
actually want to do.

299
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:14,906
You could do,
like, a panty with it,

300
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,461
and then, like, do, like,
a rope, like, belt fringe thing.

301
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,463
Ooh, that could be a moment.

302
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,156
Symone is stressing out
about this challenge,

303
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:24,364
which is so weird,

304
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,711
because she is one of
the most beautiful girls

305
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,989
I've ever seen in my life.

306
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:31,612
She really has
this inner situation

307
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:34,063
that really gets to her,
and that needs to go.

308
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:35,972
I just need to get her
back into that headspace

309
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,033
to remember
that she's that bitch.

310
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:41,070
I feel like we'll just
attempt to sew you into it.

311
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:42,139
That makes me nervous.

312
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,659
It does, but you're
gonna have to.

313
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:44,809
It doesn't have any stretch.

314
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,282
You can't slide into that.

315
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:49,044
I am literally...
I'm scared shitless right now.

316
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:55,084
I wanna know the tea.
Hold on. Miss LaLa?

317
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,190
- Huh?
- I heard that she was the one

318
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,502
that put you in drag
for the first time.

319
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:00,780
This is true.

320
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,333
- What?
- Yes, girl.

321
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,610
Miss Tamisha!

322
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,509
She put me in drag
many, many years ago, honey.

323
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,822
- So she's your drag mama.
- Yeah.

324
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,859
But I didn't really
take it serious

325
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,377
until, like, years later.

326
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:15,795
But she took a tour that day.

327
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:18,383
Tamisha Iman took me under her
wings, like, a few years back

328
00:13:18,452 --> 00:13:20,282
as, like, her drag child.

329
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:23,423
But we haven't really
talked in years,

330
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:26,529
so I feel like
we're both here for a reason.

331
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,808
I feel like that reason
is for us to reconnect.

332
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:31,017
It was, like, what, five years?

333
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,605
- Yeah.
- A five-year, like, break.

334
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:35,538
Imans are known for dancing.

335
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,506
You can tell that's an Iman
right away.

336
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,370
While I was getting bucked.

337
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:42,649
Any time I put a new face
or a new baby in drag,

338
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,271
they become one of my kids,
you know.

339
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,861
So LaLa was an Iman
for that day, you know.

340
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,278
But LaLa
is not an original Iman.

341
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:52,279
I don't want the kids back home

342
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,670
to say, "That bitch
ain't no Iman."

343
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:56,387
But she is always
gonna be an Iman at heart,

344
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:57,975
so I'm still
the first drag mother,

345
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,804
and it's just...
It is what it is.

346
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:04,886
I'm looking around
at these girls.

347
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:07,363
I think Symone has, like,
a bra and panty set.

348
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:08,537
Where's Waldo Girl.

349
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,711
I'm really curious
to see how LaLa does.

350
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,092
I think she had to, like...

351
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:14,439
She ran out of something.
She had to change something.

352
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:16,407
So I came up with a plan B.

353
00:14:16,476 --> 00:14:17,960
So I look at the bags,

354
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,007
I said, well, bitch,
you can hot-glue these together

355
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,388
and make, like,
a cute little dress.

356
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:24,380
So I started to hot-glue
the bags together.

357
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:25,657
As I'm hot-gluing the bags,

358
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:27,832
I realize that it's getting
less and less and less.

359
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:30,766
And I get to a point
where I realize, bitch,

360
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,873
oh, you ain't got enough
material to cover this body.

361
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:35,288
Aah.

362
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:38,325
Aah.

363
00:14:39,844 --> 00:14:41,846
I'm just gonna pray on it.

364
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,537
Lord, bitch... not bitch.

365
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:44,860
You know you're not
a bitch, Lord.

366
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,369
Lord, girl,
can you please help me out,

367
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,474
because I didn't come here
to be a bottom bitch.

368
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:52,305
So can you give me
some type of truth or knowledge

369
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,755
to surpass all of these
next challenges?

370
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:57,137
In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.

371
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,245
RuPaul: Coming up...

372
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:03,281
So you gonna bring
two little scraps.

373
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:05,974
The struggle is real.

374
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:07,089
I want to be weirder
than Carol Burnett,

375
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:08,493
scarier than Tim Burton,

376
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,736
and all in one big pblblbl.

377
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,496
Okay.

378
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,982
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

379
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,950
[RuPaul laughs]

380
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:20,309
So this week's maxi-challenge

381
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,783
is the mother fucking Bag Ball,

382
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,371
and we are all so excited.

383
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,547
So this is gonna be
real interesting.

384
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,514
Anybody got a needle?
Mine just broke.

385
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,551
Is it cute?

386
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,311
You kind of look like
Dora the Explorer.

387
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,211
[laughs]

388
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,491
So, ladies, who's been
to the ball before?

389
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,733
I'm a big fan of ballroom.

390
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:44,184
Big, big, big, big, big fan
of ballroom.

391
00:15:44,253 --> 00:15:45,875
It's an actual great place

392
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,050
to where
if you don't fit in anywhere,

393
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,673
a ball has so many
different categories

394
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,365
to where they welcome you in.

395
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:53,987
Girl, I wanna go so bad.

396
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,541
We don't have... like,
we don't have any in my city.

397
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,406
To hear Utica say, "Well,
I don't understand a ball,"

398
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:00,821
I was, like, okay.

399
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,238
This is my Jack Mizrahi
moment, you know?

400
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:05,447
Let me bring a little ballroom
to the room.

401
00:16:05,516 --> 00:16:07,863
The category is drag queen.

402
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:08,933
Bring it to the runway!

403
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:12,523
[laughter and shouting]

404
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:19,495
I have admired balls
since before I admired drag.

405
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:20,604
Catwalk, catwalk, catwalk.

406
00:16:20,634 --> 00:16:22,257
- Werk!
- Werk!

407
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,294
[cheering and laughter]

408
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,996
Because of just the pioneers
of the ballroom scene.

409
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,886
I used to hear a lot
about Willi Ninja and Leiomy.

410
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,336
She was a lot like Tandi.

411
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,682
She had no fear.

412
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:36,512
[scat singing]

413
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:37,582
Aow!

414
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:39,343
That's it?

415
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,896
- I got a bad knee.
- Oh, okay.

416
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,173
Category...

417
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:45,866
Now, that's a ball.

418
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,524
Now you can't say
you ain't seen no balls.

419
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:49,629
[all laugh]

420
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:54,254
Hey, squirrel friends!

421
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:57,085
- Hi!
- Hi!

422
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:59,259
Has anyone seen my bag?

423
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:01,675
- Which one?
- I cut it up.

424
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,163
All right, Kandy and Symone,
come on down.

425
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:07,578
Hi.

426
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,142
Kandy, you are always
in them short-shorts.

427
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,512
I just love showing off my body.

428
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:14,895
Okay. So, Kandy, sell me
on your ball presentation.

429
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:16,449
Well, first and foremost,

430
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:18,313
I'm gonna be a magician
on the main stage.

431
00:17:18,382 --> 00:17:20,763
I'm gonna be pulling some tricks
outta my bag literally.

432
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,902
Oh, really?

433
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:23,363
There will be
no undergarments showing,

434
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,733
I promise you that.

435
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,528
Only body.

436
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,357
So now, Symone,
you won last week.

437
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:29,876
I did.

438
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,405
Are these other bitches
coming for you, because...

439
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:33,017
- They're coming.
- Are they?

440
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,261
With knives and bats and things.

441
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,952
- I feel it, I feel it.
- [laughs]

442
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,621
But that's all right.
It's a competition.

443
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:39,713
What can you expect?

444
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:41,474
- That's what you're here for.
- Yeah.

445
00:17:41,543 --> 00:17:43,176
The only thing I worry about
with someone like you

446
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,651
is how deep your saboteur
might be, you know.

447
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,275
Because it's as clever
as you are,

448
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:53,520
and that's the part that it sort
of hurts my heart a little bit.

449
00:17:53,589 --> 00:17:54,877
Yeah, it's crazy
that you say that,

450
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,005
because this challenge...

451
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,397
Of course,
I don't know how to sew.

452
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,182
I was like, you know what?
You have to make it work.

453
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:02,229
You just have to push forward
and do what you know you can do,

454
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,841
and work with what you have.

455
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,533
This is something that
happens in this room a lot,

456
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:11,020
is the negotiating
the other voice in your head,

457
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
and knowing to not listen to it.

458
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,414
The struggle is real,
by the way.

459
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:16,578
The struggle is real.
What you have to focus on

460
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:17,927
is what you know
to be the truth.

461
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:19,039
And I hope
that these other girls

462
00:18:19,063 --> 00:18:20,651
are listening
to this conversation,

463
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,836
because I've been standing
at this table for 100 years,

464
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,827
and it comes up
every single time.

465
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,589
What are your musings
on that, Kandy?

466
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,832
I love it.

467
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,008
[all laugh]

468
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,667
I don't know
what the hell I just said,

469
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:40,326
but Miss Thing is over here
gagging her life.

470
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:43,467
That's fine with me.
Let her laugh.

471
00:18:43,536 --> 00:18:44,675
Thanks, ladies.

472
00:18:44,744 --> 00:18:45,745
Thanks, mother darling.

473
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:51,199
All right, Gottmik and Utica.

474
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,717
Here I come!

475
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,385
Oh, so you gonna bring
two little scraps.

476
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:56,790
[all laugh] I mean, gorg.

477
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,059
What do you think I'm wearing?

478
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,969
So tell me about
your ball extravaganza.

479
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:04,281
Do you know how to sew?

480
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,706
I did go to fashion school,
so, yeah.

481
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,087
Really? Where?
Here in Los Angeles?

482
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:09,527
Yeah, I went to FIDM,
so I have the basics,

483
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:11,460
but I haven't really practiced

484
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:12,979
in a couple years
since then, so...

485
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:15,257
Where does your style
aesthetic come from?

486
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:17,604
I'm really inspired by art,
and I'm a painter.

487
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,503
I'm inspired by shapes

488
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,884
and rearranging how, like,
the human face should look,

489
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,345
and putting things
where they shouldn't be,

490
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:25,267
and making it look
all distorted and weird.

491
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:27,925
Yeah. Is that, like,
a G-string something?

492
00:19:27,994 --> 00:19:29,064
No, it's gonna be

493
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,170
a little, like,
corsetry artistry happening.

494
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:32,585
Okay.

495
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:34,621
It's really showing my body,
which I love.

496
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,347
My waist is gonna be so smashed.

497
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,797
I'm just gonna be feeling it.

498
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,419
Well, that sounds fantastic.

499
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:42,388
And now, Utica, tell me
about your fashion aesthetic.

500
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:45,425
Weirder than Carol Burnett
and Lucille Ball,

501
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,703
scarier than Tim Burton,

502
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:50,672
and like a little bit
of Alexander McQueen,

503
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,467
and all in one big pblblbl.

504
00:19:52,536 --> 00:19:53,468
Oh, I love that.

505
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:55,263
You make outfits professionally?

506
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:58,404
I do. I make costumes
for fire dancers,

507
00:19:58,473 --> 00:20:01,130
aerialists, contortionists. Um...

508
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,925
So you use a sewing machine.

509
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,938
Oh, yeah. These are actually
the same ones I have at home.

510
00:20:04,962 --> 00:20:06,101
- You're kidding.
- Yeah.

511
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,170
Is that a sleeping bag?

512
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,446
- It's a sleeping bag.
- Uh-huh?

513
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:10,761
I'm really excited.
I think it's gonna be cool.

514
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,049
It's gonna be a bunch of these
different panels and gores,

515
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,730
and I want it to be as full

516
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,250
and as just delightful
as possible.

517
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,251
I dig it.

518
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,358
- I'm like...
- [laughs]

519
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:24,637
Well, I can't wait
to see you at the ball.

520
00:20:24,706 --> 00:20:27,640
All right, Joey Jay and LaLa Ri.

521
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,159
- Hi, there.
- Hello!

522
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,368
The bags are in the house.

523
00:20:31,437 --> 00:20:34,267
Where's your style aesthetic
come from?

524
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,235
I've always kind of
leaned towards, like,

525
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:39,168
edgy, butch queen realness,

526
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,894
sort of a little bit
lipstick lesbian.

527
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,171
- Ooh!
- Little whip crack,

528
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,450
little explosion, dance
mega-mix the house down,

529
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,003
boots back, bareback.

530
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:48,454
Sure, and those boots back
are scrunch boots, aren't they?

531
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:49,834
Uh, yes.

532
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:52,285
- [laughs]
- Yeah, a lot of times.

533
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:54,460
Are you talking
about this scrunchy boot?

534
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:57,532
This scrunchy boot
the house down?

535
00:20:57,601 --> 00:20:59,810
You want me to play
the scrunchy boot for you?

536
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:00,742
I'm gonna start you

537
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:03,158
- with an IV bag.
- Ooh!

538
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:04,849
I'm very excited
about that look.

539
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,403
It's gonna be kind of edgy.

540
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:09,129
Medical meets
futuristic villain.

541
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:10,821
Well, you had me
at medical, so...

542
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,029
Perfect.

543
00:21:12,098 --> 00:21:13,489
Where does your style
aesthetic come from?

544
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:15,481
Originally
I was inspired by Beyoncé.

545
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,482
Beyoncé.

546
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,277
And a little bit
of Grace Jones as well.

547
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:19,588
Yeah, I've heard of her.

548
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,014
And of course,
the girls around Atlanta,

549
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:22,350
the pageant girls.

550
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:23,730
You know, Atlanta's big drag.

551
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,329
Oh, when I was there,
it was the mecca of drag.

552
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:28,045
Do you think you have
this one in the bag?

553
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:29,264
I hope I have this one
in the bag.

554
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,152
Well, hoping and knowing
is two different things.

555
00:21:32,221 --> 00:21:33,844
I'm gonna give it
the LaLa Ri experience.

556
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,880
- Oh, the LaLa Ri experience.
- Yes.

557
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:38,400
The LaLa Ri experience,
bitch, is en-tergy from...

558
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:40,540
Yes, en-tergy from LaLa Ri.

559
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:42,749
You gonna get a look,
you gonna get a performance,

560
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,348
you gonna get a moment,
you gonna get a feel.

561
00:21:44,372 --> 00:21:46,305
You gonna be thinking about it
days on after.

562
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:49,204
Like, bitch, that ho
made me feel good.

563
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:52,069
All right, kids,
I will see you at the ball.

564
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:53,218
All right, thanks. See you then.

565
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,254
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

566
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:55,762
All right, gather round.

567
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,212
Gather round, queens.

568
00:21:57,281 --> 00:22:00,457
I've got one more thing
to tell you.

569
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:04,840
To add opulence
to your Miss Moneybags look,

570
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:07,326
you need to accessorize

571
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:10,398
using a fabulous
Coach Create bag.

572
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:15,437
And here's creative director
Stuart Vevers to explain.

573
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:16,818
Thank you, Ru.

574
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:19,614
For me, style
is about self-expression,

575
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:22,582
which is why I came up
with Coach Create,

576
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:25,965
a special design-it-yourself
experience.

577
00:22:26,034 --> 00:22:27,207
For this week's challenge,

578
00:22:27,276 --> 00:22:29,693
we've taken
one of my favorite designs,

579
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:31,660
the Tabby bag,

580
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,662
and sized it for a queen,

581
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:36,493
so you can step
onto the runway purse-first.

582
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:37,977
Good luck!

583
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:40,359
[all laugh]

584
00:22:40,428 --> 00:22:42,878
Thanks, Stuart.
Queens, I'll see you

585
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:45,985
and your Tabby bags at the ball.

586
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:50,196
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

587
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:52,371
[laughter and applause]

588
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,511
The RuPaul experience is out.

589
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,375
[all laugh]

590
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,617
RuPaul: Coming up...

591
00:22:57,686 --> 00:22:59,343
Joey, come here, Miss Thing.

592
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:00,803
I have the biggest crush
on Joey Jay.

593
00:23:00,827 --> 00:23:02,070
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

594
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:04,624
- But Joey's taste level...
- I feel good about it.

595
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,937
There's still a few things
that I need to, like, do.

596
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:08,594
Yeah.

597
00:23:08,663 --> 00:23:10,941
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

598
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:13,909
[RuPaul laughs]

599
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:18,258
Ball time!

600
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,470
It is elimination day,

601
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,748
and it is time to get ready
for the Bag Ball.

602
00:23:24,817 --> 00:23:26,232
I'm looking around the room,

603
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:30,063
and a lot of girls are, like,
doing very draggy silhouettes.

604
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:34,758
Mine is definitely more skimpy,
fashion-forward vibes,

605
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:37,588
as opposed to, like, drag-drag,

606
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:39,797
which makes me
a little bit nervous.

607
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:42,386
But I feel like I'm gonna win.

608
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,319
Let's go.

609
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,356
- Joey?
- Yes, ma'am?

610
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,461
Come here, Miss Thing.

611
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,645
I don't know
if y'all been catching on,

612
00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,269
but I have the biggest crush
on Joey Jay.

613
00:23:51,326 --> 00:23:54,156
Any time he's in the werkroom
I'm like, mm, hi, Joey.

614
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,745
- Is this yours?
- Yes, this is mine.

615
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:58,885
But Joey's taste level...

616
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:02,820
I feel like good about it.

617
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,695
There's still a few things
that I need to, like, do.

618
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,099
Yeah.

619
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:08,101
She seems really confident
with her look.

620
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,700
I'm looking at the costume
a little confused

621
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,084
as to what the hell
I'm looking at.

622
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:13,382
I know it's not, like,
the most exciting outfit,

623
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,145
but I think that once I can kind
of snip the last few things,

624
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:19,250
it's gonna be a clean outfit.

625
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,425
Joey, if you wanna quit drag,

626
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:23,161
we can get married,
I can win the competition,

627
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:24,670
and I can sustain both of us.

628
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:26,292
Because...

629
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:28,259
[laughs]

630
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:29,502
Oh!

631
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,507
So I have a question.

632
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:35,922
What's the tea?

633
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:39,132
So with the whole Black Lives
Matter movement going on,

634
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,686
has anyone been protesting?

635
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,032
Yeah, for sure.

636
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:44,448
When all the marches
and protests

637
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:45,797
in New York City were happening,

638
00:24:45,863 --> 00:24:48,279
I made sure I was out there
protesting.

639
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:52,007
Being an Afro-Latino
from the South Bronx,

640
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:55,666
when I see Black people
being murdered by police,

641
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:59,394
it just puts so many things
into perspective.

642
00:24:59,463 --> 00:25:01,120
Fighting for Black lives

643
00:25:01,189 --> 00:25:02,466
is very, very important to me.

644
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,030
Of course, we all know
the George Floyd thing

645
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:05,549
that really, like,
sparked all this shit.

646
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:06,919
- Yeah.
- And thank God.

647
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:08,921
I mean, like, not since that...

648
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,820
It's sad that
that had to happen,

649
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:14,064
but I'm happy that people
are waking the fuck up,

650
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:15,790
because it's always been there.

651
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:20,760
Being Black and seeing
the George Floyd video

652
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:23,591
being played over
and over and over again,

653
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,007
there's a level of trauma
that comes with that shit.

654
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:31,046
So even with corona going on,
I felt immediately compelled

655
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:33,428
to be involved in protests
here in Los Angeles.

656
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,638
Because enough is enough.
Things need to change.

657
00:25:36,707 --> 00:25:38,122
I don't know
if you guys heard about

658
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:39,431
the whole Rayshard Brooks thing

659
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:42,713
that happened in Atlanta
that got all of this press.

660
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:43,828
Well, that actually happened,

661
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,509
like, two minutes away
from my house.

662
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,062
- What?
- Oh, my God, girl.

663
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:49,306
Like, at the Wendy's
that I go to on a daily basis.

664
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,342
This situation happened,
and it kind of scared me,

665
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:52,906
because I'm, like,
that could have been me.

666
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:55,081
- That could have been you.
- Easily. You know what I mean?

667
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,485
It kind of just really hit me

668
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,764
that I could easily
be in that drive-thru,

669
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,948
and there could be a situation

670
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,526
where they pull me over
just because I look like

671
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:03,976
I don't belong
in that type of car.

672
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:07,186
It's a fear that a lot of Black
and Brown people live with.

673
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:10,120
Like, it's not a fucking game
or it's not a joke.

674
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:11,224
It's really not.

675
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:13,157
I don't know how it escalated

676
00:26:13,226 --> 00:26:16,367
from him saying that he can
just walk to somebody's house

677
00:26:16,436 --> 00:26:18,542
to him being shot.

678
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:23,029
That's crazy to me,
how it went from... ooh...

679
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:25,549
How it went from...

680
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,310
Now I'm gonna cry.

681
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:40,150
You can just be a Black person
in this world,

682
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,911
and you can just
get killed for nothing.

683
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,982
Like...

684
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:55,268
It's just... it's scary
that you could just get killed

685
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:57,167
just because of
the color of your skin.

686
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,996
Like...

687
00:26:59,065 --> 00:27:01,171
The thing about the fight

688
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,598
is Black people been fighting
to show who they are for years,

689
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,589
and it took one incident

690
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:08,765
for others to realize
that we all are still one.

691
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:10,007
Oh, yeah.

692
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,433
I think that's
the most inspiring thing

693
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:14,046
that came out of New York,
is, like, to see the support

694
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:16,669
to show up,
even during, like, COVID.

695
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,784
You may be scared
to leave your house,

696
00:27:17,808 --> 00:27:19,707
but think about,
like, people of color

697
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:21,260
and, like, transgender people

698
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:22,720
who have been scared
their whole lives

699
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:24,194
to, like,
leave their front door,

700
00:27:24,263 --> 00:27:25,713
to, like, walk down the street.

701
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:26,886
Yeah, true.

702
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:28,647
The Black Lives Matter
movement is moving,

703
00:27:28,716 --> 00:27:31,373
but the trans lives,
we losing them left and right.

704
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,066
- Yeah.
- And it's not being recognized,

705
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,585
and it's not being talked about
and covered like it should.

706
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,348
Statistically, Black trans lives
are the most at-risk.

707
00:27:40,417 --> 00:27:41,417
- Uh-huh!
- Yeah, Olivia.

708
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,661
That is true.

709
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,043
I think we're headed
in the right direction,

710
00:27:46,112 --> 00:27:47,987
but I really do think we got
a lot more work to be done.

711
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:50,599
We have to understand
that we are one,

712
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,430
and we fight as one
and we fail as one.

713
00:27:53,499 --> 00:27:55,087
Well, girls, now we know

714
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:57,641
what to do when
we leave this competition.

715
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,162
We have to use our voices
and do the right thing.

716
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:03,095
- Amen.
- Absolutely.

717
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:04,279
So use that platform wisely.

718
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:06,477
And get in some good trouble!

719
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:07,824

Welcome to the main stage

Michelle Visage.
Now, if you were a bag,

726
00:28:40,097 --> 00:28:41,858
what kind of bag would you be?

727
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:42,859
Well, we're in Hollywood,

728
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:44,792
so I'd be a plastic bag,
darling.

729
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:49,037
[laughs] Style superstar
Carson Kressley, same question.

730
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,315
Oh, Ru, I'd be a teabag.

731
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:53,007
Because you like
spilling the tea?

732
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:55,837
Uh... sure. Yeah,
we can go with that.

733

[all laugh]

734
00:28:57,597 --> 00:29:01,601
And let's welcome back
the fabulous Nicole Byer.

735
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,224
What kind of bag would you be?

736
00:29:03,293 --> 00:29:04,950
Well, Ru, I'd be a body bag,

737
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:07,573
because I got
all this body-ody-ody.

738
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:10,921
Hey! This week,
we challenged our queens

739
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,924
to serve three looks each
to the Bag Ball.

740
00:29:13,993 --> 00:29:16,651
Now, that's 36 looks.

741
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,481
Look, Ma. I can do math!

742
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,829
Just don't tell the IRS.

743
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:24,590
Racers, start your engines,

744
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,524
and may the best drag queen win!

745
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:28,697
RuPaul: Coming up...

746
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,079
Ooh, that is one long intestine!

747
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:32,736
Looks like she got rear-ended.

748
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,669
Lucky her. [all laugh]

00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,878

751
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:44,092
Let the Bag Ball begin.

752
00:29:44,161 --> 00:29:47,613
First category is Mixed Bag.

753
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:51,893
First up, Denali,
giving you Airbag.

754
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,447
Michelle: What a dummy!

755
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:55,836
Denali:
Beep-beep, mother fuckers,

756
00:29:55,897 --> 00:29:57,243
'cause I'm coming through.

757
00:29:57,312 --> 00:30:01,765
I'm a sickening Mugler,
Gaga-esque crash test dummy.

758
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:04,078
Buckle up, bitches.
[beep, beep, beep]

00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:05,769

Joey: I'm wearing
this rhinestone bodysuit,

763
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,643
and on top of that
I made this syringe armor.

764
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:21,440
I've got my IV pole,
and it's plugged into my veins.

765
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:23,891
RuPaul: Yes, she's walking
into the club nurse-first.

766
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,409
[all laugh]

767
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,826
Nicole: Oh, and that poison ivy
got her ass all swollen.

768
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,241
[laughs]

769
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:32,969

770
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:34,049
Carson: What a large sack!

771

[all laugh]

772
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:39,044
Lala: I am giving you
Voodoo realness, honey.

773
00:30:39,113 --> 00:30:42,944
So the bottom of the dress
is like a burlap sack,

774
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:45,705
and the bones are coming up
out of the bag.

775
00:30:45,774 --> 00:30:47,431
I've taken the souls
of these men

776
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,124
and put their bones
all over my body, darling.

777
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:51,711
Carson:
I think I can see her coccyx.

778
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,781

779
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,025

00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:05,415
Elliott:
I'm giving you dollar store,

784
00:31:05,484 --> 00:31:08,245
cheap gift bag,
ready to be regifted, honey,

785
00:31:08,314 --> 00:31:11,076
and once I hit
the end of the runway, bam,

786
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:13,354
my clutch is the name tag.

787
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:15,494
Girl, go ahead and unwrap me.

788
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:17,668

Tamisha: My ensemble

792
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:29,370
60 years in the game.

793
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,681
My hair done turned grey,

794
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,961
I still got on my suit
that I made 30 years ago,

795
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,376
and then I'm trying to smile,

796
00:31:35,445 --> 00:31:36,974
but I just remembered
I didn't put my teeth in.

797
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:39,173
RuPaul: She is living!

798
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:41,313
Assisted living.

799
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:43,902

802
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:51,185
Symone: I'm wearing
this velvet dress

803
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:54,153
covered in sequins, coming
down to the ground, honey.

804
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:55,499
Feathered at the bottom,

805
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:57,881
with the biggest titties
you ever did see.

806
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,608
Of course this is
a Diana Ross reference,

807
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,817
but with a little bit
of a twist to it.

808
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,750
RuPaul: It's RuPaul's
Breast Friend Race.

Olivia: I'm serving ginger,

815

Laila Ali-inspired
boxer couture.

816
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,426
I'm hyping myself up, okay?

817
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:27,946
We are about to fight.
Ding-ding-ding!

818
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:30,810

sting like a bee.

[all laugh]

824
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:44,100
Gottmik: I'm giving you
autopsy of Jane Ho,

825
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:45,860
and I'm showing you all

826
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,966
that I'm just as glamorous
on the inside

827
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,726
as I am on the outside.

828
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:52,556
RuPaul: Now, it really
took guts to pull this off.

829
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:55,283
Rosé, Bagpipes.

830
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:56,674
Michelle:
Is that a pipe in your kilt

831
00:32:56,698 --> 00:32:59,011
or are you just happy to see me?

832
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,471
Rosé: I'm giving a nod
to my Scottish upbringing,

833
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:01,738
and I'm also in plaid

834
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:03,912
as a wee, lovely,
slutty Scottish girl

835
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,123
who just got back
from her bagpipe rehearsal

836
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:10,298
and is really feeling
like her pussy's on fire

837
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:12,438
because she's actually a ginger.

838
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:14,820
Michelle: You like your queens
pipin' hot?

839
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,856
Carson: Oh, blow me.

who was going through

843
00:33:23,173 --> 00:33:24,209
my trash last night.

844
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:27,143
Tina: I am serving
girl on the go.

845
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:28,489
When I say that,

846
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:30,870
I mean I got the liquor,
and I'm ready to go.

847
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,769
I am dressed as
a mother fucking paper bag.

848
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:36,221
I am wasted with perfection.

849
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,431
Nicole: You know what they say:
recycle, reuse, and be a slut.

850
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,502
[all laugh]

851

how to handle a pole.

854
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,959
Kandy: Bitch,
I'm a sex magician.

855
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,340
Boom, bitch.

856
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:55,067
I'm pulling out a wooden stick
out of my magic bag.

857
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:57,483
Mm, it's so long, ooh!

858
00:33:57,552 --> 00:33:58,872
This garment
is very form-fitting,

859
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:01,280
tight to the body,
latex and vinyl.

860
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:03,075
Ooh, bitch, I'm hot.

861
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:05,767

the "ho" in "hocus-pocus."

867
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:17,469
Utica: I am a beautiful
French poodle,

868
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:18,884
and I am just wiggling my nose.

869
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:22,405
I am panting,
I am marking my territory.

870
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:23,992
Please curb your dog.

871
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,512
She's rocking
these poodle poufs,

872
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:27,858
but she's got a couple fleas.

873
00:34:27,927 --> 00:34:31,345
And I am just hungry
to show the judges

874
00:34:31,414 --> 00:34:34,417
who this scratchy
little bitch is.

875
00:34:34,486 --> 00:34:37,178
Carson: Rumor has it
she has a huge schnoodle.

876
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,353
[all laugh]

877
00:34:40,285 --> 00:34:41,044
RuPaul: Coming up...

878
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:43,253

882
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,777
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

883
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,711

886
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:02,100
Up first, Denali.

887
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:05,172
Carson: Fingernailed it.

888
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:08,761
Denali: I am serving you
a Cruella de Vil-inspired,

889
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,006
editor-in-chief
of a fashion company.

890
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,491
And she has got
this big custom bag,

891
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,394
and this bitch-ass long nail
that is holding her cigarette.

892
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,534
Nicole: She's smokin'!

893

Signature Joey Jay hair,

899
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,927
and, bitch,
you can't come for me

900
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:39,516
because I see you even
though I only got one eye.

901
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,000
Carson:
Oh, let me get her number.

902
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:45,798
Uh, 01000110111.

903
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,041
Oh, that must be in Sweden!

[all laugh]

908
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:56,568
Lala: I love a female that
is not afraid to be bald.

909
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,605
So I went for, like,
this Black bitch from Africa.

910
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:01,573
Like, bitch,
she makes sure you on time.

911
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:02,712
You in your area.

912
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:04,058
Bitch, she look over at you.

913
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,784
That's not right. Boom.

Elliott: I have chosen
this super-structured,

920
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:20,833
over-the-top blazer
with matching pencil skirt.

921
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:25,113
I feel like Rose Nylund
at 26 years old.

922
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,462
She is the CEO
of a lending library,

923
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:30,671
just ready to read everyone.

924
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,845
Carson: Al and I built Coach.

RuPaul: Tamisha Iman.

927
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,643
Michelle: Green means money.

928
00:36:37,712 --> 00:36:39,173
Tamisha: So I'm walking
down the runway,

929
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,819
I'm representing straight ATL,

930
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,372
the glamorous aspect of Atlanta.

931
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:45,168
We got the nice, big purse,
the hair's on fleek.

932
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,411
I have on my feathers,

933
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,526
because
we have to have a peacock.

934
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,689
That means you're rich.

935
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:51,105
She's one ol' classy,
sassy lady.

936
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,072
Carson: Oh, yes, we lepre-can.

938
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:57,387
Ladies and gentlemen,

Michelle: Oh, you are so bad!

940
00:36:59,872 --> 00:37:04,187
Symone: I am serving you
futuristic businesswoman lady.

941
00:37:04,256 --> 00:37:07,570
I decided to wear this
pink reflective material.

942
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,330
Big ol' collar.

943
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,445
VeryFifth Element, darling.

944
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:12,540
Carson: I "kneed" this look.

945
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:13,724
Michelle: Listen, those pants

946
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:14,863
would have come in handy for me

947
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:16,648
many years ago.

948
00:37:16,717 --> 00:37:18,753
RuPaul: Olivia Lux.

949
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,168
Nicole: She's cape-tivating.

950
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,032
Olivia: Can anybody
say "coffee break?"

951
00:37:22,101 --> 00:37:23,344
I'm showing the judges

952
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:26,451
that although
I'm a powerhouse executive,

953
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,694
I can still be cute
with a little cape

954
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:31,525
and show them a little ooh-ooh.

955
00:37:31,594 --> 00:37:33,423
Michelle:
Okay, guys, suit or boots?

956
00:37:33,492 --> 00:37:34,942
[all laugh]

957
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:39,291
Gottmik. Oh, my Gottmik.

958
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,226
Gottmik: I'm serving you
boss bitch boss.

959
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:47,610
I'm a Generation Z CEO, girl.

960
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,441
I have a fully Swarovski
pinstriped suit

961
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,995
with one bra side out.

962
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,342
This is what you're gonna see

963
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,414
when you walk into my meeting
at my company.

964
00:37:58,483 --> 00:37:59,874
Nicole: Ahh, that's
what I aspire to be:

965
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:02,521
Black and dripping in diamonds.

966
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,489
Yes! Wow.

967
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:05,776
Michelle: And if she thinks
I ain't gonna jump her

968
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,528
in the parking lot for
that suit, she is wrong.

969
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:13,394
RuPaul: Rosé. She means
business, big business.

970
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:15,569
Rosé: Baby,
I'm giving you eighties down.

971
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:17,881
From the triangular hair
to the red lip,

972
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,712
and we've got this beautiful
Balmain-inspired silhouette.

973
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:24,163
This look is a direct nod
to the movieBig Business,

974
00:38:24,232 --> 00:38:27,132
one of my favorite
Bette Midler roles,

975
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:30,722
and I'm feeling
completely expensive.

976
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:34,070
Michelle: Bette on it.
[all laugh]

977
00:38:34,139 --> 00:38:36,072

Carson: Sparkle, Tina, sparkle!

979
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,834
Tina: I'm long
in the tooth today, honey,

980
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:44,114
because I am serving
houndstooth Miranda Beastly.

981
00:38:44,183 --> 00:38:48,222
My houndstooth is stoned to a T,

982
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:53,434
and you best believe
I own 100% of this company.

983
00:38:53,503 --> 00:38:55,678
RuPaul: Is this
the houndstooth fairy?

984
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:59,647
Nicole: Houndstooth?
More like hounds-cute.

985
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:01,925
RuPaul: Kandy Muse. Bank rolls?

986
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:05,619
Kandy: Bam, bitch, I'm a CE-Ho.

987
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:10,037
She used to work the corners,
but now she owns the corners.

988
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:12,867
My hairpiece
and my little blunt in my hand

989
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,559
are made outta money, bitch.

990
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,354
Carson: All she sees
is dollar signs.

00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:17,838
[all laugh]

992
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:20,668
Let's get down to business.
You know, fucking.

[all laugh]

994
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,465
RuPaul: Attica? Utica?

995
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:26,881
Carson: Look at them knockers!

996
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,091
Utica: This outfit
is inspired by Carol Burnett

997
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,783
and the musicalChicago.

998
00:39:31,852 --> 00:39:35,407
So I'm giving you this
executive black, fitted suit,

999
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:37,271
all custom jewelry that I made,

1000
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,274

1002
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,554
RuPaul: Clearly, her company
has fringe benefits.

1003
00:39:44,623 --> 00:39:48,006
Yes, complete with a 401-hey.

100% bag drag.

1007
00:39:59,638 --> 00:40:00,915
Up first, Denali.

1008
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,607
Michelle:
Hey there, sugar skull.

1009
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:04,402
Denali: I am serving you

1010
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:07,750
a fashionable twist on
a traditional Mexican garment.

1011
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:12,340
I have used probably 10
of these floral print purses.

1012
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,791
I'm living
for this trellis of flowers

1013
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,518
that frames
my Dia de los Muertos face.

1014
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:20,314
I love that I get to celebrate
my Mexican heritage.

1015
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:24,939
I am so orgullosa de este...
vestido.

1016
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:27,666

D-E-Day of the Dead-dead.

Michelle: Tuile of fortune.

1020
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,432
Carson: Pinwheel of fortune.

1021
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:35,674
Joey: I'm giving you Madonna

1022
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:38,919
meets Lady Gaga
meets Minnie Mouse.

1023
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,576
I have created this look

1024
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:42,381
out of black and white
polka dot canvas bags,

1025
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:45,408
black net bags,
and some black sequin bags.

1026
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:47,686
I've got my high pony.

1027
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:51,034
I'm feeling sexy,
and I think it's adorable.

1028
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:52,184
Michelle:
Oh, whoa, you betta don't!

00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,285
Lala: Bitch, I'm serving you

1034
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:02,736
pink and purple
rock star realness.

1035
00:41:02,805 --> 00:41:04,427
I've added the purse on my head

1036
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,981
because I want them
to focus on, like, the head,

1037
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,224
and they kind of look past

1038
00:41:08,293 --> 00:41:09,881
the construction
of the actual outfit.

1039
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,711
And it gives me, like,
this whole Grace Jones vibe.

1040
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,092
Like, bitch, I am working it.

1041
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:15,956

first and foremost.

1172

You incorporated the Joey Jay
signature natural hair,

1173
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:08,351
which I wasn't mad at.

1174
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,216
But it was fun to see you
in different hairdos.

1175
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:13,529
With that said,
here on the runway

1176
00:46:13,598 --> 00:46:16,912
I can tell by looking at this
you're not the sewer.

1177
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:18,983
Maybe more of a gluer?

1178
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:21,019
- [tongue pop] You know it.
- That sound right?

1179
00:46:21,088 --> 00:46:23,815
So the construction
is not the best,

1180
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:25,541
but I've definitely seen worse.

1181
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,924
Your first look, which was,
I guess, Poison Ivy...

1182
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:30,684
- Was that the idea?
- IV bag.

1183
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:32,341
Right, but didn't you have
poison ivy,

1184
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:33,963
and the IV bag is an IV?

1185
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:36,794
- Yes, yes.
- Okay. So it was poison ivy?

1186
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:38,288
No, it was just ivy,
it wasn't poison ivy.

1187
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:39,866
- Get it? IV bag.
- No, I know.

1188
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,215
I just thought
that was the joke,

1189
00:46:41,281 --> 00:46:43,283
that it was, like, poison IV.

1190
00:46:43,352 --> 00:46:44,871
I was going for IV bag.

1191
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,219
Okay, we gotta let it go.

1192
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:50,359
Yeah, I'm gonna stop now.
I'm overthinking.

1193
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:52,568
I liked the touch of floral.

1194
00:46:52,637 --> 00:46:56,917
I wish it was poison IV
and had more of a story.

1195
00:46:56,986 --> 00:46:58,470
I thought it was poison IV bag.

1196
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:00,231
I thought it was, like,
two puns in one.

1197
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,680
You know, like a two-for-one?

1198
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:03,693
So next time someone goes,
"Ooh, was it a two-for-one?"

1199
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:04,649
Just say yes.

1200
00:47:04,718 --> 00:47:05,961
You know, just lie.

1201
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,583

you'd used the bones

1205
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:13,554
to create more of a pattern,

1206
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,246
just to give us
a little bit more

1207
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:17,904
than that haphazard
bones thrown on.

1208
00:47:17,973 --> 00:47:19,526
- Okay.
- Your Moneybags look,

1209
00:47:19,595 --> 00:47:22,425
with that great
multicolored cheetah print,

1210
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:23,668
that was really fun.

1211
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:26,326
And it allowed us
to really see that clutch.

1212
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:28,200
It's called "featuring
the merchandise," I believe.

1213
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:31,469
This look,
stunning, all of this.

1214
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:33,022
We get down to the dress.

1215
00:47:33,091 --> 00:47:36,163
Yeah, it's some bags that
were glued onto a bodysuit.

1216
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:38,683
- Yeah, that's not gonna work.
- Yeah.

1217
00:47:38,752 --> 00:47:41,065
How come you didn't cut up
them bags or do something?

1218
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:43,930
Well, originally
I was making this

1219
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:47,105
into, like, a dress
with just the bags.

1220
00:47:47,174 --> 00:47:48,531
- Mm-hmm.
- And then I ran out of bags,

1221
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,453
so I started gluing it
onto the corset.

1222
00:47:50,522 --> 00:47:53,560
But why not cut it
or do something

1223
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:56,183
so they're not just
literal bags glued to you?

1224
00:47:56,252 --> 00:47:58,772
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1225
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,739
So if something doesn't work,

1226
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:02,293
you've gotta have a plan B.

1227
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:04,640
Up next, Tamisha Iman.

1228
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:06,435
Yes, ma'am.

1229
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:08,955
Your old bag of bones
I could relate to.

1230
00:48:09,024 --> 00:48:12,165
I hope that that's me,
you know, yeah, in the future.

1231
00:48:12,234 --> 00:48:14,305
- It is.
- Hey, not now! Calm down!

1232
00:48:14,374 --> 00:48:16,100
But with that said,

1233
00:48:16,169 --> 00:48:18,309
I think you focused
more on the character

1234
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:20,483
than more about the drag
in that.

1235
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:22,416
And then your Moneybags look,

1236
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:23,807
it was just, like,
a nice business lady.

1237
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,775
I was like, oh, okay,
she gonna fire somebody today.

1238
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:27,456
It was too much like real life,

1239
00:48:27,525 --> 00:48:29,768
and I missed
the theatricalness of it.

1240
00:48:29,837 --> 00:48:33,427
This look,
it's texture for days.

1241
00:48:33,496 --> 00:48:35,671
I love that you used
oversized sequins,

1242
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:38,432
and you used
the silk jewelry bags.

1243
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:40,134
But sometimes
when you get these challenges

1244
00:48:40,158 --> 00:48:42,540
to make something
out of a bunch of stuff,

1245
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:43,679
you think more is more.

1246
00:48:43,748 --> 00:48:46,061
I think
if you got rid of the cuffs

1247
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,718
and you got rid of
or downsized that choker,

1248
00:48:48,787 --> 00:48:49,719
just want this lightened up.

1249
00:48:49,788 --> 00:48:51,756
And one thing I do wanna say

1250
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:53,654
is that your makeup
sometimes comes across

1251
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,242
a little not blended enough.

1252
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:57,451
So I'm gonna recommend to you

1253
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,119
that you talk to
some of the makeup queens

1254
00:48:59,143 --> 00:49:01,248
and get a little info.

1255
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:02,663
But you are a joy,

1256
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:05,356
and I appreciate
what you did tonight.

1257
00:49:05,425 --> 00:49:06,357
Thank you very much.

1258
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:08,635
Up next, Gottmik.

1259
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:11,155
You should change your name
to Gottaste,

1260
00:49:11,224 --> 00:49:14,158
because you have
a really good taste level

1261
00:49:14,227 --> 00:49:16,850
that transcended
all three of the looks.

1262
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:19,508
The body bag that was
that autopsy moment,

1263
00:49:19,577 --> 00:49:20,992
it was gruesome,

1264
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:23,201
but kind of fashionable
all at the same time.

1265
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,548
It was like you were
a literal dead person,

1266
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:26,929
cut open, walking at me.

1267
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,311
I was like, this is frightening,
and I'm entertained.

1268
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,591
Your Moneybags look,
like, I can't even breathe.

1269
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,869
That is a moment.

1270
00:49:35,938 --> 00:49:37,250
Thank you.

1271
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,286
It is remarkable.

1272
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:42,289
And all the details that
went with it, unbelievable.

1273
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:45,983
And then this look, it's edited,
I love the silhouette,

1274
00:49:46,052 --> 00:49:49,848
it's edgy and cool and like
a modern Joan Jett rocker thing.

1275
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:51,022
Yes!

1276
00:49:51,091 --> 00:49:53,473
Gottmik actually went
to fashion school.

1277
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:55,302
- Oh, well, there you go.
- I did.

1278
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,718
- So do you know how to sew-sew?
- I do.

1279
00:49:57,787 --> 00:49:59,272
That gets me even more excited

1280
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:00,594
to see what
you are gonna bring me,

1281
00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:03,897
because now that I know you
went to fashion school,

1282
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:06,451
she's gonna challenge you
a little bit more.

1283
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,074
Maybe I didn't go, then.

1284
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:09,730
[all laugh]

1285
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:12,112
Rosé.

1286
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:15,495
I'm gonna start with your nod
to your Scottish heritage.

1287
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:17,124
I didn't realize
you were from Scotland.

1288
00:50:17,186 --> 00:50:19,292
Yep, I was born in Greenock,

1289
00:50:19,361 --> 00:50:21,604
which is a wee town
near Glasgow.

1290
00:50:21,673 --> 00:50:23,744
That look kilt it.

1291
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,263
[laughs]

1292
00:50:25,332 --> 00:50:26,620
The silhouette was perfect,
the tailoring was perfect,

1293
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:27,955
the details were perfect.

1294
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,750
Your Moneybags moment

1295
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,305
was a nod to the great
Bette Midler.

1296
00:50:32,374 --> 00:50:34,065
Bette Midler in Big Business.

1297
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,619
And I thought it was
the simplest out of yours,

1298
00:50:36,688 --> 00:50:40,589
and it was more like a campy nod
tribute versus, like, drag.

1299
00:50:40,658 --> 00:50:42,936
And then this
I think is stunning.

1300
00:50:43,005 --> 00:50:45,525
Did you cut the bags in half,
the ones that are on the skirt?

1301
00:50:45,594 --> 00:50:48,321
Yeah, I cut them in half
and then I half-sewed

1302
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:50,116
and half-glued it
all back together.

1303
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:52,532
It had movement, as well,
so when you did those turns,

1304
00:50:52,601 --> 00:50:54,465
those bags kind of
flew out into the air

1305
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:56,294
like an amusement park ride.

1306
00:50:56,363 --> 00:50:58,779
That's a great drag look,

1307
00:50:58,848 --> 00:51:00,516
when it's fun and it has
that sense of whimsy

1308
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,335
and it makes us smile,
but it's still chic.

1309
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:04,578
- Thank you.
- Next up, Utica.

1310
00:51:04,647 --> 00:51:05,786
Hello!

1311
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,099
One thing I like
to pride myself on

1312
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:10,619
is say when I'm wr...

1313
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:11,792
Wrong.

1314
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:13,415
[all laugh]

1315
00:51:13,484 --> 00:51:14,554
Doesn't come easily.

1316
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:16,590
But I think in the beginning
I pegged you

1317
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,937
as, oh, she's
the weird, quirky queen.

1318
00:51:19,006 --> 00:51:21,285
She's gonna just do
weird shit just to do it.

1319
00:51:21,354 --> 00:51:24,736
But you have continuously
upped the fashion,

1320
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:26,428
and I think tonight
was no exception.

1321
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:30,294
Starting with your Mixed Bag,
it was just all really chic.

1322
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:33,952
And then you gave us that great
variety in your Moneybags look.

1323
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:36,852
I loved the giant,
oversized earring detail.

1324
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,992
It was just really
well executed.

1325
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:43,134
And then you came out in this,
and my mind was kind of blown.

1326
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:46,896
Sleeping bags are not
an easy medium to work with,

1327
00:51:46,965 --> 00:51:49,036
and you've made it
look flattering.

1328
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:53,800
The cowl neck with the zipper,
it's just all so enticing.

1329
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,388
Thank you.

1330
00:51:55,457 --> 00:51:56,389
Thank you, ladies.

1331
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:57,700
I think we've heard enough.

1332
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,462
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1333
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:02,636
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1334
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,469
Okay, just between
us squirrel friends,

1335
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:09,126
I think we've seen

1336
00:52:09,195 --> 00:52:12,059
one of the best looks
in Drag Raceherstory

1337
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,752
and one of the worst looks.

1338
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:15,821
[all laugh]

1339
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,686
Let's start with Joey Jay.

1340
00:52:17,755 --> 00:52:20,240
The first look, the IV bag,

1341
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:24,417
Joey didn't even realize
the poison IV was the joke.

1342
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:25,659
And then the second look,

1343
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:28,869
I thought was just, like,
okay, it's a blazer,

1344
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,319
some leggings,
we got some pumps.

1345
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:31,424
But what else?

1346
00:52:31,493 --> 00:52:34,634
It was like Chico's formal,
you know?

1347
00:52:34,703 --> 00:52:36,014
Yes, yes. And the third look,

1348
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:37,844
I thought it was fun.

1349
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,329
Did I think it was,
you know, mind-blowing?

1350
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:43,298
No, but I appreciated
that there was hair.

1351
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:45,679
[all laugh]

1352
00:52:45,748 --> 00:52:47,129
LaLa Ri.

1353
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,649
The Moneybags look
was one of my favorites.

1354
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:52,962
Her attitude and her radiance
and how she presents

1355
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:54,964
was so lovely to watch.

1356
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:57,588
Now, this look tonight, y'all,

1357
00:52:57,657 --> 00:53:01,074
absolutely no.

1358
00:53:01,143 --> 00:53:04,284
No. That face, beautiful!

1359
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:06,148
That lip, gorgeous!

1360
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:08,219
That outfit, burn it.

1361
00:53:08,288 --> 00:53:09,289
[all laugh]

1362
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:10,911
Tamisha Iman.

1363
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,361
Tamisha has that
kind of presence,

1364
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:15,675
and she's got the experience,

1365
00:53:15,744 --> 00:53:16,883
and it showed in her acting

1366
00:53:16,952 --> 00:53:18,781
when she came out
and did her "that old bag."

1367
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,473
She was really selling it,

1368
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:24,166
but it wasn't, like, a great
razzle-dazzle drag moment.

1369
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,962
Her Moneybags
was my least favorite.

1370
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:28,791
For a girl
who can sew her butt off,

1371
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:30,172
it looked kinda off-the-rack.

1372
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:34,107
Her final look, to me,
kind of says who she is.

1373
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:36,592
The way she did the bodice
and the breast part

1374
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,836
was not easily done.

1375
00:53:38,905 --> 00:53:39,802
I just think she overdid it,
that's all.

1376
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,080
- Yes.
- Gottmik.

1377
00:53:42,149 --> 00:53:45,498
She started out with her
dead-on-arrival autopsy look,

1378
00:53:45,567 --> 00:53:48,294
which I loved so much
that I was begging for more.

1379
00:53:48,363 --> 00:53:51,055
The second look, stunning.
My God.

1380
00:53:51,124 --> 00:53:54,990
I mean, you wanna talk
about texture?

1381
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:58,718
I could stare at that all night,
it was so beautiful.

1382
00:53:58,787 --> 00:53:59,902
She really got that challenge.

1383
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:02,377
We want opulence with Moneybags.

1384
00:54:02,446 --> 00:54:03,585
I don't need Mildred Pierce,

1385
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:07,174
I need today's
Alexis Carrington Colby Blake

1386
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,936
Dexter Dexter Carrington
Blake Dexter Colby.

1387
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:11,524
[all laugh] That what I need.

1388
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:13,250
And then she came out here

1389
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,806
in this deconstructed,
one-legged outfit, and I lived.

1390
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:21,396
It was so punk rock, really,
but yet so chic and fashion.

1391
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:23,708
Like, I could see this
on a runway.

1392
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:25,538
All right, Rosé.

1393
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:27,643
That first Scottish look
was so well done.

1394
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:29,542
It had a sense of humor,

1395
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:32,303
it was crafted beautifully,
it was on-brand.

1396
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,546
And then the second look,

1397
00:54:33,615 --> 00:54:35,893
I missed the tongue-in-cheek
and the fun.

1398
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:37,180
Maybe the hair was big,
I don't know.

1399
00:54:37,204 --> 00:54:38,275
Just go bigger with it.

1400
00:54:38,344 --> 00:54:40,311
Absolutely agree with that.

1401
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,245
Tonight in the final look,
I really enjoyed this.

1402
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:44,695
I thought it was fun.

1403
00:54:44,764 --> 00:54:47,180
There were different shades
of metallic in the ball skirt.

1404
00:54:47,249 --> 00:54:48,457
She knows how to edit,

1405
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:50,193
she didn't have anything
that she didn't need,

1406
00:54:50,217 --> 00:54:52,496
but she had everything
that she needed.

1407
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:53,911
Utica.

1408
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,809
She came out with
her first doggie bag look.

1409
00:54:55,878 --> 00:54:58,502
It was so chic, it was so
French, it was so fashion.

1410
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,366
That second look,
with the short,

1411
00:55:00,435 --> 00:55:03,576
Thoroughly Modern Millie
bob in brown...

1412
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,647
Thoroughly Modern
Billy-Bob Brown!

1413

[all laugh]

1414
00:55:06,855 --> 00:55:08,246
And that look with
the sleeping bags.

1415
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,237
My goodness!

1416
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,999
This girl is intuitive
about her fashion.

1417
00:55:13,068 --> 00:55:16,243
That I would see
on any runway anywhere,

1418
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,349
and people
would go crazy for it.

1419
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:21,456
My only critique is on
the first two presentations,

1420
00:55:21,525 --> 00:55:23,389
you know, she camps it up a bit,

1421
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:26,530
and I think
it kind of takes away

1422
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:29,326
from how fabulous
those outfits were.

1423
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:33,157
But, boy, you cannot take away
from the craftsmanship there.

1424
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:35,987
And I'm like, "You made this
in the same time

1425
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,955
that LaLa
glued bags to herself?"

1426
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:39,784
[all laugh]

1427
00:55:39,853 --> 00:55:41,372
That's incredible!

1428
00:55:41,441 --> 00:55:45,445
Silence! I've made my decision.

1429
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:48,310
Bring back my girls.

three iconic looks,

1436

1449
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:59,243
LaLa Ri, your final look
was epic,

1450
00:56:59,312 --> 00:57:02,419
as in epic fail.

1451

I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

to let me have it.

I'm not the loser by

is me as an entertainer
when I need to entertain.

01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:12,245
I'm a grown-ass woman.

1563
01:02:12,314 --> 01:02:14,474

something to say about me...
