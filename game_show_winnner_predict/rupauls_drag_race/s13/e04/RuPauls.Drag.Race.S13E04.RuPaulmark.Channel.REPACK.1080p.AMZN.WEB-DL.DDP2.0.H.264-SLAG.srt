1
00:00:06,275 --> 00:00:07,872
RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:10,769
You'll be performing
the song Phenomenon.

3
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:14,079
♪ Drag is all over the world ♪

4
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:17,079
♪ It's a phenomenon ♪

5
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:19,079
RuPaul: Rosé.

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,803
Your voice is beautiful.

7
00:00:20,827 --> 00:00:22,596
RuPaul: Denali.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,389
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

9
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:28,562
You're a winner, baby.
[applause]

10
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:31,113
The rest of you are safe.

11
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:35,448
But starting next week,
heads will roll.

12
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,010
Girl, the winner's circle
is here

13
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,458
waiting for the B squad
to walk in,

14
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,803
and right now, all
I can think about is, bitch,

15
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:52,286
we look motherfucking good,

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,631
and these girls are about
to gag when they walk in.

17
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,758
It's gonna be the face crack
of the century.

18
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,182
Are you girls
excited to see the girls

19
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:00,941
that you specifically sent home?

20
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:02,389
Yes.

21
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:04,734
I feel like they gonna come
in being like daggers.

22
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:06,424
Well, I mean,
they already lost one,

23
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,493
so you already know they're
coming in here with a vengeance.

24
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:09,769
- With a vengeance.
- Right, exactly.

25
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,251
You must be freaking out
a little bit.

26
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:14,734
I mean, it's more kind of,
like, a sickening feeling,

27
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:16,148
because I kinda get

28
00:01:16,172 --> 00:01:19,079
to actually confront them
for the first time.

29
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:20,700
Yeah, y'all have
some shit to talk about.

30
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:22,734
Do you guys think I should be,
like, here when they come in?

31
00:01:22,758 --> 00:01:25,113
I think you should hide, bitch.

32
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:26,424
You should hide.

33
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:27,562
I think you should gag
the girls and hide.

34
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,665
Yeah, go back there. [all laugh]

35
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,941
Oh, my God,
they're gonna fucking die.

36
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:33,424
- Y'all don't know I'm here.
- We don't know nothing.

37
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:34,425
Don't be over there laughing
either, Miss Two-Twos.

38
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:36,182
Elliott who?

39
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:38,734
Hiding Elliott is so devious.

40
00:01:38,758 --> 00:01:40,793
This is so much fun.

41
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:43,951
All right, girls,
put your faces on.

42
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:51,010
Okay, that's what's up.

43
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:53,596
Oh, look.

44
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,286
I see.

45
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,665
We walk into the werkroom

46
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:59,562
and the fucking other half
of the cast is there

47
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,286
staring at us
like fucking predators.

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,113
What's up, girls?

49
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:05,251
What up, bitches?

50
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,596
Come on, come over here,
come over here!

51
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,217
If it isn't the B squad!

52
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,182
Oh!

53
00:02:11,206 --> 00:02:12,665
Oh, so that's how it is?

54
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,527
- No, that's not how it is!
- Okay.

55
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,113
If it isn't the "anywhere
to go but down" squad.

56
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,665
[all laugh]

57
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:22,148
The other group feels like

58
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:24,527
there's this,
like, high-noseness.

59
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:28,769
There is this, like,
air of, mm, we beat you,

60
00:02:28,793 --> 00:02:31,631
and you're gonna go home again.

61
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,734
- Who won y'all's lip sync?
- I did.

62
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:35,665
Who's the winner over here?

63
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,620
- All right!
- Okay.

64
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,113
Listen, I love to stir the pot.

65
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:44,665
Wait, the real question
is, though,

66
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:47,458
so I know some of y'all
sent one girl home, okay?

67
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:48,631
I sent two girls home.

68
00:02:48,655 --> 00:02:51,665
So Miss Kahmora Hall,
if you're here,

69
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,044
what'd you do with Elliott?

70
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,286
We had to send one of us home,

71
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,148
and unfortunately,
we ended up deciding on Elliott.

72
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,424
What did you judge it on, like...

73
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:01,769
First impressions.

74
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:03,976
What was her impression
that sent her home?

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,977
Um...

76
00:03:05,001 --> 00:03:06,389
- Elliott?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:06,413 --> 00:03:09,206
Um... that.

78
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:13,355
I just didn't really get
what her drag style was.

79
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,389
I'm just like, mm, mm, mm.

80
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:18,527
Ooh, this is tasty, girl. Ha!

81
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,010
What's up, B squad?

82
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,010
[all laugh]

83
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:25,665
How we doing?

84
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:28,148
Y'all didn't expect to see me,
did you?

85
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:31,079
The Porkchop queens are gooped

86
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:33,044
when they see Elliott walk out.

87
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,389
So we have a lot to talk about.

88
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,631
Ooh! Come on, bitch!

89
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:38,320
Lay it on the table.

90
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,665
When it really comes down to it,

91
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,872
I didn't have any time
to talk about myself,

92
00:03:41,896 --> 00:03:43,734
because I was the last one
in the room.

93
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,010
Kahmora already knew
someone else,

94
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:48,251
so she already was kind of,
like, good up in the gig.

95
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,424
It was no malice behind it.

96
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:50,700
It was gonna
have to be one of us.

97
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,907
So why didn't you jump up?

98
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,665
[laughs] Oh!

99
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:55,458
Because they didn't vote me.

100
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:56,562
They voted you.

101
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:59,493
She attacked the wrong one.

102
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:02,700
All these chihuahuas beside me,
you gonna go for the pit bull?

103
00:04:02,724 --> 00:04:04,044
No, ma'am.

104
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,838
I know Tamisha Iman
from back in Atlanta,

105
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,172
and that bitch likes to fight.

106
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:13,320
It was kind of shocking
when it was unanimous for me

107
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:14,838
when y'all didn't know
nothing about me.

108
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:18,044
But, you know, now I have
a first impression of all y'all,

109
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:20,044
so it is what it is.

110
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:21,103
Okay.

111
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,458
[laughs]

112
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:25,700
Ooh, you girls are spicy, bitch.

113
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,838
[laughter]

114
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:28,665
I think the other girls

115
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:30,217
feel as though they have
the upper edge on us

116
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,907
because they won
their challenge.

117
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,872
Now we are all
the Season 13 sisters.

118
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:36,424
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

119
00:04:36,448 --> 00:04:37,965
Season 13, bitches!

120
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:42,103
There's several more rounds
to go in this race.

121
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:46,527
RuPaul: The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

Whee!

131
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,355
We're still here!

132
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:18,527
Walking into this werkroom,
I think that the competition

133
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,527
is about to get
next fucking level.

134
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:22,941
We've got both groups together.

135
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:24,527
Bitch, the room
is so full right now.

136
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:26,493
So I'm gonna
have to work really hard

137
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,941
to give 'em the that Joey Jay
experience, girl.

138
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:32,079
- This is a diverse cast.
- It's a cute cast.

139
00:05:32,103 --> 00:05:33,663
Who's single?
Who's single in the group?

140
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:36,527
Single-single! You are single.

141
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,251
You're single-single. Single?

142
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:39,355
You're single.

143
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,700
[all laugh]

144
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:43,493
Oh, my God, Joey Jay is so cute.

145
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,217
And so feminine.
I love feminine boys.

146
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,527
What made you scamper away?

147
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,251
Kandy Muse is, like,

148
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:53,872
a fun, rambunctious,
like, kid on the schoolyard.

149
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:54,976
You know, I like that bitch.

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,734
If I ain't gonna win the crown,

151
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:58,803
I'm gonna win a man.

152
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:02,320
Based on Kandy's reputation
in New York, I was worried.

153
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:05,355
And so I almost feel a little
bad, because I judged her.

154
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,803
I'm gonna say
you heard it here first.

155
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:10,586
Tina Burner and Kandy Muse
are kiki sisters.

156
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:15,872
Hello, hello, hello!

157
00:06:15,896 --> 00:06:17,493
[applause]

158
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:18,665
You better come on!

159
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:22,596
All my queens, together at last.

160
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,700
- Yes!
- Yes!

161
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,355
Now, as much as we've enjoyed

162
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,251
taking the time to get to know

163
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:31,424
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent intimately,

164
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:35,596
from this moment on,
we're putting the elimination

165
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,803
back into this competition
officially.

166
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:42,872
That's right.
Before this week is over,

167
00:06:42,896 --> 00:06:45,793
one of you will be going home
for good.

168
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:54,872
Well, now that I've put you
all in a festive spirit...

169
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:56,527
for this week's maxi-challenge

170
00:06:56,551 --> 00:07:00,355
you'll be starring
in cheesy holiday movies

171
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,113
for my new media venture,
the RuPaulmark Channel.

172
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:06,769
[all laugh]

173
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,562
But we ain't doin'
one of those Christmas movies.

174
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,700
Uh-uh. No, ma'am.

175
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,700
We are disrupting
the marketplace

176
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:16,769
with films that celebrate

177
00:07:16,793 --> 00:07:19,424
all the other holidays
of the year.

178
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:22,458
Now, to mix up
the two groups of queens,

179
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:26,596
I've taken the liberty
to assign teams.

180
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,493
Shit. Here we go.

181
00:07:29,517 --> 00:07:33,493
Then each team will assign
the individual roles.

182
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:36,769
The first team is Denali,
Elliott With 2 Ts,

183
00:07:36,793 --> 00:07:40,527
Kahmora Hall, and Olivia Lux.

184
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,769
You'll be overacting

185
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:45,724
in the Valentine's Day
tearjerker...

186
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,838
Valentine.

187
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:55,113
All right, next team
is LaLa Ri, Rosé, Symone...

188
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,251
- Ooh.
- Yes, bitch.

189
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,527
And Utica.

190
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:01,458
Now, you'll be overacting

191
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:06,758
in a soon-to-be-classic
Flag Day romantic adventure...

192
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,389
[all laugh]

193
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:12,458
And that means the third team

194
00:08:12,482 --> 00:08:15,458
is Gottmik, Joey Jay,
Kandy Muse...

195
00:08:15,482 --> 00:08:16,459
Eew.

196
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:17,655
Tamisha Iman...

197
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:21,838
And Tinta Burner.

198
00:08:21,862 --> 00:08:23,044
Tsss!

199
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,113
[all laugh]

200
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,976
You'll be acting a fool

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,044
in a rom-com that
celebrates April Fool's Day.

202
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:32,655
It's called...

203
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:40,527
Last but not least,
to help you get into character,

204
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:44,734
we've got wigs
provided by Wigs and Grace.

205
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,148
- All right.
- Yeah.

206
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,389
Racers, start your engines,

207
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:52,700
and may the best drag queen win!

208
00:08:52,724 --> 00:08:54,793
[cheers and applause]

209
00:08:55,896 --> 00:08:57,320
Movie trailer one,

210
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,631
Valentine's Day,
Misery Loves Company.

211
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:00,458
Let's just read through it,
all right?

212
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:03,527
So Misery and Ash have a fight.
That's kind of fun.

213
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:06,113
I've never done
scripted acting before,

214
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:07,424
but I'm not afraid
of a challenge.

215
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,631
So I think I'll go ahead
and take Misery Love.

216
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:12,113
- You wanna be Misery?
- I kinda do.

217
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,665
Werk.

218
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:15,458
I wanna prove that I'm more
than just a lip sync artist,

219
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:16,493
that I can act.

220
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:17,838
I absolutely feel ready

221
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:19,148
to break into
the winner's circle.

222
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:21,941
I'm gonna fight
40 times harder now

223
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:25,079
to prove that I am a threat
in this competition.

224
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:27,976
And not just a safe threat.
I'm a top threat.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,631
"Queen three,
Kewpie the Stupid Cupid.

226
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:31,803
Total airhead
with a heart of gold."

227
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:34,113
- I feel that already.
- [laughs]

228
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:37,424
Because I actually am stupid.
[laughs]

229
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:40,700
I love it!

230
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:42,010
There's just something
really annoying

231
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:43,838
about Elliott's voice
that I can't stand.

232
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,286
Oh, my God!

233
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,562
She uses the branch just like...

234
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:49,458
[laughs, snorts]

235
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,493
That kind of nasally, like...

236
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,562
Aah! [snorts]

237
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,113
I can't. [laughs]

238
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,080
[tongue pop]

239
00:09:56,104 --> 00:09:57,389
Maybe we should just

240
00:09:57,413 --> 00:09:59,148
read through the whole thing
by ourselves,

241
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:00,793
and then come together
at the end.

242
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:04,872
I realize that it's
obviously a main character,

243
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,217
but I didn't realize

244
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,803
how many lines
this character was gonna have.

245
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,665
This is a big role.

246
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,389
It's kind of overwhelming.

247
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:14,838
I definitely feel like
I have the biggest challenge

248
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,458
with this character, though.

249
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:19,148
Denali is definitely feeling it,

250
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,424
and I think she's
kind of second-guessing

251
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,172
the character she chose.

252
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,872
RuPaul: Coming up...

253
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:27,907
- Are you a Cher fan?
- I am.

254
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:29,424
Can I hear
a little bit of your Cher?

255
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:31,631
[imitating Cher] Whoa!

256
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:33,941
[laughs]

257
00:10:33,965 --> 00:10:36,172
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

258
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,251
[RuPaul laughs]

259
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:45,458
I should never have sent a fool
to do a woman's job!

260
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:46,907
I am so excited,

261
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:50,320
because we're gonna be filming
some cheesy television.

262
00:10:50,344 --> 00:10:52,389
I hope I'm not
lactose intolerant.

263
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:55,148
We got Whoopie Cushion,
we have Party Clown, Party Lady.

264
00:10:55,172 --> 00:10:57,769
"Everything she says
is delivered like a bad joke."

265
00:10:57,793 --> 00:10:59,976
I definitely want
Whoopie Cushion, hands down.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,907
The second I see
Miss Whoopie Cushion,

267
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:05,562
I don't even
let a girl get a chance.

268
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:06,700
Nope, she's mine.

269
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,493
Are you already
highlighting your lines?

270
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,217
- Mm-hmm.
- Bitch!

271
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:13,562
Bitch, this is Kandy Muse
on paper.

272
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,182
All right, so I'm definitely
happy with Whoopie.

273
00:11:15,206 --> 00:11:17,320
She's just like,
"I'm highlighting,

274
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,872
this is my role,
get into it or get lost."

275
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,320
And I'm like,
well, props to you.

276
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:21,665
That was kind of everything.

277
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,700
But also, not sure
if that's how that works.

278
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,034
But okay.

279
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,700
- God Loves Flags.
- [laughs]

280
00:11:28,724 --> 00:11:31,113
I wish every day were Flag Day!

281
00:11:31,137 --> 00:11:32,389
I didn't know Flag Day
was a real holiday.

282
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:33,665
Like, this is news to me.

283
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:36,769
Honestly, we never
been out of school

284
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,113
for Flag Day, I don't think.

285
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:39,286
As of midnight tonight,

286
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,803
I'm tearing down
the flag fixture

287
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,241
and putting a wall fixture
where the flag fix... wait.

288
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:45,665
[mumbles]

289
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:49,010
Did you just call me a bitch?

290
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,355
We're doing an acting challenge.

291
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,665
That means that the actresses
are gonna come out to play.

292
00:11:53,689 --> 00:11:55,286
Mayday! Mayday!

293
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,458
That means it's gonna be
between me and Tina.

294
00:11:57,482 --> 00:12:02,941
I should never have sent a fool
to do a woman's job!

295
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:07,148
We are both actresses,
we've got big personalities.

296
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:10,665
I can already see her taking
the lead, being hilarious.

297
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,217
So just in the back of my mind,

298
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:14,838
I'm making sure that, like,
I'm doing the same exact thing.

299
00:12:14,862 --> 00:12:18,079
Whoo-hoo!

300
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:21,355
Of course you know me.

301
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,355
[all laugh]

302
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,527
Hi-ee!

303
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:27,907
- Hi!
- Hello.

304
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:30,389
How are my lipstick
thespians doing?

305
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:33,044
- Fantastic.
- Glossed and ready!

306
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,389
Nevah bettah.

307
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,286
All right, Flag team,
come on down.

308
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,010
Hey, let's do it!

309
00:12:38,034 --> 00:12:39,182
Come on, flag.

310
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:42,182
God Loves Flags,
and that's the truth.

311
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:44,182
God do love some flags.
[all laugh]

312
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,493
That's right.

313
00:12:45,517 --> 00:12:47,941
Have you all spoken
with the other teams

314
00:12:47,965 --> 00:12:49,217
and compared scripts?

315
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,941
- Mm-mm.
- Because little secret.

316
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,527
As with all of those
type of movies,

317
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:55,872
they're all very similar.

318
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:59,458
If not exactly the same.

319
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:03,010
So what we're looking for

320
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:05,769
is for you as an actor
to take this role

321
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,734
and turn it into something
really, really special.

322
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:10,320
- LaLa Ri!
- Yes, hunty!

323
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:11,321
Are those acrylics?

324
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:12,493
No, they're press-ons.

325
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:13,562
Are you wearing
press-on nails, too?

326
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:14,700
No, these I got her done.

327
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:15,803
- Those are acrylic.
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,493
For the look and feel of what?

329
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:20,689
A woman. [all laugh]

330
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:24,217
Okay.

331
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:26,010
And then there's that.

332
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,010
That's called
method acting, you know.

333
00:13:28,034 --> 00:13:29,148
Oh, yes.

334
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:32,113
Where you embody
the character. Nice.

335
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:34,976
Now, Rosé, you have any
theater in your background?

336
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,769
I consider myself, even
through drag, an actor first.

337
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,286
- Oh, an actor first.
- An actor first, Mama.

338
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,010
So, now, Rosé and Utica,

339
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:45,562
you both voted for Elliott
With 2 Ts to go home.

340
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:49,044
What made you decide on Elliott?

341
00:13:49,068 --> 00:13:51,700
I think that
between Elliott and I

342
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,527
there was just
a very different vibe.

343
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,931
I give a very warm energy and
she gives a very cold energy.

344
00:13:57,344 --> 00:14:00,734
That's... That's interesting.
[laughs]

345
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:03,424
Utica, how do you feel
about this acting challenge?

346
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:06,010
I am playing
a token, token queen.

347
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:09,010
Oh, she tokes the marijuana.

348
00:14:09,034 --> 00:14:10,724
Have you ever
smoked weed before?

349
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:16,034
[laughs]

350
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:39,700
Oh, my God, please do that
in your... your... your...

351
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,182
Just let it all out.

352
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:44,286
What it is that you do, do that.

353
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,562
All right, ladies,

354
00:14:45,586 --> 00:14:48,389
Well, I'm gonna let you
get back to rehearsing.

355
00:14:48,413 --> 00:14:49,458
I can't wait to see what you do.

356
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,941
- All right!
- Thanks, Ru.

357
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,631
Hey, April Fools.

358
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,389
- All right.
- Come on over.

359
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,355
- Miss Kandy Muse.
- Hi.

360
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,596
How short are those shorts
you have on?

361
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,044
Um... a little panty.

362
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,596
Well, it pays to advertise.

363
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,976
- Ooh!
- Yes.

364
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,217
Any acting in your background?

365
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:08,562
I mean, I act like
I like these girls here,

366
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,148
but besides that...

367
00:15:10,172 --> 00:15:12,527
Because the thing is that
you have so much personality,

368
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:15,803
but can you turn it on
when they say "Okay, action."

369
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:17,596
All right, so now Miss Tamisha.

370
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,458
- Yes?
- What role are you playing?

371
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,113
I'm Zoltina.

372
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,700
That's the character
that's based on Cher.

373
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:25,320
Can I hear
a little bit of your Cher?

374
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:26,976
[imitating Cher] Snap out of it!

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,527
Yeah. Uh, yeah,
but better than that.

376
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:30,734
Whoa.

377
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:33,389
- Are you a Cher fan?
- I am.

378
00:15:33,413 --> 00:15:36,596
Name five Cher songs,
but don't do Believe.

379
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,827
Um... um...

380
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,734
I would say Gypsy.

381
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,562
[laughs] She's not a Cher fan.

382
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:46,734
- She ain't no Cher fan!
- I'm a Cher fan at heart.

383
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,562
- No, you ain't.
- Yes, I am.

384
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:51,872
Who are you a big fan of, where
you know everything about them?

385
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,148
It would be Gladys, Patti...

386
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,493
Natalie Cole.
I'm a big fan of Natalie Cole.

387
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:58,389
Okay. So make Natalie Cole Cher,

388
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:01,631
or your interpretation of Cher.

389
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:02,907
Gotcha.

390
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:04,113
You know, do it
however you can get there.

391
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,527
And this is for all y'all.

392
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:07,527
However you can get there,
get there.

393
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,631
So, Gottmik,
what role are you playing?

394
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,665
I'm playing April Fool.

395
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:13,941
You wound up with so many lines.

396
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,838
Will you be able
to remember them?

397
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:16,941
I have a pretty good memory,
so I think I got it.

398
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:18,148
You have a good memory.

399
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,907
So who were the three artists

400
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,217
Tamisha would have rather done.

401
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,320
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, Patti Labelle.

402
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:27,872
Uh-huh.

403
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:31,044
And then I got so distracted
by your gorgeous pussy bow, I...

404
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:33,562
[all laugh]

405
00:16:33,586 --> 00:16:35,976
- There goes the memory.
- It's all in here.

406
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,769
I cannot wait to see what
you all do with these roles.

407
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:42,286
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

408
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,355
[all laugh]

409
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,320
Hey, ladies, listen up.

410
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:51,389
Tomorrow on the runway,
category is Trains For Days.

411
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:53,010
[cheering]

412
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:56,320
Now remember, whatever you do,
don't fuck it up.

413
00:16:56,344 --> 00:16:57,355
[all laugh]

414
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,458
All right, bye.

415
00:16:58,482 --> 00:16:59,872
RuPaul: Coming up...

416
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,286
Whoo! Ah-whoo!

417
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,355
- [laughs]
- I'm not joking, bitch.

418
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,758
- Aah!
- Oh ho ho ho ho.

419
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:09,251
Who cast this ho?

420
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,241
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

421
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,275
[RuPaul laughs]

422
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:21,217
It's time to shoot
our drag holiday movie

423
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,907
with the Ross Mathews.

424
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:25,355
I am feeling boss-ass bitch.

425
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,493
Get me a wire hanger!

426
00:17:26,517 --> 00:17:28,010
I'm gonna beat the shit
outta somebody.

427
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,389
Hope you're ready to ham it up,

428
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:31,286
because ham goes
with every holiday.

429
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,389
And no pressure, but April
Fool's is my favorite holiday.

430
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:36,700
Of course it is, yeah.

431
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,976
Places!

432
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,286
Ready and action.

433
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,700
We're just one building away

434
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:46,251
from putting up a humorous
ice cream factory

435
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:50,907
where a humorous ice cream
factory ought to be.

436
00:17:50,931 --> 00:17:52,700
And I'm not joking, bitch!

437
00:17:52,724 --> 00:17:55,079
I really love
the characterization.

438
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:56,734
Have fun with it. Sell it.

439
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,079
Mik, she's giving me, like,

440
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:00,079
Joan Cusack from
Addams Family Values,

441
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:02,941
and I'm, like,
almost peeing my pants.

442
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,320
And I'm not joking, bitch!

443
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:07,251
Even more gangster.
Give it to me bigger.

444
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:09,458
And I'm not joking, bitch!

445
00:18:09,482 --> 00:18:11,182
[laughs] Great.

446
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,389
Cut, print. Moving on.

447
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:15,907
All right,
let's give this a go. Action.

448
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:20,113
Zoltina, the fortune-telling
machine from New Orleans.

449
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,872
[imitating Cher] Whoa.

450
00:18:21,896 --> 00:18:24,113
When you wake up,

451
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,665
I'd love it even more dramatic.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

452
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,872
- Okay.
- Action!

453
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,424
Whoa!

454
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,976
- Even bigger "whoa" from you.
- Okay.

455
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,251
Whoa!

456
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:37,700
Really exaggerate
the "oh-oh-oh."

457
00:18:37,724 --> 00:18:40,976
How funny can you make whoa?

458
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,665
Whoa-ho-ho!

459
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:44,700
Do that one more time.
It was good!

460
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:47,458
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.

461
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:49,389
Even longer than you think.

462
00:18:49,413 --> 00:18:50,424
[laughs] Okay.

463
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:53,182
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

464
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,734
Can you go higher with it? Whoa!

465
00:18:55,758 --> 00:18:59,000
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

466
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,182
Yes, Tamisha is slaying it.

467
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:07,286
Ho-ho-ho. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Ho! Ho!

468
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,079
Ho! Ho! Ho!

469
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:11,631
Aah!

470
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:13,734
We're in the Fools Rush In
novelty shoppe now.

471
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:15,769
Have fun with it. Action.

472
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:19,803
If it isn't my grandmother,
Sasha Fool.

473
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:22,182
You look like
you could use a good laugh.

474
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:24,527
Ugh.

475
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:25,872
Ha, gotcha!

476
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:28,148
You looked like
you could use a good laugh.

477
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:30,286
Wait, cut.

478
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,044
I think you said the same line.

479
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:34,493
- Yeah, I did.
- Okay.

480
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:36,251
I'm not gonna lie. I'm nervous.

481
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,769
You look like you could
have used a good laugh.

482
00:19:37,793 --> 00:19:42,424
Cut. Make sure we're not seeing
your profile all the time.

483
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,862
You gotta stay out
to the cameras.

484
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:48,665
Do you know which camera
is your close-up camera?

485
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:52,113
No, I don't.

486
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:53,769
- This one?
- That's it.

487
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,044
When you're talking to April,

488
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,355
you're gonna cheat
to that camera.

489
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,527
Okay.

490
00:19:58,551 --> 00:19:59,459
Make sure we can
understand everything.

491
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:00,700
And when you shake her hand,

492
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:03,527
make sure you're in there
so I can see it.

493
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay?

494
00:20:05,034 --> 00:20:06,493
Okay.

495
00:20:06,517 --> 00:20:08,010
Joey, stop looking to the side.

496
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,148
Don't look in the camera,
look past the camera.

497
00:20:10,172 --> 00:20:11,493
Enunciate your words.

498
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:12,734
Do you remember
what the line is?

499
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:15,172
Okay, now I need you
to shake her hand.

500
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,803
This is how I feel.

501
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:19,907
Moving on.

502
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:22,700
Hey, did somebody
mention my name?

503
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:24,286
[laughs]

504
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,596
You look like
you could use a good laugh.

505
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,010
You know what I'm saying,
Oh... oh...

506
00:20:29,034 --> 00:20:31,493
Whoo-hoo-whoo!

507
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:32,734
Come on, bitch!

508
00:20:32,758 --> 00:20:33,941
[all laugh] Whoo!

509
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,148
Are they laughing?
Then I'm good.

510
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:39,182
Every single person
in this room is laughing.

511
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:41,389
Bitch, ballpark.

512
00:20:41,413 --> 00:20:42,872
Outta the park.

513
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,976
Whatever that little
reference is, that.

514
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,631
All right, ladies,
that's a wrap!

515
00:20:47,655 --> 00:20:48,655
[cheering]

516
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:52,182
- Hi-ee.
- Hello!

517
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:54,217
It's time to put it on

518
00:20:54,241 --> 00:20:57,217
for the lights,
the camera, and the action.

519
00:20:57,241 --> 00:21:00,355
First scene in the flag
factory shoppe. Action.

520
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:01,941
As of midnight tonight,

521
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:04,493
I am tearing down
the flag factory

522
00:21:04,517 --> 00:21:05,838
and putting a wall factory

523
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:07,562
where a wall factory
ought to be!

524
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:08,872
[laughs]

525
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:09,907
Good?

526
00:21:09,931 --> 00:21:12,389
Good rhythm, I gotta say!

527
00:21:12,413 --> 00:21:13,562
- All right.
- Yes!

528
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,838
Symone was really quiet
in rehearsal.

529
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:19,148
All of a sudden, she's
the loudest bitch in the room.

530
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:21,872
I gotta make sure that
I'm as fierce as she is.

531
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:25,251
Okay, let's give it a go.
And action.

532
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:28,034
Hello up there!

533
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:30,286
Do I know you?

534
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,044
Honey, I'm a nonbinary,
three-foot gnome.

535
00:21:34,068 --> 00:21:35,872
You can trust me.

536
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:39,251
It's really hard not
to break character sometimes,

537
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:41,838
because Rosé
as this gnome is sending me.

538
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:42,839
Good, ladies.

539
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:43,976
Yay.

540
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,665
Places! Action!

541
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:50,517
Mother Flag-g-g has arrived.

542
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,251
- "Have you seen my bong?"
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

543
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:58,527
I'm so sorry. [laughs]
Uh... shoot.

544
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,665
Uh...

545
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:04,217
And when I came across
that... no... no...

546
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,182
Uh, cut. So, just...

547
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:07,665
Do you need to look at a script?

548
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:10,734
Off to a great start.

549
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,113
Aah! I get really nervous,

550
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:16,665
and I forget all my lines.

551
00:22:16,689 --> 00:22:19,286
All of them,
all three of my lines.

552
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,734
[laughs]

553
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,493
And action.

554
00:22:23,517 --> 00:22:27,665
Mother Flag has arrived.

555
00:22:27,689 --> 00:22:28,803
Now, where's my bong?

556
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:30,493
Not now, Mother.

557
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:33,793
Red is trying to shut down
the fa...

558
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:36,389
Not now, Mother.

559
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:37,872
Red's trying to shut down
flag factory.

560
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:39,010
What should we do?

561
00:22:39,034 --> 00:22:40,458
Okay, cut. You're upset.

562
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:42,148
You know, like, be upset.

563
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:43,838
Some stuff's going down here.

564
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,734
- Be flustered.
- Okay.

565
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:48,113
Red is trying to shut down
the flag factory.

566
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:49,769
What should we do?

567
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:52,182
I'm a little worried for LaLa.

568
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:53,769
Her performance
is a little boring.

569
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:56,586
I wish every day were Flag Day!

570
00:22:57,758 --> 00:23:00,251
Okay. Moving on.

571
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,769
I know Ross is probably
sitting here thinking, like,

572
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,217
what the fuck
is she doing, girl?

573
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,458
Like, who cast this ho?

574
00:23:05,482 --> 00:23:08,458
- Hi, Ross.
- Hi, Ross!

575
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:11,424
Hi-ee! Are you ready to make
some holiday magic?

576
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,872
- Yes! Let's do this!
- Okay.

577
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,631
Places.

578
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:17,079
Misery, is that you?

579
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:19,872
I haven't seen you in 10 years!

580
00:23:19,896 --> 00:23:23,010
When I heard you were
going to give the deed

581
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:28,355
to the Family Rose Garden
Bud Farm-fill Town Center...

582
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:29,527
Oh.

583
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:31,217
Yeah, you wanna take it again?

584
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,665
- Yeah. [laughs]
- Yeah.

585
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:36,010
Rose Family
Valentine's Day rose farm.

586
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:37,700
Sorry, one more time.

587
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:41,113
Immediately,
I'm struggling with my lines.

588
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:43,079
This is hard boots.

589
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:44,596
And action!

590
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,217
I am going to build
fudge packer factories

591
00:23:48,241 --> 00:23:51,079
where all fudge packer
factories should be.

592
00:23:51,103 --> 00:23:53,769
Cut. Have you ever seen
Mommie Dearest?

593
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:54,941
I have.

594
00:23:54,965 --> 00:23:56,286
Yeah, there's this scene
where she goes,

595
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,251
"I've put a window
where a window ought to be."

596
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:00,769
- Ought to be. Yes.
- Okay?

597
00:24:00,793 --> 00:24:02,389
So it's very important
you get these lines right.

598
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:03,734
That I get that line, okay.

599
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,113
Because you're referencing
something iconic.

600
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:08,217
Right. I am going to build
a fudge packing factory

601
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,148
where a "fudge facking
pactory" ought to be!

602
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:15,079
Okay, cut. You said
"pack fashing facory."

603
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:17,448
No bueno. No bueno!

604
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:22,320
All right, ladies,
we're gonna meet the ash tree.

605
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:25,010
Kahmora's gonna be the tree.

606
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:26,907
It's, like, a lot of
green-screen work.

607
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,803
Even though she's in
a green screen suit,

608
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:33,907
Kahmora is in full drag body
for this with her breastplate.

609
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,148
You could have wore a boy body.

610
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,527
[laughs]

611
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:38,976
Action.

612
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,562
Misery, why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

613
00:24:42,586 --> 00:24:44,079
Okay, cut.

614
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:46,044
- Ash?
- Yes.

615
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,941
You're giving
a really wooden performance.

616
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,079
[laughs]

617
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:51,079
Gimme little ups and downs.

618
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:52,493
- Got it, okay.
- Action!

619
00:24:52,517 --> 00:24:55,665
Misery, why did you leaf me?

620
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:58,286
- I was rooting for us!
- Cut.

621
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,596
How would you say that line?

622
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,700
I was rooting for us!

623
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:03,148
How would Tyra Banks say it?

624
00:25:03,172 --> 00:25:04,941
I was rootingfor you.

625
00:25:04,965 --> 00:25:06,389
Yeah, so what were you
gonna emphasize?

626
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:07,941
I was rooting for us.

627
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,838
- No.
- I'm sorry.

628
00:25:09,862 --> 00:25:12,251
- I was rootingfor us!
- Okay.

629
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:14,241
I was rooting for us!

630
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:16,907
Let's go right back to the top,

631
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,079
and you were rootingfor us.

632
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:20,827
I was rooting for us.

633
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:23,655
I was rooting for us!

634
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:27,976
I was rooting for us!

635
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,458
[laughs]

636
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:32,562
Why do you keep saying
"I was rooting for us?"

637
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:35,044
I didn't realize I'm
emphasizing the wrong thing.

638
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:37,320
You're totally...
Like, over and over again.

639
00:25:37,344 --> 00:25:38,321
I was rooting for us.

640
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,803
I was rootingfor us.

641
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:41,251
I was rooting for us!

642
00:25:41,275 --> 00:25:43,424
No. Say it... [laughs]

643
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:45,044
I think I'm saying it right, no?

644
00:25:45,068 --> 00:25:46,734
Tyra said,
"I was rootingfor you."

645
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:49,596
So, say, I was rootingfor us.

646
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,527
I was rootingfor us.

647
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,769
Last chance,
and we gotta move on.

648
00:25:52,793 --> 00:25:54,320
- Okay.
- Nail it.

649
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,976
Misery, why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

650
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,724
I was rooting for us.

651
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:03,827
Was that better?

652
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:10,493
She says it
probably, um, 78 times,

653
00:26:10,517 --> 00:26:12,769
and she still doesn't get it?

654
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:15,182
I'm watching a train wreck
happen right in front of me.

655
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,458
That's it.
I'll see you on the runway.

656
00:26:18,482 --> 00:26:21,551
I was rooting for her.

657
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:24,976
RuPaul: Coming up...

658
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,251
Girl, you're pulling it
together, honey.

659
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:27,838
You're making it work.

660
00:26:27,862 --> 00:26:30,320
Thanks, Tim. [all laugh]

661
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,079
Tina and Mik, those are
my shady little bitches.

662
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:33,838
Shady!

663
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,172
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

664
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,206
[RuPaul laughs]

665
00:26:42,344 --> 00:26:44,700
♪ Time to paint my face ♪

666
00:26:44,724 --> 00:26:45,803
Whoo! Bitch, come on, ho!

667
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:48,665
Whoo! It is elimination day,

668
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:54,217
and it is officially time
for girls to start going home.

669
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:56,734
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's become women.

670
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:59,079
Or in Tina's case, softer.

671
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:00,424
[all laugh] Aah!

672
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:03,310
Shady!

673
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,217
Gimme the thread.

674
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:08,907
How you doing?
Are you all right?

675
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:11,148
I'm re-doing my train look

676
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:14,182
because my original one
is not going to work.

677
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:16,424
So I am using
a different one now,

678
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:19,251
and I'm trying to just
jimmy-rig it for the runway.

679
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:21,907
And Gottmik and Tina
are really helping me,

680
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,838
because, bitch, I was stressing
out and going through it.

681
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:27,838
Tina and Mik, those are
my, like, shady little bitches.

682
00:27:27,862 --> 00:27:30,044
We're just so, like,
shady to each other.

683
00:27:30,068 --> 00:27:31,011
Like, no one
understands our humor.

684
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,389
We just get each other.

685
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,079
Well, girl, you're
pulling it together, honey.

686
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,080
You're making it work.

687
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,424
- Thanks, Tim.
- Okay.

688
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:37,700
We'll see you on the runway.

689
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,941
Yeah. [laughs]

690
00:27:39,965 --> 00:27:43,217
Me and Kandy and Tina are
shade monsters all day together.

691
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:45,458
We just kiki
like no other bitch.

692
00:27:45,482 --> 00:27:46,907
I love those ladies.

693
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,010
We are ride-or-dies forever.

694
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:51,665
Thank you. No, like,
really, really, like, thank you.

695
00:27:51,689 --> 00:27:53,631
Girl, we're not gonna
let you walk out there

696
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:54,803
looking like shit.

697
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,010
- Look at that. Whoo!
- Honey.

698
00:27:56,034 --> 00:27:58,389
Oh... my goodness.

699
00:27:58,413 --> 00:27:59,596
Look at that.
Look at that. Perfection.

700
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,665
That looks so good!

701
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:04,665
Yes! Werk, bitches.

702
00:28:04,689 --> 00:28:05,803
- Okay, let's fucking...
- All right.

703
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:07,517
All right, let's go get ready.

704
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,182
Symone, what was your
first time in drag like?

705
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:12,665
My first time,

706
00:28:12,689 --> 00:28:14,182
I would go home
from school every day,

707
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:15,769
and I would do my makeup
before my parents came home.

708
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:16,941
One of my classmates was like,

709
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:19,389
"So you coming to prom
in drag, diva?"

710
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,665
And I was like,
"You know what? Yeah, I am."

711
00:28:21,689 --> 00:28:24,079
And so my first time in drag,
I went to prom.

712
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:26,769
- What?
- Girl!

713
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:29,769
Yep. I saved up all my money,
my shekels, my coins.

714
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,079
I bought me a dress
off the sales rack,

715
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:37,458
I got me a shake-and-go wig,
and I put myself up in drag.

716
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,217
And then I went
into my high school prom.

717
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,941
The vice principal was like,
"Who is this?

718
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:43,665
I've never seen
this person before."

719
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,113
And the principal was like,
"That's Reggie.

720
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,803
"You know, that's Reggie
underneath there.

721
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:48,320
Go on in, Reggie,
have a good time."

722
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:49,769
And I was, like,
"All right, bitch."

723
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:50,838
Aw, so cute!

724
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,839
In Arkansas, too?

725
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,665
Oh, honey, I had no fear.

726
00:28:53,689 --> 00:28:55,217
Drag, like, took that away.

727
00:28:55,241 --> 00:28:57,700
All the fear that Reggie had,
Symone did not.

728
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:59,941
It was an empowering moment.

729
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,113
I felt good.

730
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:04,217
It was one of the first times
I felt seen.

731
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:07,389
It was the first time
I felt strong

732
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:08,931
and not scared to be myself.

733
00:29:12,103 --> 00:29:13,665
Here's a question, y'all.

734
00:29:13,689 --> 00:29:15,320
Has anyone ever dated a woman?

735
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:16,734
No!

736
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:18,113
A woman? Dated a woman?
I've never dated a woman.

737
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:19,872
I'm gold star over here.

738
00:29:19,896 --> 00:29:21,044
I had mad girlfriends
when I was, like, young.

739
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:22,389
Me, too, though.

740
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:24,562
I have biological kids.

741
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:26,907
[gasps] Wait!
She got kids, bitch!

742
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,182
- What?
- Kids?

743
00:29:28,206 --> 00:29:29,527
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah, I know, right?

744
00:29:29,551 --> 00:29:31,113
I have three biological kids.

745
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,562
Aah! What?

746
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:34,320
My youngest is 33,

747
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:37,907
and the oldest
have just turned 35.

748
00:29:37,931 --> 00:29:39,941
- What?
- Oh, my God.

749
00:29:39,965 --> 00:29:42,734
My twins, I dated their mother
during high school.

750
00:29:42,758 --> 00:29:45,320
After her,
went with another girl,

751
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:50,493
and my life
has just been a whirlwind.

752
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:53,976
Long story short,
I didn't realize that I was gay

753
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,527
until after
I got outta high school.

754
00:29:55,551 --> 00:29:57,010
And do they know...
They know about the gay?

755
00:29:57,034 --> 00:29:58,251
- They know you're, like...
- Yeah.

756
00:29:58,275 --> 00:29:59,803
Are they gonna watch the show?

757
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:01,320
Sure.

758
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:04,700
After I parted with
the second baby mother,

759
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:06,596
I had a friend in Atlanta
that was gay.

760
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,389
So his thing was
let's just go hang out.

761
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:10,734
You know, let me
show you my world.

762
00:30:10,758 --> 00:30:12,907
I don't know if he
saw something or whatever,

763
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:14,631
but nevertheless,
we went to the club.

764
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:16,907
To see guys dancing with guys,

765
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:17,873
that was amazing.

766
00:30:17,897 --> 00:30:19,389
It was an "aha" moment.

767
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,872
Long story short, I started
doing drag when I was 20.

768
00:30:22,896 --> 00:30:25,631
So my drag name actually comes
from my oldest daughter.

769
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:27,251
Your oldest biological daughter?

770
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:29,148
Yeah. Her name is Tamisha.

771
00:30:29,172 --> 00:30:31,976
- Aw!
- Aw!

772
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,527
Is her middle name
"Coming For You?"

773
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,562
[all laugh]

774
00:30:34,586 --> 00:30:36,527

Show the girls what art can do.

776
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,113
We weren't there,
so y'all can't sing that.

777
00:30:40,137 --> 00:30:41,700
Yeah, thank you.

778
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:43,769

783

[all laugh]

880
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,976
LaLa: So, baby, I'm slithering
down this runway,

881
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,941
giving them life
in my snakeskin train.

882
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:05,908
I gave you a myth.

883
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:07,631
All you see is the eyes,

884
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:09,527
and she's still penetrating
your soul with just the eyes.

885
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:10,734
And it's hot!

886
00:35:10,758 --> 00:35:13,734
If that wasn't enough, bitch...

887
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,976
She's shedding, America.
She's shedding, darling.

888
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,182
Bitch, I'm living.

889
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:19,137
Michelle:
Give us that venom, baby.

890
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:25,079
RuPaul: Next stop, Syracuse,
Schenectady, Utica.

891
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:26,493
Michelle: Does the carpet
match the drapes?

892
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,389
[all laugh]

893
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:31,458
Utica: I am wearing
a Carol Burnett-inspired piece

894
00:35:31,482 --> 00:35:35,044
from her iconic
Gone With the Wind sketch.

895
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:38,631
I am feeling so comedic,
so silly,

896
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:41,251
and I'm just feeling great
in these drapes.

897
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:42,458
Ross: The shade!

898
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:44,286
[all laugh]

899
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,389
RuPaul: Rosé.

900
00:35:46,413 --> 00:35:48,389
Michelle: Well,
she's acting very aloof-ah.

901
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,148
[all laugh]

902
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:52,596
Rosé: Miss Rosé
loves the eighties,

903
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,493
and tonight
I am Lady Tuxedo down.

904
00:35:56,517 --> 00:36:01,424
Enormous amounts of tulle
cascading down my back.

905
00:36:01,448 --> 00:36:03,665
My Mohawk even has a train.

906
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:07,044
That's how dedicated I am to
this fucking craft, okay, baby?

907
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:08,320
Michelle: Ladies and gentlemen,

908
00:36:08,344 --> 00:36:10,148
I'm your cruise director,
Tullie McCoy.

909
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:11,941
[all laugh]

910
00:36:11,965 --> 00:36:13,355
RuPaul: Gottmik.

911
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,044
- [exhales]
- Ooh!

912
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:15,977
Ross: Hold on, I think
we're about to get blown.

913
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,527
Michelle: Ooh, yay!

914
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:22,217
Gottmik: I am giving you
trans train artistry.

915
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:25,044
Chiffon behind me,

916
00:36:25,068 --> 00:36:28,044
and I have a fully bedazzled
leaf blower to go with it.

917
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,976
I brought my own wind, girl.

918
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,148
RuPaul: She is the wind
beneath her own damn wings.

919
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:35,079
[all laugh]

920
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,734
RuPaul: Tina Burner.

921
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:39,010
Ross: You know, this was
once worn by Trainy Kazan.

922
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:40,769
[all laugh]

923
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:42,320
Tina: I am serving you

924
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:44,113
the conductor
of this train, henny,

925
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:47,148
full-on
Tina Burner camp couture.

926
00:36:47,172 --> 00:36:48,872
Let those bitches
be the caboose,

927
00:36:48,896 --> 00:36:51,355
because this motherfucker is
running the train up in here.

928
00:36:51,379 --> 00:36:54,320
RuPaul: Tina!
Bring me the track!

929
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:57,079
[all laugh]

930
00:36:57,103 --> 00:36:59,734
Joey Jay from the KGB.

931
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:02,044
Oh, she took the S&M train.

932
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:03,079
- Mm.
- Ooh!

933
00:37:03,103 --> 00:37:04,424
Joey: I wanted to go

934
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:06,907
a Joey Jay
wacky direction with this.

935
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:08,838
A pussy-eating tongue,

936
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,631
hand-painted, hand-sewn
by yours truly.

937
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:13,872
Bitch, eat it.

938
00:37:13,896 --> 00:37:16,113
Ross: Finally a look with taste.

939
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:17,872
[all laugh]

940
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:19,251
RuPaul: Kandy Muse.

941
00:37:19,275 --> 00:37:20,907
Ross: I think she's wearing
her training bra.

942
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:22,389
RuPaul: Oh.

943
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:26,941
Kandy: Blood red
velvet leather fantasy,

944
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:29,527
looking like
a vamptress herself.

945
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:33,217
And when I turn the corner,
poof, slow the train.

946
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,251
I look so sexy. Mm!

947
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:37,907
Michelle: This dress
is the train event.

948
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,803
RuPaul: Tamisha Iman.

949
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,148
Loni: This the Diana Ross train.

950
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:42,838
RuPaul: Yes.

951
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:44,769
Tamisha: This is another one
of the Tamisha Iman creations.

952
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:46,803
Yeah, I made this one as well.

953
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:48,596
The train is flowing
like it's supposed to.

954
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,596
I'm confident in it,
and I don't care where you are,

955
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,079
you're gonna notice this pink
from across the room.

956
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:56,320
RuPaul: She got some juice
in that caboose.

957
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:57,527
Michelle: Yes, she does.

958
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:59,872
Hey, Ru, is the train
still running?

959
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:00,941
[all laugh]

960
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:02,182
RuPaul: Coming up...

961
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:04,148
I loved your characterization.

962
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:05,838
I can't wait to see more of you.

963
00:38:05,862 --> 00:38:08,872
Your performance. What a dump!

964
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,206
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

965
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:15,251
[RuPaul laughs]

966
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,320
Welcome, queens.

967
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:21,734
I'm proud to present
our programming slate for 2021.

968
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:26,286
Our first film
stars Denali, Olivia Lux,

969
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,355
Elliott, and Kahmora Hall.

970
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:31,458
Announcer: This Valentine's Day,

971
00:38:31,482 --> 00:38:32,976
get ready to fall in love

972
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,010
in the RuPaulmark original...

973
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:39,458
Misery is a successful
businesswoman

974
00:38:39,482 --> 00:38:40,700
who hates Valentine's Day.

975
00:38:40,724 --> 00:38:45,803
I hate Valentine's Day,
and I hate roses!

976
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,700
So when Misery Love inherits

977
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:50,355
the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm,

978
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:52,700
things get thorny.

979
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:55,596
What a dump.

980
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,320
Misery, is that you?

981
00:38:58,344 --> 00:38:59,838
When I heard
you were gonna give me

982
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:02,907
the deed to the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm,

983
00:39:02,931 --> 00:39:06,182
well, I mean
when I heard you were dying,

984
00:39:06,206 --> 00:39:07,872
I dropped everything.

985
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:09,700
I would have dropped
a few pounds, too,

986
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:10,701
while you were at it.

987
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,355
Did I say that out loud?

988
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:17,010
I own 51% of this company.

989
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,389
Well, I would love
to give you the deed,

990
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:20,493
but the movie's just starting.

991
00:39:20,517 --> 00:39:22,976
While the world is making love,

992
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,631
Misery is making trouble.

993
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,976
I'm going to burn
this rose farm to the ground

994
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,941
and build
a fudge packing factory

995
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:33,734
where a fudge packing factory
ought to be!

996
00:39:33,758 --> 00:39:36,286
It's gonna take
a Valentine's Day miracle

997
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,872
to save the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm.

998
00:39:39,896 --> 00:39:41,700
Misery wants
to close down the farm

999
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:44,320
and open
a fudge packing factory.

1000
00:39:44,344 --> 00:39:46,562
Just as I suspected!

1001
00:39:46,586 --> 00:39:48,355
If only there was some way

1002
00:39:48,379 --> 00:39:50,113
to get Misery to rediscover

1003
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,182
the true meaning
of Valentine's Day.

1004
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:55,113
Well, ain't that what
your bow and arrow is for?

1005
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:58,389
Child, how do you even
get outta bed in the morning?

1006
00:39:58,413 --> 00:39:59,390
I don't know.

1007
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:01,424
Sometimes it takes an old flame

1008
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:02,941
to melt a cold heart.

1009
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,010
Ash?

1010
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,631
Cupid's arrow, hit your mark.

1011
00:40:05,655 --> 00:40:09,182
Make this big old ash tree talk!

1012
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,562
I've been tree-incarnated!

1013
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:16,044
Misery, why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

1014
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:17,976
I was rooting for us.

1015
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,665
The love between a girl
and a tree, it was forbidden.

1016
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:22,803
You were a coward.

1017
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:25,217
How dare you!

1018
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:26,424
Oh!

1019
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:29,044
My bark is worse than your bite!

1020
00:40:29,068 --> 00:40:31,044
Oh! [all laugh]

1021
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:33,665
I've always been here,
pining for you.

1022
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:36,907
Don't get sappy
with me, Ash. [sobs]

1023
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:38,355
Misery Love's Company

1024
00:40:38,379 --> 00:40:41,182
will make you believe
in love all over again.

1025
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:42,803
I'm in love with Ash Tree,

1026
00:40:42,827 --> 00:40:44,976
and I don't care
if the whole world knows it!

1027
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,217
[gasps] Does this mean

1028
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:48,217
you're not going to burn down

1029
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:51,286
the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm?

1030
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,803
The rose farm
belongs to you now.

1031
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:55,976
Well, I have a surprise, too.

1032
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,734
I'm not really dying. Yeah!

1033
00:40:57,758 --> 00:41:00,148
Yeah! Hey!

1034
00:41:00,172 --> 00:41:03,251
But wait. It wouldn't be
a RuPaulmark holiday movie

1035
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:05,803
without one more
ridiculous twist.

1036
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,010
Brrrrrr!

1037
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,665
I guess I should have told you.

1038
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,148
I'm really a prince.

1039
00:41:10,172 --> 00:41:11,458
The only thing
I love more than trees

1040
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:13,044
is a hot, rich prince.

1041
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:15,596
Stop. You're giving me a woody.

1042
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:18,803
[all laugh]

1043
00:41:18,827 --> 00:41:21,493
Even though we gave away
the whole damn plot,

1044
00:41:21,517 --> 00:41:26,286
watchMisery Love's Company,
only on the RuPaulmark Channel.

1045
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,838
[applause]

1046
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,458
Oh, my God.

1047
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:37,734
Our next film stars Symone,
LaLa Ri, Utica, and Rosé.

1048
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:39,389
Announcer: This Flag Day,

1049
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,631
get ready to fall in love
with yourself all over again

1050
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:44,586
in the RuPaulmark original...

1051
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,907
Meet Red Flag of the famous
flag-making Flag family.

1052
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:54,148
I hate flags, and I hate myself.

1053
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:56,872
When she receives
a desperate text,

1054
00:41:56,896 --> 00:42:00,562
Red rushes home to
the Flag family flag factory.

1055
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,251
Red, thank goodness you're home.

1056
00:42:02,275 --> 00:42:06,217
The bank is foreclosing
on the Flag family flag factory.

1057
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,734
I know you left town years ago,

1058
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:11,044
but you still own
half of the flag factory.

1059
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:12,527
Correction.

1060
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:15,044
I own 51% of the flag factory.

1061
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,631
And the only reason I came back
is to shut it down.

1062
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:19,458
As of midnight tonight,

1063
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:22,217
I'll be tearing down
the flag factory,

1064
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,044
and I'll be putting up
a wall factory

1065
00:42:24,068 --> 00:42:26,148
where a wall factory
ought to be!

1066
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:28,320
Sometimes it takes an old flag

1067
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:31,217
to show the children
how it's really done.

1068
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:34,458
You can't make someone
love flags.

1069
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:36,113
You've got to be born that way.

1070
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:40,286
When I was younger,
I hid my true colors, too.

1071
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,700
What helped you come out?

1072
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:44,148
Picture it. Summer '69.

1073
00:42:44,172 --> 00:42:47,424
I came across
the most beautiful flag.

1074
00:42:47,448 --> 00:42:51,872
Well hung, and a nice pole, too.

1075
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:53,389
Are we still talking
about flags?

1076
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:55,631
With time running out,

1077
00:42:55,655 --> 00:42:58,976
can a magical lawn ornament
save Flag Day?

1078
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,148
Must be walls!

1079
00:43:01,172 --> 00:43:03,493
Hello up there!

1080
00:43:03,517 --> 00:43:04,562
Do I know you?

1081
00:43:04,586 --> 00:43:08,034
I'm Gnomey.

1082
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,458
The gnome.

1083
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:13,700
Oh, Gnomey!

1084
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:16,941
How long you had
your finger in that dike?

1085
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:20,458
Anyway, this may sound
a little queer,

1086
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:23,251
but I'm scared
to let my true colors show.

1087
00:43:23,275 --> 00:43:26,355
I'm just scared I won't fit in.

1088
00:43:26,379 --> 00:43:32,251
Bitch, you are perfect
just the way you are!

1089
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:35,665
God Loves Flags
will make you laugh and cry

1090
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:37,389
and wonder if Flag Day

1091
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,941
is really some secret gay thing.

1092
00:43:39,965 --> 00:43:41,838
Something's different about you.

1093
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:44,389
I will not be shutting down
the flag factory.

1094
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:48,769
And I'm ready
to let my freak flag fly!

1095
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,424
It's a coming-out present!

1096
00:43:50,448 --> 00:43:52,148
I love it!

1097
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:53,458
I wish every day were Flag Day!

1098
00:43:53,482 --> 00:43:54,907
[all laugh]

1099
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:57,217
You've already figured out
how it ends,

1100
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:58,631
but we'll tell you anyway.

1101
00:43:58,655 --> 00:44:01,527
Here, pull my finger!

1102
00:44:01,551 --> 00:44:02,976
[farts]

1103
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,182
[pop]

1104
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:06,734
Wait a minute. You a prince?

1105
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:09,803
You loving yourself
freed me, too.

1106
00:44:09,827 --> 00:44:12,838
Red, will you marry me?

1107
00:44:12,862 --> 00:44:16,803
I mean, you hot and all,
but I'm into women, so...

1108
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:18,665
Yes!

1109
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,389
[both laugh]

1110
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:24,907
WatchGod Loves Flags
only on the RuPaulmark Channel,

1111
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:26,803
where the holidays
aren't just gay,

1112
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:29,044
they're super gay.

1113
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:32,665
[cheers and applause]

1114
00:44:32,689 --> 00:44:37,079
Our final film stars Gottmik,
Tina Burner,

1115
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:41,976
Joey Jay, Kandy Muse,
and Tamisha Iman.

1116
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,665
Announcer: Coming April 1st,
the joke's on you

1117
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:46,310
if you don't fall in love in...

1118
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:49,872
Meet April Fool.

1119
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,769
She hates April Fool's Day.

1120
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:56,941
I hate April Fool's Day,
and I hate pranks.

1121
00:44:56,965 --> 00:45:00,941
The former small-town
prankster is now a cutthroat lawyer

1122
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,320
for the Humorless
Ice Cream company.

1123
00:45:03,344 --> 00:45:07,251
April, we're just
one building away

1124
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:10,217
from putting up
a Humorless Ice Cream factory

1125
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:14,803
where a Humorless
Ice Cream factory ought to be.

1126
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:18,113
Who are the suckers
you want me to 86, boss?

1127
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:21,389
The Fools Rush In
novelty shoppe. Heard of it?

1128
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:23,355
Yes, I have.

1129
00:45:23,379 --> 00:45:25,079
But I'm an ambitious lawyer,

1130
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:26,734
and I have no trouble

1131
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:30,941
destroying my family's
novelty gift shoppe.

1132
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:32,907
And I'm not joking, bitch!

1133
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:38,769
You have till April 1st
to get me the deed.

1134
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:42,596
Is the plot of this movie
perfectly clear to you?

1135
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,079
This fool's errand
soon puts April

1136
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:48,734
between a rock
and a hardy-har place.

1137
00:45:48,758 --> 00:45:51,562
April, you're home.

1138
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:52,734
Put it here!

1139
00:45:52,758 --> 00:45:55,217
[buzzing] Unh! Aah-aah-aah!

1140
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:59,286
Gotcha! You looked like
you could use a good laugh.

1141
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,838
I'm here because I have
some papers for you to sign.

1142
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:05,458
Nothing to worry about.

1143
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:07,389
Now, where
is my Whoopie Cushion?

1144
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:08,838
[farting]

1145
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:12,665
Hey! Did someone
say my name? Aah!

1146
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:15,562
Oh, Whoopie,
my favorite employee,

1147
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:18,458
meet my ambitious granddaughter.

1148
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:20,493
You look like
you could use a laugh.

1149
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:23,389
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

1150
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:25,907
When was the last time someone
tickled your funny bone?

1151
00:46:25,931 --> 00:46:29,241
If you know what I'm saying, oh!

1152
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:32,355
Ah-whoo! Ah-whoo!

1153
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:35,148
Come on, bitch! Whoo!

1154
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,424
With hours
until April Fool's Day,

1155
00:46:37,448 --> 00:46:41,044
can a cheap Cher impersonation
change April's fortune?

1156
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:43,355
[imitating Cher] Whoa!

1157
00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:46,389
Hey, April, why so dark, lady?

1158
00:46:46,413 --> 00:46:50,217
Am I doing the right thing by
stealing my granny's shoppe?

1159
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:53,010
After the apocalypse,
three things remain.

1160
00:46:53,034 --> 00:46:56,148
Laughter, love...

1161
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:57,149
and Cher.

1162
00:46:57,173 --> 00:46:58,286
Whoa!

1163
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:02,148
So don't be a bitch, bitch.

1164
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:04,700
April's Fool's Paradise
will make you cry,

1165
00:47:04,724 --> 00:47:06,320
drunk-text your ex,

1166
00:47:06,344 --> 00:47:08,596
and wonder,
"Did I miss something?"

1167
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,217
Happy April Fool's Day,
everyone!

1168
00:47:11,241 --> 00:47:13,596
April, where's the deed?

1169
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,286
There is no deed. Take this!

1170
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,251
Oh!

1171
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:20,631
It's too late.
I signed the deed.

1172
00:47:20,655 --> 00:47:23,182
Joke's on you, April.

1173
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:25,320
You're fired!

1174
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:28,389
I've ruined everything!

1175
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:29,838
April Fools!

1176
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:33,665
Sasha signed the deed
with disappearing ink!

1177
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:35,355
Gotcha!

1178
00:47:35,379 --> 00:47:36,527
[all laugh]

1179
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:37,803
Wait a minute.

1180
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,148
The movie's almost over,

1181
00:47:39,172 --> 00:47:41,010
and April hasn't found
her secret prince.

1182
00:47:41,034 --> 00:47:43,665
I have just
one more wish to make.

1183
00:47:43,689 --> 00:47:45,931
Don't tell me.
You wish you had a prince.

1184
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,596
Oh, are you a real prince?

1185
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,182
Well, I'm a Prince impersonator.

1186
00:47:52,206 --> 00:47:53,941
Let's go crazy!

1187
00:47:53,965 --> 00:47:56,562
Gotcha! Whoa!

1188
00:47:56,586 --> 00:47:58,941
Don't missApril Fools Rush In,

1189
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:01,527
coming to the RuPaulmark

Ho! Ho-ho! Ho!

1191
00:48:02,862 --> 00:48:06,010
[chuckles] April Fools!

1192
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:08,355
[laughter and applause]

1193
00:48:08,379 --> 00:48:10,838
Brava, ladies, brava.

1194
00:48:10,862 --> 00:48:13,424
I smell a Cable ACE award
in your future.

1195

1197
00:48:16,586 --> 00:48:18,596
You are the Soul Train,
I tell you.

1198
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:19,838
You were a joy to watch.

1199
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:21,769
You were
out of your comfort zone.

1200
00:48:21,793 --> 00:48:22,770
It was a struggle.

1201
00:48:22,794 --> 00:48:25,172
[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]

1202
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:29,251
[RuPaul laughs]

1203
00:48:29,275 --> 00:48:33,620
Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

1204
00:48:34,965 --> 00:48:37,310
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1205
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:41,113

[all laugh]

1212
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:57,700
Ladies, you are...

1213
00:48:57,724 --> 00:48:58,724
safe.

1214
00:48:59,793 --> 00:49:01,113
Thank you.

1215
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:02,562
Some really great work
this week.

1216
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:04,562
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1217
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:05,724
You may leave the stage.

1218
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,251
Queens, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1219
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:18,034
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1220
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:22,389
Starting with Denali.

1221
00:49:22,413 --> 00:49:24,527
- I love your train look.
- Thank you, Ross.

1222
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:27,596
This has a lot of whimsy,
but it's also beautiful.

1223
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,044
You just look like
a beautiful bird.

1224
00:49:29,068 --> 00:49:32,596
Your performance,
you have an opening line

1225
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,044
that is a legendary
Bette Davis line,

1226
00:49:35,068 --> 00:49:36,596
[imitating Bette Davis]
which is, "What a dump!"

1227
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,907
Right.

1228
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:39,320
And I didn't get that.

1229
00:49:39,344 --> 00:49:41,320
I think you could have
gone way further with it.

1230
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:44,079
When you choose the big part,
the main character,

1231
00:49:44,103 --> 00:49:46,010
you've got a lot of work
to do through every scene.

1232
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,838
- But it was a struggle.
- Okay.

1233
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:51,976
You have to find a way to make
the character interesting.

1234
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,286
Some of these other girls
managed to do that.

1235
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,148
All right, Kahmora Hall.

1236
00:49:57,172 --> 00:50:01,320
This outfit, you embraced your
culture and you look fabulous.

1237
00:50:01,344 --> 00:50:06,424
Your performance, however,
was a little... flat.

1238
00:50:06,448 --> 00:50:09,458
Why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

1239
00:50:09,482 --> 00:50:11,631
I wanted you to be ridiculous,
I wanted you to let go.

1240
00:50:11,655 --> 00:50:12,803
You gotta take it
and run with it,

1241
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:14,838
like you do with your fashion.

1242
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:16,527
You're so buttoned up,

1243
00:50:16,551 --> 00:50:18,458
and I feel like
you struggle with that.

1244
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,551
But art is about
not being afraid.

1245
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,389
Kahmora, what's going on?

1246
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:28,113
You're right.

1247
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:30,079
Like, I try to be perfect
all the time,

1248
00:50:30,103 --> 00:50:33,389
and even just, like,
watching the video,

1249
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:34,631
I can see in my mind

1250
00:50:34,655 --> 00:50:36,631
that I'm, like,
thinking too much about it

1251
00:50:36,655 --> 00:50:37,976
and afraid to let go.

1252
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,389
I don't know why I'm struggling

1253
00:50:39,413 --> 00:50:41,389
with, like,
feeling confident inside,

1254
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,527
but not showing it
on the outside to you all.

1255
00:50:44,551 --> 00:50:46,665
Well, it's amazing that
you've been given the gift

1256
00:50:46,689 --> 00:50:50,424
to see where
the mistake was in that.

1257
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:52,286
Thank you.

1258
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,872
All right.
From Arkansas, Symone.

1259
00:50:55,896 --> 00:50:57,010
This has never been done
on the runway,

1260
00:50:57,034 --> 00:51:01,010
using a freaking durag
as a train?

1261
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:02,079
[all laugh]

1262
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:03,389
Get into it.

1263
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:05,838
You are the Soul Train,
I tell you.

1264
00:51:05,862 --> 00:51:07,596
[laughs] Yes, ma'am.

1265
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,700
You have been able
to take the genius

1266
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:12,458
of embracing your culture.

1267
00:51:12,482 --> 00:51:14,872
This is what America is about.

1268
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:16,665
Let's talk about the challenge.

1269
00:51:16,689 --> 00:51:19,424
You came out ready to go.

1270
00:51:19,448 --> 00:51:20,872
You had your lines,
you had the character.

1271
00:51:20,896 --> 00:51:24,044
You got
the Julia Sugarbaker role.

1272
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:26,665
What I loved was that
you infused it with you.

1273
00:51:26,689 --> 00:51:30,458
Even the way you just
said words so stupidly.

1274
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:31,493
[all laugh]

1275
00:51:31,517 --> 00:51:33,355
- Flag fact'ry."
- "Fact'ry."

1276
00:51:33,379 --> 00:51:35,769
So wrong it's right.

1277
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:37,424
Thank you.

1278
00:51:37,448 --> 00:51:41,803
Up next, LaLa Ri.
Oh, my goodness, this outfit.

1279
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:45,286
Mm-mm, I could use that
for Sunday brunch for real.

1280
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,838
[all laugh]

1281
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:48,596
I wanna talk about
your performance.

1282
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,527
You came in kind of quiet,

1283
00:51:50,551 --> 00:51:53,113
almost like you weren't
sure of yourself.

1284
00:51:53,137 --> 00:51:54,734
You were out of your
comfort zone, am I right?

1285
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:56,389
Yeah, you're correct.

1286
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,838
It showed on your face, and I
think you kind of went within.

1287
00:51:58,862 --> 00:52:00,631
And I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice.

1288
00:52:00,655 --> 00:52:02,769
When I was doing Soul Plane,

1289
00:52:02,793 --> 00:52:06,010
Mo'Nique knew
it was my first time doing it,

1290
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:09,458
and she said, "Make sure that
whatever you did to get here,

1291
00:52:09,482 --> 00:52:10,803
you keep doing it."

1292
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,562
Thank you.

1293
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:14,424
Up next, Rosé.

1294
00:52:14,448 --> 00:52:16,596
Tonight on the runway,
this is fun.

1295
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:18,631
It's not my favorite to me,

1296
00:52:18,655 --> 00:52:19,665
because I feel like
I'm looking at a suit

1297
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:21,527
with just an attachment on it.

1298
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:23,700
This is good. I just wanted
more, more, more.

1299
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,562
But Gnomey was super fun.

1300
00:52:25,586 --> 00:52:27,665
Gnomey!

1301
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:29,493
The gnome.

1302
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:30,941
Talk about weird.

1303
00:52:30,965 --> 00:52:32,562
I mean, you're on your knees,
shooting as a gnome.

1304
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:34,320
I loved your characterization.

1305
00:52:34,344 --> 00:52:36,527
You were so easy to direct.

1306
00:52:36,551 --> 00:52:38,010
I didn't know you had
all that acting skill in you.

1307
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:40,700
Even though
you were just static,

1308
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:44,665
you were still able to bring
life into your character.

1309
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:46,113
And I can't wait
to see more of you.

1310
00:52:46,137 --> 00:52:47,769
Thank you so much.

1311
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,631
Up next, Kandy Muse.

1312
00:52:49,655 --> 00:52:50,941
Tonight on the runway,

1313
00:52:50,965 --> 00:52:52,700
your train look doesn't
really say train for me.

1314
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:56,562
I think my issue with it, Kandy,
is it's a little too plain.

1315
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:57,700
- Okay.
- On the side,

1316
00:52:57,724 --> 00:52:59,769
I don't wanna see your cincher

1317
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:01,769
or your undergarments
sticking out

1318
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:03,217
I know. I was gonna
pull it down,

1319
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:05,631
but my little beef tenderonis
were gonna come out,

1320
00:53:05,655 --> 00:53:07,458
and I was trying
to keep it family friendly.

1321
00:53:07,482 --> 00:53:08,941
[all laugh]

1322
00:53:08,965 --> 00:53:13,044
Now, you were ridiculous
as Whoopie Cushion.

1323
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,700
Whoo! Whoo!

1324
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,251
You were committed
to the character,

1325
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:18,148
it was colorful, it was you.

1326
00:53:18,172 --> 00:53:19,976
Your performance
is a perfect example

1327
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,010
of how if you just give in
to the moment and get loose,

1328
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,976
you can really strike gold.

1329
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,148
Laugh out loud funny,
Kandy Muse.

1330
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:30,551
Very well did.

1331
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,355
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1332
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:36,907
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1333
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:39,068
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1334
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:44,424
All right, now just
between us flag hags,

1335
00:53:44,448 --> 00:53:45,596
whaddaya think?

1336
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,182
Denali.

1337
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:49,631
Denali is so good,
but I think she just bit off

1338
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:52,355
a bit more than
she could chew this week.

1339
00:53:52,379 --> 00:53:55,700
Also, she didn't have
the gay cultural references

1340
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:57,355
that you kind of have to have
to know those lines.

1341
00:53:57,379 --> 00:53:58,527
Yeah.

1342
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:01,493
I mean, that was, like, come on.

1343
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:02,734
Kahmora Hall.

1344
00:54:02,758 --> 00:54:04,700
Ladies, it was tough
directing her.

1345
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:07,458
I mean, I literally
pulled that out of her.

1346
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:08,872
I was exhausted.

1347
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:10,665
I needed a coffee,
I needed a shot,

1348
00:54:10,689 --> 00:54:12,527
I needed a deep-tissue massage.

1349
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:14,872
And that's what we got.

1350
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:16,320
I think she broke tonight.

1351
00:54:16,344 --> 00:54:19,389
I think that that means
there's room for improvement.

1352
00:54:19,413 --> 00:54:22,596
She doesn't feel safe enough
to just trust herself.

1353
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,251
This girl knows fashion,

1354
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:27,251
but tonight, that acting
challenge was pretty tough.

1355
00:54:27,275 --> 00:54:29,286
- Symone.
- She had an idea

1356
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,079
of what she wanted to do
in this acting challenge,

1357
00:54:31,103 --> 00:54:33,079
and she executed it perfectly.

1358
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,182
I love it!

1359
00:54:34,206 --> 00:54:35,803
Symone is a perfect example

1360
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,458
of someone
who trusts their instinct,

1361
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,631
who's done her homework

1362
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:43,113
and knows that she's gonna bring
Symone to every challenge.

1363
00:54:43,137 --> 00:54:44,665
Symone is my cousin.

1364
00:54:44,689 --> 00:54:45,976
[all laugh]

1365
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,527
That's Detroit all day.
Blow it out.

1366
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,010
We take fashion risks.

1367
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:53,976
Do not be surprised
if you see Rihanna

1368
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,941
with this long train durag,
all right?

1369
00:54:56,965 --> 00:54:58,320
Because it's gonna happen,
people.

1370
00:54:58,344 --> 00:55:00,182
LaLa Ri.

1371
00:55:00,206 --> 00:55:02,044
She was the weakest
of the group.

1372
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:04,907
But with that said,
she still was not terrible.

1373
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:06,355
She wasn't popping.

1374
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:08,769
And if she's fading
in the background this early,

1375
00:55:08,793 --> 00:55:09,872
that worries me.

1376
00:55:09,896 --> 00:55:12,872
She is too good to fade.

1377
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:14,596
Rosé.

1378
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:15,941
I loved her performance.

1379
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:18,389
Her performance was A1.
It was funny.

1380
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:19,838
She was so wonderful.

1381
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:21,976
I loved all her little bits
that she did.

1382
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,493
She was ready
for that challenge,

1383
00:55:23,517 --> 00:55:25,562
and she is ready
for this competition.

1384
00:55:25,586 --> 00:55:26,665
Watch out for her.

1385
00:55:26,689 --> 00:55:29,079
Kandy Muse.

1386
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:30,941
She knows how to bring comedy.

1387
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:33,182
She knows how to bring life.

1388
00:55:33,206 --> 00:55:34,596
She infused herself in it,

1389
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,044
and that's how you excel
in these acting challenges.

1390
00:55:37,068 --> 00:55:39,907
However, tonight on the runway,

1391
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:42,182
it was just messy for me.

1392
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:44,493
Yeah, the outfit
needed some adjustments.

1393
00:55:44,517 --> 00:55:46,562
But she is just hilarious.

1394
00:55:46,586 --> 00:55:49,251
Let's just give her some pins
to hide her undergarments.

1395
00:55:49,275 --> 00:55:51,217
[all laugh]

1396
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:54,482
Silence. I've made my decision.

1397
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,517
Aah!

1398
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,838
Okay.

1399
00:56:01,862 --> 00:56:03,172

I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1429

not only to fight for my
position in this competition,

but to prove to these girls

1441
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:06,700
that have never seen me
in my element

1442
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:08,251
that I'm an actual threat,

1443
00:58:08,275 --> 00:58:11,493

go against me, its over.

My biggest lesson learned

is that I need
to believe in myself.
