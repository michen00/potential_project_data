Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:05,515
You'll be performing
the song Phenomenon.

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:08,852
♪ Drag is all over the world ♪

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:11,855
♪ It's a phenomenon ♪

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,857
Rosé.

6
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,592
Your voice is beautiful.

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,360
Denali.

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,163
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,333
You're a winner, baby.

10
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,902
The rest of you are safe.

11
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:30,264
But starting next week,
heads will roll.

12
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:39,883
Girl, the winner's circle
is here

13
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,318
waiting for the B squad
to walk in,

14
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,687
and right now, all
I can think about is, bitch,

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,155
we look motherfucking good,

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,491
and these girls are about
to gag when they walk in.

17
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,651
It's gonna be the face crack
of the century.

18
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,062
Are you girls
excited to see the girls

19
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,764
that you specifically sent home?

20
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,199
Yes.

21
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,534
I feel like they gonna come
in being like daggers.

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,236
Well, I mean,
they already lost one,

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,305
so you already know they're
coming in here with a vengeance.

24
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,573
- With a vengeance.
- Right, exactly.

25
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,908
You must be freaking out
a little bit.

26
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:08,578
I mean, it's more kind of,
like, a sickening feeling,

27
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:09,879
because I kinda get

28
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,916
to actually confront them
for the first time.

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,484
Yeah, y'all have
some shit to talk about.

30
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,586
Do you guys think I should be,
like, here when they come in?

31
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,955
I think you should hide, bitch.

32
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,123
You should hide.

33
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,324
I think you should gag
the girls and hide.

34
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,493
Yeah, go back there.

35
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:25,762
Oh, my God,
they're gonna fucking die.

36
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:27,263
- Y'all don't know I'm here.
- We don't know nothing.

37
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,264
Don't be over there laughing
either, Miss Two-Twos.

38
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,033
Elliott who?

39
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:32,602
Hiding Elliott is so devious.

40
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,661
This is so much fun.

41
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,798
All right, girls,
put your faces on.

42
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,881
Okay, that's what's up.

43
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,483
Oh, look.

44
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,152
I see.

45
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,386
We walk into the werkroom

46
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,423
and the fucking other half
of the cast is there

47
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,092
staring at us
like fucking predators.

48
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,927
What's up, girls?

49
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,928
What up, bitches?

50
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,396
Come on, come over here,
come over here!

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,032
If it isn't the B squad!

52
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,001
Oh!

53
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,469
Oh, so that's how it is?

54
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,338
- No, that's not how it is!
- Okay.

55
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:11,941
If it isn't the "anywhere
to go but down" squad.

56
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,979
The other group feels like

57
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,348
there's this,
like, high-noseness.

58
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,618
There is this, like,
air of, mm, we beat you,

59
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,455
and you're gonna go home again.

60
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,557
- Who won y'all's lip sync?
- I did.

61
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,492
Who's the winner over here?

62
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,485
- All right!
- Okay.

63
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,966
Listen, I love to stir the pot.

64
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,501
Wait, the real question
is, though,

65
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,304
so I know some of y'all
sent one girl home, okay?

66
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,405
I sent two girls home.

67
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:45,508
So Miss Kahmora Hall,
if you're here,

68
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,909
what'd you do with Elliott?

69
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,145
We had to send one of us home,

70
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,016
and unfortunately,
we ended up deciding on Elliott.

71
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,283
What did you judge it on, like...

72
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,418
First impressions.

73
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,787
What was her impression
that sent her home?

74
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:58,788
Um...

75
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,189
- Elliott?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,050
Um... that.

77
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:07,163
I just didn't really get
what her drag style was.

78
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,198
I'm just like, mm, mm, mm.

79
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,335
Ooh, this is tasty, girl. Ha!

80
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,837
What's up, B squad?

81
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,475
How we doing?

82
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,978
Y'all didn't expect to see me,
did you?

83
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,914
The Porkchop queens are gooped

84
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,883
when they see Elliott walk out.

85
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,218
So we have a lot to talk about.

86
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,486
Ooh! Come on, bitch!

87
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,155
Lay it on the table.

88
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,489
When it really comes down to it,

89
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,691
I didn't have any time
to talk about myself,

90
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,560
because I was the last one
in the room.

91
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,829
Kahmora already knew
someone else,

92
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,098
so she already was kind of,
like, good up in the gig.

93
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,199
It was no malice behind it.

94
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,567
It was gonna
have to be one of us.

95
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,768
So why didn't you jump up?

96
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,503
Oh!

97
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,338
Because they didn't vote me.

98
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,406
They voted you.

99
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,342
She attacked the wrong one.

100
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,512
All these chihuahuas beside me,
you gonna go for the pit bull?

101
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,680
No, ma'am.

102
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,649
I know Tamisha Iman
from back in Atlanta,

103
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,009
and that bitch likes to fight.

104
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,123
It was kind of shocking
when it was unanimous for me

105
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,491
when y'all didn't know
nothing about me.

106
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,861
But, you know, now I have
a first impression of all y'all,

107
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,863
so it is what it is.

108
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:14,955
Okay.

109
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,571
Ooh, you girls are spicy, bitch.

110
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:22,472
I think the other girls

111
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,040
feel as though they have
the upper edge on us

112
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,708
because they won
their challenge.

113
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,710
Now we are all
the Season 13 sisters.

114
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:30,246
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

115
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,805
Season 13, bitches!

116
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,976
There's several more rounds
to go in this race.

117
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,356
The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race

118
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,891
receives a one-year supply

119
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,360
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

120
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,197
and a cash prize of $100.000.

121
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,634
With extra-special guest judge
Loni Love.

126
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,084
We're still here!

127
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,254
Walking into this werkroom,
I think that the competition

128
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,256
is about to get
next fucking level.

129
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,658
We've got both groups together.

130
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,260
Bitch, the room
is so full right now.

131
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,228
So I'm gonna
have to work really hard

132
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,664
to give 'em the that Joey Jay
experience, girl.

133
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,834
- This is a diverse cast.
- It's a cute cast.

134
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,418
Who's single?
Who's single in the group?

135
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,272
Single-single! You are single.

136
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,007
You're single-single. Single?

137
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,108
You're single.

138
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,245
Oh, my God, Joey Jay is so cute.

139
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,980
And so feminine.
I love feminine boys.

140
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,283
What made you scamper away?

141
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,018
Kandy Muse is, like,

142
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:46,656
a fun, rambunctious,
like, kid on the schoolyard.

143
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,757
You know, I like that bitch.

144
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,525
If I ain't gonna win the crown,

145
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,561
I'm gonna win a man.

146
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,997
Based on Kandy's reputation
in New York, I was worried.

147
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,067
And so I almost feel a little
bad, because I judged her.

148
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,503
I'm gonna say
you heard it here first.

149
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,330
Tina Burner and Kandy Muse
are kiki sisters.

150
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,611
Hello, hello, hello!

151
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,380
You better come on!

152
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,351
All my queens, together at last.

153
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,419
- Yes!
- Yes!

154
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,087
Now, as much as we've enjoyed

155
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,956
taking the time to get to know

156
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,160
your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent intimately,

157
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:28,331
from this moment on,
we're putting the elimination

158
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:32,535
back into this competition
officially.

159
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,605
That's right.
Before this week is over,

160
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:38,565
one of you will be going home
for good.

161
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:47,650
Well, now that I've put you
all in a festive spirit...

162
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,285
for this week's maxi-challenge

163
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,122
you'll be starring
in cheesy holiday movies

164
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,827
for my new media venture,
the RuPaulmark Channel.

165
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,265
But we ain't doin'
one of those Christmas movies.

166
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,400
Uh-uh. No, ma'am.

167
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,436
We are disrupting
the marketplace

168
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,472
with films that celebrate

169
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,141
all the other holidays
of the year.

170
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,177
Now, to mix up
the two groups of queens,

171
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,348
I've taken the liberty
to assign teams.

172
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,218
Shit. Here we go.

173
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,222
Then each team will assign
the individual roles.

174
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,525
The first team is Denali,
Elliott With 2 Ts,

175
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,262
Kahmora Hall, and Olivia Lux.

176
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,498
You'll be overacting

177
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,491
in the Valentine's Day
tearjerker...

178
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,572
Valentine.

179
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,877
All right, next team
is LaLa Ri, Rosé, Symone...

180
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,012
- Ooh.
- Yes, bitch.

181
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,280
And Utica.

182
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,150
Now, you'll be overacting

183
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:59,479
in a soon-to-be-classic
Flag Day romantic adventure...

184
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,161
And that means the third team

185
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:08,197
is Gottmik, Joey Jay,
Kandy Muse...

186
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,198
Eew.

187
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,390
Tamisha Iman...

188
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,570
And Tinta Burner.

189
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,771
Tsss!

190
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,675
You'll be acting a fool

191
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,779
in a rom-com that
celebrates April Fool's Day.

192
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,405
It's called...

193
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:33,255
Last but not least,
to help you get into character,

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,493
we've got wigs
provided by Wigs and Grace.

195
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,895
- All right.
- Yeah.

196
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,131
Racers, start your engines,

197
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,468
and may the best drag queen win!

198
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,072
Movie trailer one,

199
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,374
Valentine's Day,
Misery Loves Company.

200
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,209
Let's just read through it,
all right?

201
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:56,212
So Misery and Ash have a fight.
That's kind of fun.

202
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,814
I've never done
scripted acting before,

203
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:00,016
but I'm not afraid
of a challenge.

204
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,318
So I think I'll go ahead
and take Misery Love.

205
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,820
- You wanna be Misery?
- I kinda do.

206
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,222
Werk.

207
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,190
I wanna prove that I'm more
than just a lip sync artist,

208
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,191
that I can act.

209
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,526
I absolutely feel ready

210
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,861
to break into
the winner's circle.

211
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,630
I'm gonna fight
40 times harder now

212
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,767
to prove that I am a threat
in this competition.

213
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,669
And not just a safe threat.
I'm a top threat.

214
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,339
"Queen three,
Kewpie the Stupid Cupid.

215
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,507
Total airhead
with a heart of gold."

216
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,842
I feel that already.

217
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,179
Because I actually am stupid.

218
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,416
I love it!

219
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,583
There's just something
really annoying

220
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,585
about Elliott's voice
that I can't stand.

221
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,020
Oh, my God!

222
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,322
She uses the branch just like...

223
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,260
That kind of nasally, like...

224
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,328
Aah!

225
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,863
I can't.

226
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:49,999
Maybe we should just

227
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,901
read through the whole thing
by ourselves,

228
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,560
and then come together
at the end.

229
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,640
I realize that it's
obviously a main character,

230
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:58,841
but I didn't realize

231
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:01,577
how many lines
this character was gonna have.

232
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,412
This is a big role.

233
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,147
It's kind of overwhelming.

234
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,616
I definitely feel like
I have the biggest challenge

235
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,218
with this character, though.

236
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,921
Denali is definitely feeling it,

237
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,190
and I think she's
kind of second-guessing

238
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,982
the character she chose.

239
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:22,498
I should never have sent a fool
to do a woman's job!

240
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,833
I am so excited,

241
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:27,369
because we're gonna be filming
some cheesy television.

242
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,438
I hope I'm not
lactose intolerant.

243
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,174
We got Whoopie Cushion,
we have Party Clown, Party Lady.

244
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,810
"Everything she says
is delivered like a bad joke."

245
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,012
I definitely want
Whoopie Cushion, hands down.

246
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,882
The second I see
Miss Whoopie Cushion,

247
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,551
I don't even
let a girl get a chance.

248
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,652
Nope, she's mine.

249
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,488
Are you already
highlighting your lines?

250
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,223
- Mm-hmm.
- Bitch!

251
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,559
Bitch, this is Kandy Muse
on paper.

252
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,194
All right, so I'm definitely
happy with Whoopie.

253
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,330
She's just like,
"I'm highlighting,

254
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,865
this is my role,
get into it or get lost."

255
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,333
And I'm like,
well, props to you.

256
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,534
That was kind of everything.

257
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,736
But also, not sure
if that's how that works.

258
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,095
But okay.

259
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,708
God Loves Flags.

260
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,110
I wish every day were Flag Day!

261
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,411
I didn't know Flag Day
was a real holiday.

262
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:10,679
Like, this is news to me.

263
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,816
Honestly, we never
been out of school

264
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,151
for Flag Day, I don't think.

265
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,318
As of midnight tonight,

266
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm tearing down
the flag fixture

267
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,313
and putting a wall fixture
where the flag fix... wait.

268
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:26,061
Did you just call me a bitch?

269
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,364
We're doing an acting challenge.

270
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,733
That means that the actresses
are gonna come out to play.

271
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,334
Mayday! Mayday!

272
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,503
That means it's gonna be
between me and Tina.

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,909
I should never have sent a fool
to do a woman's job!

274
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,113
We are both actresses,
we've got big personalities.

275
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,650
I can already see her taking
the lead, being hilarious.

276
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,118
So just in the back of my mind,

277
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,854
I'm making sure that, like,
I'm doing the same exact thing.

278
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,090
Whoo-hoo!

279
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,360
Of course you know me.

280
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,565
Hi-ee!

281
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,900
- Hi!
- Hello.

282
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,403
How are my lipstick
thespians doing?

283
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:10,072
- Fantastic.
- Glossed and ready!

284
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,407
Nevah bettah.

285
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,309
All right, Flag team,
come on down.

286
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,044
Hey, let's do it!

287
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,145
Come on, flag.

288
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,214
God Loves Flags,
and that's the truth.

289
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,216
God do love some flags.

290
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,518
That's right.

291
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,987
Have you all spoken
with the other teams

292
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,255
and compared scripts?

293
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,958
- Mm-mm.
- Because little secret.

294
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:31,560
As with all of those
type of movies,

295
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,928
they're all very similar.

296
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,498
If not exactly the same.

297
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:39,969
So what we're looking for

298
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,738
is for you as an actor
to take this role

299
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,707
and turn it into something
really, really special.

300
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,309
- LaLa Ri!
- Yes, hunty!

301
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,310
Are those acrylics?

302
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,478
No, they're press-ons.

303
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,546
Are you wearing
press-on nails, too?

304
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,680
No, these I got her done.

305
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,815
- Those are acrylic.
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,483
For the look and feel of what?

307
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,710
A woman.

308
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,223
Okay.

309
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,025
And then there's that.

310
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,027
That's called
method acting, you know.

311
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,128
Oh, yes.

312
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,098
Where you embody
the character. Nice.

313
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,967
Now, Rosé, you have any
theater in your background?

314
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,770
I consider myself, even
through drag, an actor first.

315
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,306
- Oh, an actor first.
- An actor first, Mama.

316
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,008
So, now, Rosé and Utica,

317
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:22,578
you both voted for Elliott
With 2 Ts to go home.

318
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,081
What made you decide on Elliott?

319
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,717
I think that
between Elliott and I

320
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,552
there was just
a very different vibe.

321
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,979
I give a very warm energy and
she gives a very cold energy.

322
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,760
That's... That's interesting.

323
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,396
Utica, how do you feel
about this acting challenge?

324
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,998
I am playing
a token, token queen.

325
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,001
Oh, she tokes the marijuana.

326
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,727
Have you ever
smoked weed before?

327
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,732
Oh, my God, please do that
in your... your... your...

328
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,200
Just let it all out.

329
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,303
What it is that you do, do that.

330
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,504
All right, ladies,

331
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:25,407
Well, I'm gonna let you
get back to rehearsing.

332
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,475
I can't wait to see what you do.

333
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,976
- All right!
- Thanks, Ru.

334
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,645
Hey, April Fools.

335
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,413
- All right.
- Come on over.

336
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,382
- Miss Kandy Muse.
- Hi.

337
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,617
How short are those shorts
you have on?

338
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,020
Um... a little panty.

339
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,588
Well, it pays to advertise.

340
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,957
- Ooh!
- Yes.

341
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,125
Any acting in your background?

342
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,561
I mean, I act like
I like these girls here,

343
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,995
but besides that...

344
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,498
Because the thing is that
you have so much personality,

345
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,768
but can you turn it on
when they say "Okay, action."

346
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,570
All right, so now Miss Tamisha.

347
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,472
- Yes?
- What role are you playing?

348
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,107
I'm Zoltina.

349
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,675
That's the character
that's based on Cher.

350
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,311
Can I hear
a little bit of your Cher?

351
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,979
Snap out of it!

352
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,548
Yeah. Uh, yeah,
but better than that.

353
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,716
Whoa.

354
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,385
- Are you a Cher fan?
- I am.

355
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,622
Name five Cher songs,
but don't do Believe.

356
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,848
Um... um...

357
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,728
I would say Gypsy.

358
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,563
She's not a Cher fan.

359
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,732
- She ain't no Cher fan!
- I'm a Cher fan at heart.

360
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,567
- No, you ain't.
- Yes, I am.

361
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,904
Who are you a big fan of, where
you know everything about them?

362
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,140
It would be Gladys, Patti...

363
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,508
Natalie Cole.
I'm a big fan of Natalie Cole.

364
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,410
Okay. So make Natalie Cole Cher,

365
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,614
or your interpretation of Cher.

366
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:39,715
Gotcha.

367
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,083
You know, do it
however you can get there.

368
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,484
And this is for all y'all.

369
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,486
However you can get there,
get there.

370
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,623
So, Gottmik,
what role are you playing?

371
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,625
I'm playing April Fool.

372
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,926
You wound up with so many lines.

373
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,795
Will you be able
to remember them?

374
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:53,929
I have a pretty good memory,
so I think I got it.

375
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,130
You have a good memory.

376
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,900
So who were the three artists

377
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,203
Tamisha would have rather done.

378
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:03,305
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, Patti Labelle.

379
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,706
Uh-huh.

380
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,043
And then I got so distracted
by your gorgeous pussy bow, I...

381
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,948
- There goes the memory.
- It's all in here.

382
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,752
I cannot wait to see what
you all do with these roles.

383
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,288
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

384
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,325
Hey, ladies, listen up.

385
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:28,397
Tomorrow on the runway,
category is Trains For Days.

386
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,335
Now remember, whatever you do,
don't fuck it up.

387
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,428
All right, bye.

388
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:43,078
It's time to shoot our drag
holiday movie
with the Ross Mathews.

389
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,514
I am feeling boss-ass bitch.

390
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,449
Get me a wire hanger!

391
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,183
I'm gonna beat the shit
outta somebody.

392
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,551
Hope you're ready to ham it up,

393
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,420
because ham goes
with every holiday.

394
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:55,557
And no pressure, but April
Fool's
is my favorite holiday.

395
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,892
Of course it is, yeah.

396
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,160
Places!

397
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,462
Ready and action.

398
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,865
We're just one building away

399
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,435
from putting up a humorous
ice cream factory

400
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,106
where a humorous ice cream
factory ought to be.

401
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,875
And I'm not joking, bitch!

402
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:15,277
I really love
the characterization.

403
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,912
Have fun with it. Sell it.

404
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,113
Mik, she's giving me, like,

405
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,282
Joan Cusack from
Addams Family Values,

406
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,085
and I'm, like,
almost peeing my pants.

407
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,454
And I'm not joking, bitch!

408
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,389
Even more gangster.
Give it to me bigger.

409
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,591
And I'm not joking, bitch!

410
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,326
Great.

411
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,528
Cut, print. Moving on.

412
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,031
All right,
let's give this a go. Action.

413
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,269
Zoltina, the fortune-telling
machine from New Orleans.

414
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,037
Whoa.

415
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,239
When you wake up,

416
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,842
I'd love it even more dramatic.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

417
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,044
- Okay.
- Action!

418
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,579
Whoa!

419
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:53,148
- Even bigger "whoa" from you.
- Okay.

420
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,416
Whoa!

421
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,853
Really exaggerate
the "oh-oh-oh."

422
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:01,156
How funny can you make whoa?

423
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,825
Whoa-ho-ho!

424
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,893
Do that one more time.
It was good!

425
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,629
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho.

426
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,564
Even longer than you think.

427
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,599
Okay.

428
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,368
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

429
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,938
Can you go higher with it? Whoa!

430
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,231
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

431
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,312
Yes, Tamisha is slaying it.

432
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:27,416
Ho-ho-ho. Ho-ho-ho-ho! Ho! Ho!

433
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,252
Ho! Ho! Ho!

434
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,620
Aah!

435
00:18:31,644 --> 00:18:33,855
We're in the Fools Rush In
novelty shoppe now.

436
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,891
Have fun with it. Action.

437
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:39,928
If it isn't my grandmother,
Sasha Fool.

438
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,331
You look like
you could use a good laugh.

439
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:44,700
Ugh.

440
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:46,001
Ha, gotcha!

441
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,303
You looked like
you could use a good laugh.

442
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,439
Wait, cut.

443
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,208
I think you said the same line.

444
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,643
- Yeah, I did.
- Okay.

445
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,411
I'm not gonna lie. I'm nervous.

446
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,813
You look like you could
have used a good laugh.

447
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:02,584
Cut. Make sure we're not seeing
your profile all the time.

448
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,044
You gotta stay out
to the cameras.

449
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,857
Do you know which camera
is your close-up camera?

450
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:12,294
No, I don't.

451
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,962
- This one?
- That's it.

452
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,230
When you're talking to April,

453
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,532
you're gonna cheat
to that camera.

454
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,567
Okay.

455
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,568
Make sure we can
understand everything.

456
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,736
And when you shake her hand,

457
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,705
make sure you're in there
so I can see it.

458
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,207
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay?

459
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,675
Okay.

460
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,176
Joey, stop looking to the side.

461
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,345
Don't look in the camera,
look past the camera.

462
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,680
Enunciate your words.

463
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:32,914
Do you remember
what the line is?

464
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,408
Okay, now I need you
to shake her hand.

465
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:39,021
This is how I feel.

466
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,022
Moving on.

467
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,924
Hey, did somebody
mention my name?

468
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,795
You look like
you could use a good laugh.

469
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,231
You know what I'm saying,
Oh... oh...

470
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,733
Whoo-hoo-whoo!

471
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:52,968
Come on, bitch!

472
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,169
Whoo!

473
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,338
Are they laughing?
Then I'm good.

474
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,408
Every single person
in this room is laughing.

475
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,610
Bitch, ballpark.

476
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,078
Outta the park.

477
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,213
Whatever that little
reference is, that.

478
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,883
All right, ladies,
that's a wrap!

479
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,421
- Hi-ee.
- Hello!

480
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,456
It's time to put it on

481
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,459
for the lights,
the camera, and the action.

482
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,595
First scene in the flag
factory shoppe. Action.

483
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,130
As of midnight tonight,

484
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,666
I am tearing down
the flag factory

485
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,001
and putting a wall factory

486
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,769
where a wall factory
ought to be!

487
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,105
Good?

488
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,574
Good rhythm, I gotta say!

489
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,608
- All right.
- Yes!

490
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,011
Symone was really quiet
in rehearsal.

491
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:39,347
All of a sudden, she's
the loudest bitch in the room.

492
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,050
I gotta make sure that
I'm as fierce as she is.

493
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,454
Okay, let's give it a go.
And action.

494
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,280
Hello up there!

495
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,459
Do I know you?

496
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:54,262
Honey, I'm a nonbinary,
three-foot gnome.

497
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,064
You can trust me.

498
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,468
It's really hard not
to break character sometimes,

499
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,070
because Rosé
as this gnome is sending me.

500
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,071
Good, ladies.

501
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,206
Yay.

502
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,875
Places! Action!

503
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:10,769
Mother Flag-g-g has arrived.

504
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,486
- "Have you seen my bong?"
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

505
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,787
I'm so sorry. Uh... shoot.

506
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,889
Uh...

507
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:24,392
And when I came across
that... no... no...

508
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,361
Uh, cut. So, just...

509
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,863
Do you need to look at a script?

510
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,932
Off to a great start.

511
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,301
Aah! I get really nervous,

512
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,838
and I forget all my lines.

513
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,474
All of them,
all three of my lines.

514
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,678
And action.

515
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,883
Mother Flag has arrived.

516
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,017
Now, where's my bong?

517
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,685
Not now, Mother.

518
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:54,013
Red is trying to shut down
the fa...

519
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,458
Not now, Mother.

520
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,093
Red's trying to shut down
flag factory.

521
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,227
What should we do?

522
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,662
Okay, cut. You're upset.

523
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,364
You know, like, be upset.

524
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,065
Some stuff's going down here.

525
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,934
- Be flustered.
- Okay.

526
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,336
Red is trying to shut down
the flag factory.

527
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,005
What should we do?

528
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,407
I'm a little worried for LaLa.

529
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,009
Her performance
is a little boring.

530
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,836
I wish every day were Flag Day!

531
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,482
Okay. Moving on.

532
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,917
I know Ross is probably
sitting here thinking, like,

533
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,385
what the fuck
is she doing, girl?

534
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,620
Like, who cast this ho?

535
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:28,623
- Hi, Ross.
- Hi, Ross!

536
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,593
Hi-ee! Are you ready to make
some holiday magic?

537
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:33,061
- Yes! Let's do this!
- Okay.

538
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,830
Places.

539
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,265
Misery, is that you?

540
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,035
I haven't seen you in 10 years!

541
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,171
When I heard you were
going to give the deed

542
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:48,577
to the Family Rose Garden
Bud Farm-fill Town Center...

543
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,711
Oh.

544
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,413
Yeah, you wanna take it again?

545
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:52,847
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

546
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:56,218
Rose Family
Valentine's Day rose farm.

547
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,886
Sorry, one more time.

548
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,323
Immediately,
I'm struggling with my lines.

549
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,291
This is hard boots.

550
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,793
And action!

551
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:08,430
I am going to build
fudge packer factories

552
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:11,299
where all fudge packer
factories should be.

553
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:14,002
Cut. Have you ever seen
Mommie Dearest?

554
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,036
I have.

555
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,271
Yeah, there's this scene
where she goes,

556
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:19,474
"I've put a window
where a window ought to be."

557
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,976
- Ought to be. Yes.
- Okay?

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,544
So it's very important
you get these lines right.

559
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,745
That I get that line, okay.

560
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:24,980
Because you're referencing
something iconic.

561
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:28,383
Right. I am going to build
a fudge packing factory

562
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,319
where a "fudge facking
pactory" ought to be!

563
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:35,257
Okay, cut. You said
"pack fashing facory."

564
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,650
No bueno. No bueno!

565
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:42,497
All right, ladies,
we're gonna meet the ash tree.

566
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,166
Kahmora's gonna be the tree.

567
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,068
It's, like, a lot of
green-screen work.

568
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,970
Even though she's in
a green screen suit,

569
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:54,075
Kahmora is in full drag body
for this with her breastplate.

570
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,343
You could have wore a boy body.

571
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,014
Action.

572
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,784
Misery, why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

573
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,286
Okay, cut.

574
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,221
- Ash?
- Yes.

575
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:08,156
You're giving
a really wooden performance.

576
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,293
Gimme little ups and downs.

577
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:12,694
- Got it, okay.
- Action!

578
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:15,864
Misery, why did you leaf me?

579
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,500
- I was rooting for us!
- Cut.

580
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,801
How would you say that line?

581
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,836
I was rooting for us!

582
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,305
How would Tyra Banks say it?

583
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:25,073
I was rooting for you.

584
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,541
Yeah, so what were you
gonna emphasize?

585
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,109
I was rooting for us.

586
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,978
- No.
- I'm sorry.

587
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,414
- I was rooting for us!
- Okay.

588
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,440
I was rooting for us!

589
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:37,085
Let's go right back to the top,

590
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,254
and you were rooting for us.

591
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:41,013
I was rooting for us.

592
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,849
I was rooting for us!

593
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,163
I was rooting for us!

594
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,734
Why do you keep saying
"I was rooting for us?"

595
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,236
I didn't realize I'm
emphasizing the wrong thing.

596
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,505
You're totally...
Like, over and over again.

597
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,506
I was rooting for us.

598
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,008
I was rooting for us.

599
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:01,443
I was rooting for us!

600
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,611
No. Say it...

601
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,213
I think I'm saying it right, no?

602
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,915
Tyra said,
"I was rooting for you."

603
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,784
So, say, I was rooting for us.

604
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,720
I was rooting for us.

605
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:12,987
Last chance,
and we gotta move on.

606
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,522
- Okay.
- Nail it.

607
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:18,193
Misery, why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

608
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,886
I was rooting for us.

609
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:23,989
Was that better?

610
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:30,638
She says it
probably, um, 78 times,

611
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,907
and she still doesn't get it?

612
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,343
I'm watching a train wreck
happen right in front of me.

613
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,613
That's it.
I'll see you on the runway.

614
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,939
I was rooting for her.

615
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,182
- ♪ Time to paint my face ♪
- Whoo, bitch, come on, ho!

616
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,361
Whoo! It is elimination day,

617
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:58,933
and it is officially time
for girls to start going home.

618
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,469
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
let's become women.

619
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,805
Or in Tina's case, softer.

620
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:05,106
Aah!

621
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,000
Shady!

622
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,880
Gimme the thread.

623
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,581
How you doing?
Are you all right?

624
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,817
I'm re-doing my train look

625
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,853
because my original one
is not going to work.

626
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,089
So I am using
a different one now,

627
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,925
and I'm trying to just
jimmy-rig it for the runway.

628
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,561
And Gottmik and Tina
are really helping me,

629
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,497
because, bitch, I was stressing
out and going through it.

630
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,500
Tina and Mik, those are
my, like, shady little bitches.

631
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:34,736
We're just so, like,
shady to each other.

632
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,704
Like, no one
understands our humor.

633
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:36,938
We just get each other.

634
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,773
Well, girl, you're
pulling it together, honey.

635
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,774
You're making it work.

636
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,109
- Thanks, Tim.
- Okay.

637
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,410
We'll see you on the runway.

638
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,612
Yeah.

639
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,916
Me and Kandy and Tina are
shade monsters all day together.

640
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,151
We just kiki
like no other bitch.

641
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,619
I love those ladies.

642
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,689
We are ride-or-dies forever.

643
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,357
Thank you. No, like,
really, really, like, thank you.

644
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,359
Girl, we're not gonna
let you walk out there

645
00:26:58,383 --> 00:26:59,494
looking like shit.

646
00:26:59,518 --> 00:27:00,728
- Look at that. Whoo!
- Honey.

647
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,097
Oh... my goodness.

648
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,299
Look at that.
Look at that. Perfection.

649
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:06,334
That looks so good!

650
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:09,304
Yes! Werk, bitches.

651
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:10,438
- Okay, let's fucking...
- All right.

652
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,197
All right, let's go get ready.

653
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,844
Symone, what was your
first time in drag like?

654
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,312
My first time,

655
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,813
I would go home
from school every day,

656
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,415
and I would do my makeup
before my parents came home.

657
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,516
One of my classmates was like,

658
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,052
"So you coming to prom
in drag, diva?"

659
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,321
And I was like,
"You know what? Yeah, I am."

660
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,756
And so my first time in drag,
I went to prom.

661
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,426
- What?
- Girl!

662
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,429
Yep. I saved up all my money,
my shekels, my coins.

663
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,731
I bought me a dress
off the sales rack,

664
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:42,136
I got me a shake-and-go wig,
and I put myself up in drag.

665
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,906
And then I went
into my high school prom.

666
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,608
The vice principal was like,
"Who is this?

667
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,343
I've never seen
this person before."

668
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,811
And the principal was like,
"That's Reggie.

669
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,479
"You know, that's Reggie
underneath there.

670
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,014
Go on in, Reggie,
have a good time."

671
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,482
And I was, like,
"All right, bitch."

672
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,550
Aw, so cute!

673
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:56,551
In Arkansas, too?

674
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,353
Oh, honey, I had no fear.

675
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,921
Drag, like, took that away.

676
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:02,390
All the fear that Reggie had,
Symone did not.

677
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,659
It was an empowering moment.

678
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,728
I felt good.

679
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,863
It was one of the first times
I felt seen.

680
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,033
It was the first time
I felt strong

681
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,592
and not scared to be myself.

682
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,306
Here's a question, y'all.

683
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,008
Has anyone ever dated a woman?

684
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,242
No!

685
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:22,777
A woman? Dated a woman?
I've never dated a woman.

686
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,512
I'm gold star over here.

687
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,713
I had mad girlfriends
when I was, like, young.

688
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,048
Me, too, though.

689
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,217
I have biological kids.

690
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:31,586
Wait! She got kids, bitch!

691
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,787
- What?
- Kids?

692
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,188
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah, I know, right?

693
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,790
I have three biological kids.

694
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,225
Aah! What?

695
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,993
My youngest is 33,

696
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:42,597
and the oldest
have just turned 35.

697
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:44,599
- What?
- Oh, my God.

698
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:47,402
My twins, I dated their mother
during high school.

699
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,004
After her,
went with another girl,

700
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:55,176
and my life
has just been a whirlwind.

701
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,680
Long story short,
I didn't realize that I was gay

702
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,214
until after
I got outta high school.

703
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,716
And do they know...
They know about the gay?

704
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,951
- They know you're, like...
- Yeah.

705
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:04,519
Are they gonna watch the show?

706
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:06,020
Sure.

707
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:09,390
After I parted with
the second baby mother,

708
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,292
I had a friend in Atlanta
that was gay.

709
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:14,095
So his thing was
let's just go hang out.

710
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,296
You know, let me
show you my world.

711
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,599
I don't know if he
saw something or whatever,

712
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,334
but nevertheless,
we went to the club.

713
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,636
To see guys dancing with guys,

714
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,605
that was amazing.

715
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:23,972
It was an "aha" moment.

716
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:27,575
Long story short, I started
doing drag when I was 20.

717
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,345
So my drag name actually comes
from my oldest daughter.

718
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,980
Your oldest biological daughter?

719
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:33,881
Yeah. Her name is Tamisha.

720
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,684
- Aw!
- Aw!

721
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,286
Is her middle name
"Coming For You?"

722
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,255
Tamisha Iman is coming for you!

723
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,890
Show the girls what art can do.

724
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,859
We weren't there,
so y'all can't sing that.

725
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,294
Yeah, thank you.

726
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,758
So then I better not hear any
"Symone's coming for the crown."

727
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:51,933
Well, 'cause she ain't.

728
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,768
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

729
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,571
It's a joke!

730
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,072
I said JK, Kahmora.

731
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,074
- Oh!
- It's Kah-mora.

732
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,413
And that is the night the lights
went out in the werkroom.

Loni, do you have

00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:13,981
Yes, Ru, Valentine's Day,

752
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,417
because I can get some roses
and some candy

753
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:19,420
and I get some... yeah.

00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,448
First up, Denali.

762
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,418
She looks like
she's trained a cockatoo.

763
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,920
I'm serving you
beautiful bird realness.

764
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,422
Quetzalcoatl is a deity

765
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,824
of Mesoamerican
and Mexican culture.

766
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,659
The Quetzal bird
has this sickening Mohawk

767
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:01,562
that both makes it really
elegant, but also really punk.

768
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,899
The trains for days are
beautiful ostrich feathers.

769
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,967
Not chicken, mama.

770
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:08,302
This is ostrich,
and I'm serving it.

771
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,439
Oh, my God, Michelle,
did she just flip you the bird?

772
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,573
She did!

I'm serving you
rococo, baroque, Beethoven.

776
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,852
I'm giving you all
the musical geniuses, okay?

777
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,121
She put the "ass"
in "classical."

Elliott With 2 Ts.

779
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,326
I guess the other "T"
is for "train."

And then this train
is sickening.

783
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,404
All the ruffles, all the tulle.

784
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,506
Girl, I am feeling myself.

785
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,574
Can you take one more spin?

786
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,242
You missed a spot
right over there.

I am feeling
so glamorous and beautiful.

Mother of Dragons.

Daenerys,
move out the way, bitch.

793
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:08,062
I know the judges
are feeling it.

794
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,831
Pick it up, girl.
You're dragon it.

795
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,734
Symone.

796
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:17,171
She comes from
the wrong side of the tracksuit.

797
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:22,143
A durag is a part
of Black culture,

798
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,912
and I wanted to celebrate that
on the stage.

799
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,614
Ain't nothin' wrong
with wearing no durag.

800
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:30,551
It is unapologetic,
and that is very Symone.

801
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,720
Du your thang, Symone!

802
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,690
Oh, yes, she bettah durag!

Now, I have had it with
these mother-tuckin' snakes

806
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,671
on this mother-tuckin' train.

807
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,375
So, baby, I'm slithering
down this runway,

808
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,378
giving them life
in my snakeskin train.

809
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,347
I gave you a myth.

810
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,914
All you see is the eyes,

811
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:01,949
and she's still penetrating
your soul with just the eyes.

812
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,150
And it's hot!

813
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:06,153
If that wasn't enough, bitch...

814
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,422
She's shedding, America.
She's shedding, darling.

815
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,490
Bitch, I'm living.

816
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,616
Give us that venom, baby.

817
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:17,498
Next stop, Syracuse,
Schenectady, Utica.

818
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:18,966
Does the carpet
match the drapes?

819
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,905
I am wearing
a Carol Burnett-inspired piece

820
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,475
from her iconic
Gone With the Wind sketch.

821
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:31,078
I am feeling so comedic,
so silly,

822
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,714
and I'm just feeling great
in these drapes.

823
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,949
The shade!

824
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,853
Rosé.

825
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,855
Well,
she's acting very aloof-ah.

826
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,059
Miss Rosé loves the eighties,

827
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,963
and tonight
I am Lady Tuxedo down.

828
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:53,834
Enormous amounts of tulle
cascading down my back.

829
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,070
My Mohawk even has a train.

830
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,473
That's how dedicated I am to
this fucking craft, okay, baby?

831
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,608
Ladies and gentlemen,

832
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,576

Ooh!

835
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:08,417
Hold on, I think
we're about to get blown.

836
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,817
Ooh, yay!

837
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:14,655

trans train artistry.

838

Chiffon behind me,

839
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,494
and I have a fully bedazzled
leaf blower to go with it.

840
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,396
I brought my own wind, girl.

841
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,599
She is the wind
beneath her own damn wings.

842
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,170
Tina Burner.

843
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:31,472
You know, this was
once worn by Trainy Kazan.

844
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,775
I am serving you

845
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,577
the conductor
of this train, henny,

846
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:39,647

Let those bitches
be the caboose,

848
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,818
because this motherfucker is
running the train up in here.

849
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:46,787
Tina! Bring me the track!

850
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:52,226
Joey Jay from the KGB.

851
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,462
Oh, she took the S&M train.

852
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,496
- Mm.
- Ooh!

853
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,697
I wanted to go

854
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,333
a Joey Jay
wacky direction with this.

855
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,235
A pussy-eating tongue,

856
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,071
hand-painted, hand-sewn
by yours truly.

857
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,273
Bitch, eat it.

858
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,542
Finally a look with taste.

859
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,545
Kandy Muse.

860
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,347
I think she's wearing
her training bra.

861
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,815
Oh.

862
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,353
Blood red
velvet leather fantasy,

863
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,956
looking like
a vamptress herself.

864
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:25,659
And when I turn the corner,
poof, slow the train.

865
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,695
I look so sexy. Mm!

866
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,364
This dress is the train event.

867
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,233
Tamisha Iman.

868
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,601
This the Diana Ross train.

869
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:35,136
Yes.

870
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,204
This is another one
of the Tamisha Iman creations.

871
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,240
Yeah, I made this one as well.

872
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,042
The train is flowing
like it's supposed to.

873
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,045
I'm confident in it,
and I don't care where you are,

874
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,547
you're gonna notice this pink
from across the room.

875
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:48,783
She got some juice
in that caboose.

876
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:49,884
Yes, she does.

877
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,353
Hey, Ru, is the train
still running?

878
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,423
Welcome, queens.

879
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:59,827
I'm proud to present
our programming slate for 2021.

880
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:04,398
Our first film
stars Denali, Olivia Lux,

881
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,468
Elliott, and Kahmora Hall.

882
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,570
This Valentine's Day,

883
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,105
get ready to fall in love

884
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:15,109
in the RuPaulmark original...

885
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,578
Misery is a successful
businesswoman

886
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,746
who hates Valentine's Day.

887
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,918
I hate Valentine's Day,
and I hate roses!

888
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:25,820
So when Misery Love inherits

889
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,489
the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm,

890
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:30,858
things get thorny.

891
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,728
What a dump.

892
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,464
Misery, is that you?

893
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,832
When I heard
you were gonna give me

894
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,968
the deed to the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm,

895
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,271
well, I mean
when I heard you were dying,

896
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,940
I dropped everything.

897
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,808
I would have dropped
a few pounds, too,

898
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:48,809
while you were at it.

899
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,444
Did I say that out loud?

900
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:55,082
I own 51% of this company.

901
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,484
Well, I would love
to give you the deed,

902
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,586
but the movie's just starting.

903
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,088
While the world is making love,

904
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,724
Misery is making trouble.

905
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,093
I'm going to burn
this rose farm to the ground

906
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,029
and build
a fudge packing factory

907
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,832
where a fudge packing factory
ought to be!

908
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,368
It's gonna take
a Valentine's Day miracle

909
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,972
to save the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm.

910
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,807
Misery wants
to close down the farm

911
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,443
and open
a fudge packing factory.

912
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,678
Just as I suspected!

913
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,480
If only there was some way

914
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,249
to get Misery to rediscover

915
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:31,285
the true meaning
of Valentine's Day.

916
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,220
Well, ain't that what
your bow and arrow is for?

917
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,524
Child, how do you even
get outta bed in the morning?

918
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:37,525
I don't know.

919
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,560
Sometimes it takes an old flame

920
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,095
to melt a cold heart.

921
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,163
Ash?

922
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,764
Cupid's arrow, hit your mark.

923
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:47,334
Make this big old ash tree talk!

924
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,703
I've been tree-incarnated!

925
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:54,208
Misery, why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

926
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:56,110
I was rooting for us.

927
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:59,847
The love between a girl
and a tree, it was forbidden.

928
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:00,981
You were a coward.

929
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,384
How dare you!

930
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:04,585
Oh!

931
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,221
My bark is worse than your bite!

932
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:09,223
Oh!

933
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:11,826
I've always been here,
pining for you.

934
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,095
Don't get sappy with me, Ash.

935
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,463
Misery Love's Company

936
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,366
will make you believe
in love all over again.

937
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,968
I'm in love with Ash Tree,

938
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,170
and I don't care
if the whole world knows it!

939
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,405
Does this mean

940
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,407
you're not going to burn down

941
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:29,476
the Love Family
Valentine's Day rose farm?

942
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,011
The rose farm
belongs to you now.

943
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,181
Well, I have a surprise, too.

944
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,950
I'm not really dying. Yeah!

945
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,319
Yeah! Hey!

946
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:41,388
But wait. It wouldn't be
a RuPaulmark holiday movie

947
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,958
without one more
ridiculous twist.

948
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,159
Brrrrrr!

949
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,827
I guess I should have told you.

950
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,295
I'm really a prince.

951
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,597
The only thing
I love more than trees

952
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,198
is a hot, rich prince.

953
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,767
Stop. You're giving me a woody.

954
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,607
Even though we gave away
the whole damn plot,

955
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:04,445
watch Misery Love's Company,
only on the RuPaulmark Channel.

956
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,616
Oh, my God.

957
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,889
Our next film stars Symone,
LaLa Ri, Utica, and Rosé.

958
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,391
This Flag Day,

959
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,794
get ready to fall in love
with yourself all over again

960
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,787
in the RuPaulmark original...

961
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:29,069
Meet Red Flag of the famous
flag-making Flag family.

962
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,306
I hate flags, and I hate myself.

963
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,042
When she receives
a desperate text,

964
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:38,746
Red rushes home to
the Flag family flag factory.

965
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,381
Red, thank goodness you're home.

966
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:44,351
The bank is foreclosing
on the Flag family flag factory.

967
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,854
I know you left town years ago,

968
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:49,189
but you still own
half of the flag factory.

969
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,658
Correction.

970
00:40:50,682 --> 00:40:53,160
I own 51% of the flag factory.

971
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,796
And the only reason I came back
is to shut it down.

972
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,598
As of midnight tonight,

973
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,367
I'll be tearing down
the flag factory,

974
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,202
and I'll be putting up
a wall factory

975
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,305
where a wall factory
ought to be!

976
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,473
Sometimes it takes an old flag

977
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,376
to show the children
how it's really done.

978
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,613
You can't make someone
love flags.

979
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,248
You've got to be born that way.

980
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:18,452
When I was younger,
I hid my true colors, too.

981
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,887
What helped you come out?

982
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,323
Picture it. Summer '69.

983
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:25,592
I came across
the most beautiful flag.

984
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:30,030
Well hung, and a nice pole, too.

985
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,565
Are we still talking
about flags?

986
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,801
With time running out,

987
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,171
can a magical lawn ornament
save Flag Day?

988
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,273
Must be walls!

989
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:41,608
Hello up there!

990
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,710
Do I know you?

991
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:46,204
I'm Gnomey.

992
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,583
The gnome.

993
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,819
Oh, Gnomey!

994
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:55,055
How long you had
your finger in that dike?

995
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,592
Anyway, this may sound
a little queer,

996
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,395
but I'm scared
to let my true colors show.

997
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,498
I'm just scared I won't fit in.

998
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:10,404
Bitch, you are perfect
just the way you are!

999
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,841
God Loves Flags
will make you laugh and cry

1000
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,542
and wonder if Flag Day

1001
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,112
is really some secret gay thing.

1002
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,980
Something's different about you.

1003
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,549
I will not be shutting down
the flag factory.

1004
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:26,954
And I'm ready
to let my freak flag fly!

1005
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,589
It's a coming-out present!

1006
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:30,324
I love it!

1007
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:31,625
I wish every day were Flag Day!

1008
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,396
You've already figured out
how it ends,

1009
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,797
but we'll tell you anyway.

1010
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:39,666
Here, pull my finger!

1011
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,838
Wait a minute. You a prince?

1012
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,941
You loving yourself
freed me, too.

1013
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,944
Red, will you marry me?

1014
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:54,948
I mean, you hot and all,
but I'm into women, so...

1015
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,817
Yes!

1016
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:03,023
Watch God Loves Flags
only on the RuPaulmark Channel,

1017
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,958
where the holidays
aren't just gay,

1018
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:07,194
they're super gay.

1019
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:15,235
Our final film stars Gottmik,
Tina Burner,

1020
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:20,107
Joey Jay, Kandy Muse,
and Tamisha Iman.

1021
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:22,810
Coming April 1st,
the joke's on you

1022
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,502
if you don't fall in love in...

1023
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,048
Meet April Fool.

1024
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:30,918
She hates April Fool's Day.

1025
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:35,088
I hate April Fool's Day,
and I hate pranks.

1026
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:39,092
The former small-town prankster
is now a cutthroat lawyer

1027
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,428
for the Humorless
Ice Cream company.

1028
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,365
April, we're just
one building away

1029
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,335
from putting up
a Humorless Ice Cream factory

1030
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,906
where a Humorless
Ice Cream factory ought to be.

1031
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,210
Who are the suckers
you want me to 86, boss?

1032
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:59,513
The Fools Rush In novelty
shoppe.
Heard of it?

1033
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:01,482
Yes, I have.

1034
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,217
But I'm an ambitious lawyer,

1035
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,852
and I have no trouble

1036
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:09,089
destroying my family's
novelty gift shoppe.

1037
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,024
And I'm not joking, bitch!

1038
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:16,897
You have till April 1st
to get me the deed.

1039
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:20,734
Is the plot of this movie
perfectly clear to you?

1040
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,237
This fool's errand
soon puts April

1041
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:26,907
between a rock
and a hardy-har place.

1042
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,743
April, you're home.

1043
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:30,878
Put it here!

1044
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,380
Unh! Aah-aah-aah!

1045
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:37,451
Gotcha! You looked like
you could use a good laugh.

1046
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:40,954
I'm here because I have
some papers for you to sign.

1047
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,557
Nothing to worry about.

1048
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:45,492
Now, where
is my Whoopie Cushion?

1049
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:50,764
Hey! Did someone
say my name? Aah!

1050
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,667
Oh, Whoopie,
my favorite employee,

1051
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,570
meet my ambitious granddaughter.

1052
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,605
You look like
you could use a laugh.

1053
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,508
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

1054
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,011
When was the last time someone
tickled your funny bone?

1055
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,405
If you know what I'm saying, oh!

1056
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,484
Ah-whoo! Ah-whoo!

1057
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,287
Come on, bitch! Whoo!

1058
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:15,556
With hours
until April Fool's Day,

1059
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,192
can a cheap Cher impersonation
change April's fortune?

1060
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,495
Whoa!

1061
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:24,531
Hey, April, why so dark, lady?

1062
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,368
Am I doing the right thing
by stealing my granny's shoppe?

1063
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,171
After the apocalypse,
three things remain.

1064
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,308
Laughter, love...

1065
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:35,309
and Cher.

1066
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,443
Whoa!

1067
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:40,247
So don't be a bitch, bitch.

1068
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:42,816
April's Fool's Paradise
will make you cry,

1069
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,418
drunk-text your ex,

1070
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:46,687
and wonder,
"Did I miss something?"

1071
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,323
Happy April Fool's Day,
everyone!

1072
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,692
April, where's the deed?

1073
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,394
There is no deed. Take this!

1074
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,363
Oh!

1075
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,732
It's too late.
I signed the deed.

1076
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,301
Joke's on you, April.

1077
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,437
You're fired!

1078
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:06,506
I've ruined everything!

1079
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,941
April Fools!

1080
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:11,812
Sasha signed the deed
with disappearing ink!

1081
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:13,480
Gotcha!

1082
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:15,949
Wait a minute.

1083
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,184
The movie's almost over,

1084
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,152
and April hasn't found
her secret prince.

1085
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,788
I have just
one more wish to make.

1086
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,081
Don't tell me.
You wish you had a prince.

1087
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,728
Oh, are you a real prince?

1088
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:30,330
Well, I'm a Prince impersonator.

1089
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,099
Let's go crazy!

1090
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,701
Gotcha! Whoa!

1091
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,070
Don't miss April Fools Rush In,

1092
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:39,640
coming to the RuPaulmark
Channel this Halloween.

1093
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:40,941
Ho! Ho-ho! Ho!

1094
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:44,111
April Fools!

1095
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,915
Brava, ladies, brava.

1096
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,518
I smell a Cable ACE award
in your future.

1097
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:57,314
Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

1098
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,085
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1099
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,898
Elliott With 2 Ts.

1100
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,900
Olivia Lux.

1101
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:07,768
Utica.

1102
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:08,792
Joey Jay.

1103
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,595
Gottmik.

1104
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,807
Tinta Burta.

1105
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,843
Tamisha Iman. Whoa!

1106
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,348
Ladies, you are...

1107
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:22,473
safe.

1108
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:24,851
Thank you.

1109
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,286
Some really great work
this week.

1110
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,288
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1111
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,480
You may leave the stage.

1112
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:38,999
Queens, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1113
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,826
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1114
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:46,139
Starting with Denali.

1115
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,275
- I love your train look.
- Thank you, Ross.

1116
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:51,344
This has a lot of whimsy,
but it's also beautiful.

1117
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,813
You just look like
a beautiful bird.

1118
00:47:52,837 --> 00:47:56,349
Your performance,
you have an opening line

1119
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:58,785
that is a legendary
Bette Davis line,

1120
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,387
which is, "What a dump!"

1121
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,688
Right.

1122
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,956
And I didn't get that.

1123
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,092
I think you could have
gone way further with it.

1124
00:48:05,116 --> 00:48:07,828
When you choose the big part,
the main character,

1125
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:09,796
you've got a lot of work
to do through every scene.

1126
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,599
- But it was a struggle.
- Okay.

1127
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:15,736
You have to find a way to make
the character interesting.

1128
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,071
Some of these other girls
managed to do that.

1129
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,907
All right, Kahmora Hall.

1130
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:25,112
This outfit, you embraced your
culture and you look fabulous.

1131
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:30,217
Your performance, however,
was a little... flat.

1132
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:33,253
Why did you leaf me
all these years ago?

1133
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,422
I wanted you to be ridiculous,
I wanted you to let go.

1134
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:36,623
You gotta take it
and run with it,

1135
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,658
like you do with your fashion.

1136
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,327
You're so buttoned up,

1137
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:42,262
and I feel like
you struggle with that.

1138
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,389
But art is about
not being afraid.

1139
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,203
Kahmora, what's going on?

1140
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,938
You're right.

1141
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,874
Like, I try to be perfect
all the time,

1142
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:57,210
and even just, like,
watching the video,

1143
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,345
I can see in my mind

1144
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,480
that I'm, like,
thinking too much about it

1145
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:01,815
and afraid to let go.

1146
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,216
I don't know why I'm struggling

1147
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,218
with, like,
feeling confident inside,

1148
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,355
but not showing it
on the outside to you all.

1149
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,490
Well, it's amazing that
you've been given the gift

1150
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:14,294
to see where
the mistake was in that.

1151
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,129
Thank you.

1152
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,699
All right.
From Arkansas, Symone.

1153
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:20,801
This has never been done
on the runway,

1154
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:24,805
using a freaking durag
as a train?

1155
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,174
Get into it.

1156
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,643
You are the Soul Train,
I tell you.

1157
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,378
Yes, ma'am.

1158
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,481
You have been able
to take the genius

1159
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,249
of embracing your culture.

1160
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,652
This is what America is about.

1161
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,453
Let's talk about the challenge.

1162
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,223
You came out ready to go.

1163
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:44,658
You had your lines,
you had the character.

1164
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:47,828
You got
the Julia Sugarbaker role.

1165
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:50,463
What I loved was that
you infused it with you.

1166
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,301
Even the way you just
said words so stupidly.

1167
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,170
- Flag fact'ry."
- "Fact'ry."

1168
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,606
So wrong it's right.

1169
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,241
Thank you.

1170
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:05,612
Up next, LaLa Ri.
Oh, my goodness, this outfit.

1171
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:09,115
Mm-mm, I could use that
for Sunday brunch for real.

1172
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,419
I wanna talk about
your performance.

1173
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,354
You came in kind of quiet,

1174
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,923
almost like you weren't
sure of yourself.

1175
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,592
You were out of your
comfort zone, am I right?

1176
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,060
Yeah, you're correct.

1177
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:22,662
It showed on your face, and I
think you kind of went within.

1178
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,464
And I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice.

1179
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,533
When I was doing Soul Plane,

1180
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:29,769
Mo'Nique knew
it was my first time doing it,

1181
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,240
and she said, "Make sure that
whatever you did to get here,

1182
00:50:33,264 --> 00:50:34,608
you keep doing it."

1183
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,376
Thank you.

1184
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,211
Up next, Rosé.

1185
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,380
Tonight on the runway,
this is fun.

1186
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,415
It's not my favorite to me,

1187
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,450
because I feel like
I'm looking at a suit

1188
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,318
with just an attachment on it.

1189
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,520
This is good. I just wanted
more, more, more.

1190
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,389
But Gnomey was super fun.

1191
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,491
Gnomey!

1192
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:53,293
The gnome.

1193
00:50:53,317 --> 00:50:54,594
Talk about weird.

1194
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,363
I mean, you're on your knees,
shooting as a gnome.

1195
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,131
I loved your characterization.

1196
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,333
You were so easy to direct.

1197
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:01,835
I didn't know you had
all that acting skill in you.

1198
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:04,504
Even though
you were just static,

1199
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,475
you were still able to bring
life into your character.

1200
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:09,943
And I can't wait
to see more of you.

1201
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:11,611
Thank you so much.

1202
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,480
Up next, Kandy Muse.

1203
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:14,681
Tonight on the runway,

1204
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,516
your train look doesn't
really say train for me.

1205
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,387
I think my issue with it, Kandy,
is it's a little too plain.

1206
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,521
- Okay.
- On the side,

1207
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:23,590
I don't wanna see your cincher

1208
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,525
or your undergarments
sticking out

1209
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,826
I know. I was gonna
pull it down,

1210
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,396
but my little beef tenderonis
were gonna come out,

1211
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,231
and I was trying
to keep it family friendly.

1212
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:36,836
Now, you were ridiculous
as Whoopie Cushion.

1213
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,471
Whoo! Whoo!

1214
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,040
You were committed
to the character,

1215
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:41,942
it was colorful, it was you.

1216
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:43,743
Your performance
is a perfect example

1217
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,814
of how if you just give in
to the moment and get loose,

1218
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,749
you can really strike gold.

1219
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,953
Laugh out loud funny,
Kandy Muse.

1220
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:54,378
Very well did.

1221
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:58,158
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1222
00:51:58,182 --> 00:52:00,727
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

1223
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,920
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1224
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:08,234
All right, now just
between us flag hags,

1225
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,436
whaddaya think?

1226
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,971
Denali.

1227
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:13,440
Denali is so good,
but I think she just bit off

1228
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,176
a bit more than
she could chew this week.

1229
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,512
Also, she didn't have
the gay cultural references

1230
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,214
that you kind of have to have
to know those lines.

1231
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:22,282
Yeah.

1232
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,251
I mean, that was, like, come on.

1233
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,486
Kahmora Hall.

1234
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,455
Ladies, it was tough
directing her.

1235
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,257
I mean, I literally
pulled that out of her.

1236
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,625
I was exhausted.

1237
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,427
I needed a coffee,
I needed a shot,

1238
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,296
I needed a deep-tissue massage.

1239
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,665
And that's what we got.

1240
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:39,966
I think she broke tonight.

1241
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,169
I think that that means
there's room for improvement.

1242
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,373
She doesn't feel safe enough
to just trust herself.

1243
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,041
This girl knows fashion,

1244
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:51,044
but tonight, that acting
challenge was pretty tough.

1245
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,079
- Symone.
- She had an idea

1246
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,881
of what she wanted to do
in this acting challenge,

1247
00:52:54,905 --> 00:52:56,883
and she executed it perfectly.

1248
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:57,984
I love it!

1249
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,586
Symone is a perfect example

1250
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,254
of someone
who trusts their instinct,

1251
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,423
who's done her homework

1252
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:06,926
and knows that she's gonna bring
Symone to every challenge.

1253
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,495
Symone is my cousin.

1254
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:13,333
That's Detroit all day.
Blow it out.

1255
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,801
We take fashion risks.

1256
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:17,771
Do not be surprised
if you see Rihanna

1257
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,774
with this long train durag,
all right?

1258
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,142
Because it's gonna happen,
people.

1259
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:24,010
LaLa Ri.

1260
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,779
She was the weakest
of the group.

1261
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,681
But with that said,
she still was not terrible.

1262
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,983
She wasn't popping.

1263
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,552
And if she's fading
in the background this early,

1264
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:33,653
that worries me.

1265
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,656
She is too good to fade.

1266
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,358
Rosé.

1267
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,692
I loved her performance.

1268
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,162
Her performance was A1.
It was funny.

1269
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,596
She was so wonderful.

1270
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,732
I loved all her little bits
that she did.

1271
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,267
She was ready
for that challenge,

1272
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:49,335
and she is ready
for this competition.

1273
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,470
Watch out for her.

1274
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,872
Kandy Muse.

1275
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,741
She knows how to bring comedy.

1276
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,976
She knows how to bring life.

1277
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,278
She infused herself in it,

1278
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:00,847
and that's how you excel
in these acting challenges.

1279
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,716
However, tonight on the runway,

1280
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,985
it was just messy for me.

1281
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:08,288
Yeah, the outfit
needed some adjustments.

1282
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,356
But she is just hilarious.

1283
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,059
Let's just give her some pins
to hide her undergarments.

1284
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:18,322
Silence. I've made my decision.

1285
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,359
Aah!

1286
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,462
Okay.

1287
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,841
Welcome back, ladies.

1288
00:54:27,865 --> 00:54:29,466
I've made some decisions.

1289
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:36,116
Rosé. As Gnomey the Gnome,

1290
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,842
you had us wrapped
around your pointer finger.

1291
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,590
You're safe.

1292
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,815
Thank you so much.

1293
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,963
Symone.

1294
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,723
Tonight you put
the "drag" in "durag."

1295
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,301
Con-drag-ulations.

1296
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,403
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

1297
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,373
Thank you.

1298
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,742
You've won a cash prize
of $5.000.

1299
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,544
All right.

1300
00:55:04,568 --> 00:55:06,012
I just got win number two.

1301
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:09,573
I feel on top of the world.

1302
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,921
Kandy Muse.

1303
00:55:14,945 --> 00:55:16,189
You are safe.

1304
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,290
Thank you, girl! Bye!

1305
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,530
LaLa Ri. Your runway look

1306
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:25,365
earned you high marks,

1307
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:30,027
but your rainbow flag
was flying at half mast.

1308
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:33,497
You're safe.

1309
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,777
Thank you.

1310
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:42,849
That means Denali, Kahmora Hall,

1311
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:46,219
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1312
00:55:46,243 --> 00:55:48,121
I was all the way at the top

1313
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:50,223
and now all the way
at the bottom?

1314
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:51,524
Seriously?

1315
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,294
Two queens stand before me.

1316
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:58,798
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1317
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:01,868
and save yourself
from elimination.

1318
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:06,239
The time has come...

1319
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:09,976
for you to lip sync...

1320
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,437
for your life!

1321
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,951
I know have to kill
this lip sync,

1322
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:20,420
not only to fight for my
position in this competition,

1323
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:22,388
but to prove to these girls

1324
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:25,058
that have never seen me
in my element

1325
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,593
that I'm an actual threat,

1326
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:29,829
and that if any of them
go against me, its over.

1327
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:35,068
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

- Thank you.
- Shantay you stay.

1368
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,434
That was so much fun to watch.

1369
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,261
I pity the fool
that has to go up against you.

1370
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:54,440
You may join the other girls.

1371
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:55,966
Thank you.

1372
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:03,583
Kahmora Hall.

1373
00:59:03,607 --> 00:59:05,785
Now, while you
are leaving us too soon,

1374
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:12,158
you will always be a part
of the Drag Race family tree.

1375
00:59:12,182 --> 00:59:16,129
Now sashay away.

1376
00:59:16,153 --> 00:59:18,064
Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

1377
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,298
Thank you all.

1378
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,734
Kahmora!

1379
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:28,532
From the House of Hall!

1380
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,680
I am going through,
like, a mix of emotions.

1381
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:38,317
I faced a lot of my inner demons
during the competition.

1382
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:40,486
In the end, I let my nerves
get the best of me.

1383
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,289
At the same time, I'm so
grateful for the opportunity.

1384
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,591
I've done things
I never thought I could do.

1385
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:46,793
My biggest lesson learned

1386
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,262
is that I need
to believe in myself.

1387
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:50,663
If you follow your dreams
and passions,

1388
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,689
everything will fall into place.

1389
00:59:57,127 --> 00:59:59,172
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1390
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:02,508
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1391
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,377
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1392
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:05,945
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1393
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,814
- Amen!
- Amen!

1394
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,158
All right,
now let the music play.

1395
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:10,707

Next time
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

1400
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,954
We're throwing a bag ball.

1401
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,535
Do you think you have
this one in the bag?

1402
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:30,919
Of course,
I don't know how to sew.

1403
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:32,939
Okay.

1404
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,575
This is frightening,
and I'm entertained.

1405
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,909
It was just stunning.

1406
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:40,046
I can tell by looking at this
you're not the sewer.

1407
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,448
I thought Elliott should
have been in the bottom.

1408
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,050
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1409
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,885
If y'all feel
that that is shade,

1410
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,119
then that's on y'all.

1411
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:48,863
No, I gotta bring you down
a little bit now.
