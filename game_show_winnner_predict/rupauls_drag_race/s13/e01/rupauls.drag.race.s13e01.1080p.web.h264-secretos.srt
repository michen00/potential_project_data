1
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:05,782
RuPaul: It's a new year

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,718
and a new season

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:12,555
with all new surprises.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:15,491
[RuPaul laughs]

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,027
Girl!

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,495
[laughs]

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,932
From the hood to Hollywood.

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,501
I'm Kandy Muse,
and I'm a Dominican doll

9
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,537
from New York City. Meow.

10
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,339
My drag style is kind of like

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,809
if you took a sex doll
and threw her in the Bronx,

12
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,077
that is literally me.

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:38,948
My most impressive drag talent
is my mouth. [pop]

14
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,284
I'm a good lip syncer.
I'm a loud-ass bitch.

15
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,452
You know, everyone
can be a drag queen,

16
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:44,888
but not everyone's
gonna be a star.

17
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,122
I'm a star.

18
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,258
First one!

19
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:51,394
Oh, my God, bitch, Season 13.

20
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:54,497
Most people might recognize me
from the former Haus of Aja.

21
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,666
And when we dismembered
and broke up,

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,034
I was definitely a loudmouth,

23
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,702
and I would say things about Aja

24
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,405
that maybe
I should have kept to myself.

25
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,775
But I also think that
she was a little jealous of me.

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,745
Come on, Miss Anastasia
Beverly Hills.

27
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,613
I want a sponsorship,
thank you very much.

28
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,814
She used to always be, like,

29
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:13,516
"Well, you're not famous,
so tone it down."

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,519
But now I'm here.

31
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,221
Well, no, I'm here.

32
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,256
[laughs]

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,457
That's so shady.

34
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,760
First one. Seems correct.

35
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:26,429
I'm here to prove that I am more

36
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,565
than just Kandy Muse
from the Haus of Aja.

37
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,168
I can stand as an entertainer
by my damn self.

38
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,437
I look fucking stunning.

39
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,106
Being the first bitch
to walk in the competition

40
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,875
after waiting years
to get on Drag Race

41
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,311
is such a fucking dream.

42
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,046
I am so excited to be here.

43
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,147
Come on, now!

44
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,115
And now, any bitch
that walks in after me,

45
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,775
second place. [laughs]

46
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,250
- Ooh.
- Filler queen.

47
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,055
"Filler queen?"

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,667
My name is Joey Jay,

49
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,236
and I'm the dumbest bitch
you'll ever meet.

50
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,907
She's wacky, she's crazy,
she's an adrenaline rush.

51
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,277
I can perform the house down,
boots back, bareback.

52
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,971
To be here, it is
a dream come true, so...

53
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,117
I lost my train of thought.

54
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,518
- Aah!
- Oh, what up, bitch?

55
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:23,987
Come on, Season 13. Good, girl.

56
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,255
- Hi, baby! Mwah, mwah.
- Hi, babe. Kandy.

57
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,458
Joey. Oh, my God,
I'm molting, girl.

58
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:33,896
Miss Thing is wearing
a chicken-feather coat.

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,964
Chicken feathers.

60
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,799
There are feathers
all over the floor.

61
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,167
Bawk bawk bawk bawk bawk.

62
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,970
Come on, chicken feathers.

63
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,506
Chicken feathers are
the least expensive feathers

64
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,575
that there are in the planet.

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,510
Girl, not even a marabou coat?

66
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,279
So wait. You do drag
full-time in your city?

67
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,148
No, I don't. I work
for a software company.

68
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,916
This is just
my little nighttime gig.

69
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,619
Oh, okay. Werk.
How many shows a week do you do?

70
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,855
- Just one.
- Just one?

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,490
Y'all think I'm a basic bitch.

72
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:01,624
You're not wrong.

73
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,693
I can't eat spicy foods,

74
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,194
I like Vanessa Carlton.

75
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,997
But don't underestimate
us Vanessa Carltons.

76
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,667
Really, bitch, I'm gonna
be in that top four.

77
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,168
Filler queen.

78
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,970
Plot twist.

79
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:16,005
This is my third time
auditioning.

80
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,106
Oh, this is my fourth.

81
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,875
Word. [alarm, thunder]

82
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,443
Ooh, girl.

83
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,780
She done already
done had herses.

84
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:25,681
Girl, what?

85
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,450
What?

86
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,252
There's only two of us?

87
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,788
- Aah!
- What is going on here?

88
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,023
Welcome, my queens.

89
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,161
What? You weren't expecting
to see me so soon?

90
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,295
No, ma'am.

91
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,564
Well, I hope you like surprises,

92
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,466
because I've got a big one,

93
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,501
and it's right around
the corner.

94
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,439
Racers, please report
to the main stage.

95
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,440
Ooh.

96
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,899
Like, now.

97
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,280
Girl.

98
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,849
God. I am so confused right now,

99
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:03,119
and I have no idea
what's about to go down.

100
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,754
Girl, I am poofed and gagged.

101
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,515
[RuPaul laughs]

102
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,434
♪ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ♪

103
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,604
♪ Head to toe,
let your whole body talk ♪

104
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,474
And what?

105
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:27,310
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race,

106
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:32,048
and we are serving Season 13

107
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,250
with some serious safety, honey.

108
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,720
Michelle Visage, what do you
think of the new judges' panel?

109
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,989
Baby, I feel like
I'm the head teller

110
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,091
at RuPaul's Savings and Loan.

111
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,593
Wanna make a deposit?

112
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,228
[all laugh]

113
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,631
The hilarious Ross Mathews.
Now, what do you think?

114
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,766
You know what, I love it,

115
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,801
and I even brought
my own squeegee.

116
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,103
Hi! Oh, Carson, hi!

117
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,406
Michelle!

118
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,775
And style superstar
Carson Kressley.

119
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,878
Are you ready to read some lips?

120
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:02,979
Which ones?

121
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,181
[laughs] Both sets.

122
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,682
[all laugh]

123
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:10,419
Tonight we're doing things
just a little differently.

124
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,455
For the first time
in Drag Race herstory,

125
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,457
we're kicking off the season

126
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,685
with six
lip syncs for your lives.

127
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,764
Now, some will shantay

128
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,767
and some will sashay away.

129
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,369
Wow.

130
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,372
Ooh, child,
you ain't ready for this.

131
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,374
[all laugh]

132
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,809
Racers, start your engines,

133
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,036
and may the best drag queen win.

134
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,852
What the fuck is going on?

135
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,954
Yo, I just walked into Drag Race

136
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,589
and now I'm standing
on the main stage

137
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,991
and I don't know
what is about the happen.

138
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,460
I can't even look at RuPaul
in the eyes,

139
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,728
because I'm getting so nervous.

140
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,865
I'm already feeling scared
as fuck and insecure,

141
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,333
but I signed up for this.

142
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,334
Get it together.

143
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,736
Welcome, ladies.
Surprised to see me?

144
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,708
You've made it to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race,

145
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,410
and so soon.

146
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,145
We'd like to take this moment

147
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,689
to get to know you
a little bit better.

148
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,585
Judges, say hello to Kandy Muse.

149
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,220
- Hi, Kandy.
- Hi, Kandy.

150
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,521
- Hello.
- I would love to know

151
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,159
what makes this
a signature Kandy Muse look.

152
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,527
It's sexy, it's slutty,
it's denim,

153
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,028
it's from Brooklyn,
it's New York.

154
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,364
I heard you're a member
of the Haus of Aja?

155
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,634
That's the former
Haus of Aja, but yes.

156
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:34,103
- [laughs]
- Well, what house now?

157
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,373
The dollhouse, with my drag sis
Dahlia Sin from Season 12.

158
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,908
Part of the broccoli bunch.

159
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,776
She is a broc-ally.

160
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,112
International
House of Pancakes here.

161
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:45,982
[all laugh]

162
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,818
Judges, say hello to Joey Jay.

163
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,720
Tell us about your look, Joey.

164
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,323
Well, I like chicken,
I like to cluck, I like a butt,

165
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,425
so I decided to dress up
as all three.

166
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,294
Cluck, cluck. [tongue pop]

167
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,496
[laughs]

168
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,431
What inspired you to do drag?

169
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,667
Self-expression,
and cluckin' and buckin'.

170
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,369
Thank you, Joey.

171
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,703
Thank you.

172
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:10,539
Ladies, your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

173
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,174
got you here.

174
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,177
Now let's see
what you can do with it.

175
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,139
Two queens stand before me.

176
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,751
Prior to tonight,

177
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,687
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

178
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,824
of Call Me Maybe
by Carly Rae Jepsen.

179
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,827
In a moment, I'll ask
one of you to shantay

180
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,064
and one of you to sashay away.

181

Bitch, excuse me?

182
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,334
We just walked into
the competition,

183
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,802
and now we have to
lip sync for our lives?

184
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,872
One of us is about to go home.
It ain't gonna be me.

185
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:48,311

first chance to impress me

320

Hey, Michelle.

321
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,795
So tell me about this look.

322
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,197
Well, I'm a professional
figure skater outside of drag,

323
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,765
so I love to mold
the two worlds.

couldn't get any gayer,

[RuPaul laughs]

327
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,373
But I have a serious question
for you, okay?

328
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,909
Are you more of a Tonya Harding
or a Nancy Kerrigan?

329
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,902
I'm definitely more of a Tonya,
if you know what I mean.

330
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,014
I know what you mean.

331

So tell us about what
does this look say to you.

341
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:52,801
Yes, LaLa Ri is very sexy,
but a little classy,

342
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,405
so this represents
the class and the sex.

343
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,740
And the ass.

344
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,742
- Of course.
- There you go.

345

LaLa, I wanted to ask you,

346
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,346
do you think you could beat
Denali in a lip sync?

347
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,916
Of course I think I can
beat Denali in a lip sync.

348
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,086
I mean, she's a lovely girl
and all, but bring it.

349

Well, we will see about that.

350

differently this season.

00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:26,902
I absolutely
am a lip sync assassin,

354
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,470
but not in ice skates.

355
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:32,508
Ladies, this is your
first chance to impress me

356
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:37,537
and save yourself
from getting the porkchop.

357
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,284

358
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,952

I didn't come here
to go home early.

I'm just gonna pray on it.

416
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,975

thank you or what?

00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,274
Okay, girl.

421
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,009
Well, shantay I stay,
thank you, girl.

422
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,047
Denali, I'm sorry, my dear,

423
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:28,774
but you're getting the porkchop.

424
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,511
Now sashay away.

425
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,785
Feeling icy, feeling spicy.

426
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,168
[exhales]

427
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,103
I'm unbelievably devastated.

428
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,638
I'm just kind of,
like, oh, my God,

429
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,099
I'm going home without
showing anything on Drag Race.

430
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:00,148
What the fuck is up on here?

431
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,450
- I'm Denali.
- I'm Joey.

432
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,118
- Nice to meet you.
- A pleasure.

433
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,586
I'm, like, I don't understand.

434
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,356
Was I not the only one
eliminated?

435
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,391
Oh, no, look it.

436
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,126
They're all the first girl outs.

437
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,963
I see on the wall
the porkchop loading dock,

438
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,331
and all of these pictures

439
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,433
of first-eliminated queens
from Drag Race.

440
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,501
Oh, no.

441
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,037
Porkchop herself, Shangela,

442
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,805
Miss Vanjie, Dahlia Sin.

443
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,541
There's some sort of trickery.
I don't know what's going on.

444
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,934
I feel like something's
gonna jump out of a box.

445
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,513
So here we are,
trying to figure out

446
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,416
what the fuck
has just happened to us.

447
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,884
Are we being sent home?

448
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,320
Am I about to de-drag
at the airport?

449
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,513
Can I call my mom?

450
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,337
Don't let the smooth taste
fool you, baby. [laughs]

451
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,639
My name is Symone,
I am 25 years old,

452
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:01,476
and I am the ebony enchantress.

453
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,978
Queen number one, all right.

454
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,479
Let's do it.

455
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,350
My drag is very real woman,
very female illusional.

456
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,619
This is gonna be my spot,
front and center, honey.

457
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,422
I love strong women
who've been through things,

458
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,923
and if you Black,
that's even better.

459
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,659
I'm here, bitch! [laughs]

460
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,295
Symone is the confidence,
the essence.

461
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,222
She is a goddess,
she's everything.

462
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,440
Holler at me.
I know you know me.

463
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,742
Holler at me.
I know you know me.

464
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,277
Tamisha is here.

465
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,045
I am Tamisha Iman,

466
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:40,482
one of the baddest in the art
form of female impersonation.

467
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,918
I am sassy, I am lovable,

468
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:47,289
but at the same time,
I can be W-I-T-C-H if need be.

469
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,257
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

470
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,425
Nice to meet you. I'm Tamisha.

471
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,593
It's lovely to meet you, too.
I'm Symone.

472
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,228
- It's nice to meet you, Symone.
- Thank you.

473
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,296
I love the power shoulder.

474
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,630
Thank you, I'm into fashion.

475
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,399
There we go. Pageant gal?

476
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,867
- Of course.
- Of course.

477
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,001
Yes. Of course.

478
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,503
And the matriarch
of the Iman family.

479
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,504
Word!

480
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:04,272
I'm the mother of the dynasty.

481
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,007
- Come on, dynasty.
- Yeah, it's a dynasty.

482
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,578
Miss Tamisha is very...

483
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,713
Now, no shade, no shade.

484
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,115
Like a mother figure.

485
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,182
But also, like, you know

486
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,919
that she is here
to play and slay.

487
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:18,987
[alarm, thunder]

488
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,822
RuPaul: Ooh, girl.

489
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:24,650
She done already
done had herses.

490
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,229
What the hell?

491
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,831
Maybe they hit
the button too soon.

492
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,199
Just two of us?

493
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,935
We ain't even done nothin' yet.
We just walked in.

494
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,805
Well, hello, my queens.

495
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,775
I wanna see both of you
on the main stage.

496
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,934
Hit it!

497
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:44,880
What the hell?

498
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,748
Come to the floor?

499
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,883
You supposed
to come in the room.

500
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,427
We don't supposed
to come to the floor.

501
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,360
Welcome, queens.
Surprised to see me?

502
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,028
Now it's time

503
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,822
to make a positive first
impression on the judges...

504
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,903
starting with Symone.

505
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:11,173
So I see you've got little mini
Polaroids as your dress.

506
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,340
Oh, yes.

507
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:14,242
Are they pictures of you?

508
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,510
Each one of them
are pictures of me,

509
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,179
a little couple faces,
a couple of shoes,

510
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:18,914
a couple of asses pictures, too.

511
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,382
[all laugh]

512
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,983
So does that tell me
that you love yourself?

513
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,952
Yes, I do love myself.

514
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,554
- Good.
- I love my drag persona.

515
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:26,621
- Great.
- It saved my life.

516
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:27,756
Where did you grow up?

517
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,791
I grew up in Conway, Arkansas.

518
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,260
I dated a guy
from Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

519
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,562
Oh!

520
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:34,930
Is he your grandfather?

521
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,898
[all laugh] I think so.

522
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:38,867
I knew he said something
about a cross-dresser.

523
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,136
[all laugh]

524
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,938
So we might be related.

525
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,508
[all laugh]

526
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,176
All right, Tamisha Iman.

527
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,512
I see that you have found
what I have lost.

528
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,580
- Oh!
- Yep.

529
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:52,681
I did get 'em.

530
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,516
Yeah, you sure did.
You got 'em, girl.

531
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,751
How long have you
been doing drag?

532
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,752
30 years.

533
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,187
What?

534
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,889
- Yeah, 30 years.
- Wow.

535
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,991
Do you think
your vast experience

536
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:04,159
is going to be helpful

537
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,094
or be a hindrance
in the competition?

538
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,664
Well, I'm not as great
as I used to be,

539
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,167
but I'm still
as good as I should be.

540
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,203
I'm recently
getting over cancer.

541
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,173
Because you were cast
on Season 12.

542
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,708
Yes. On that Friday,

543
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,944
I got the call to say,
"Hey, you made it!"

544
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:26,248
On that Sunday, I got
the call from my doctor

545
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,918
stating that I had
stage three colon cancer,

546
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:33,288
and they had to start
immediately radiation and chemo.

547
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,724
So it devastated me.

548
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,760
You know, I got so bad
to where I couldn't walk.

549
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,830
The cancer and the radiation
took such a control over me.

550
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:45,433
And knowing that
I could possibly fight

551
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:49,170
to get back here just
one more time, I fought it.

552
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,272
So within a year, I'm...

553
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,573
I'm a conqueror,

554
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,209
and I'm so thankful
that you gave me this chance.

555
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,511
So I'm blessed.
Whatever happens, I'm blessed.

556
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,812
- All right.
- God is good.

557
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,547
Thank you, Tamisha.

558
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,184
Ladies, I have
just one more thing to say.

559
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,186
Oh.

560
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,680

561
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:12,227
H-h-h-huh?

562
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,562
Ladies, this
is your first chance

563
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:22,561
to impress me and save yourself
from getting... the porkchop.

566

567
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,119
I ain't been here five minutes
and y'all doing all this.

568
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,587
This is crazy.

569

you think you know
until you get here,

611
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,662
and now you don't know nothing.

612
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,431
Let me take a deep breath,

613
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,757

what's about to happen.

00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,753
Sorry.

619
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,288
In the seven minutes
that we are here,

620
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,990
I have literally walked
through the werkroom,

621
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,526
went to the main stage,
and won a lip sync.

622
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,896
What is going on, America?

623
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,531
Whew.

624
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,934
Tamisha Iman,
I'm sorry, my dear,

625
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:44,530
but that means you're
getting the porkchop.

626
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,843
Now sashay away.

627
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:51,212
Thank you. I'm always
gonna be a Ru girl.

628
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:52,914
Thank you. Mwah!

Wow.

631
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,122
I'm totally destroyed, because
this is my second chance,

632
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,657
and it's over that fast.

633
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,449
Just that fast,
in the blink of a eye.

00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,664
- Hey, cutie.
- Well, well, well.

I'm Tamisha.

00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,237
I'm still in shock and awe.

639
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,438
They're excited.

640
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,473
"Hey, girl, how are you?"

641
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,141
I'm like, "Why are we here?"

642
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,777
We're here in a room
full of first eliminees.

643
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:24,145
Oh, are we? [laughs]

644

Our picture is gonna
go there for next season.

645
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:32,453
No, I don't feel like
it's the end, exactly.

646
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:33,922
It felt like the end to me.

647
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:37,525
I got eliminated on that stage,
and it hurt like...

648
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,527
Yeah, but you know
it's not RuPaul's Drag Race

649
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,628
without a twist.

650
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,463
Bitch, I don't know
what you feeling,

651
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,098
but at the end of the day,
the lady said go home.

652
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:45,867
The bags are packed,
we all in this room.

653
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:46,868
They just letting us
come together

654
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,836
so it'll be one van

655
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,171
to take us all to the airport.

656
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:51,306
You're very hopeful,

657
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,641
and I get it, but, you know...

658
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:58,246
I'm holding on because I am not
accepting elimination just yet.

659
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,347
This ain't no twist.

660
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,983
The twist is
we twisting to the door.

661
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,842
The lady said go home.

662
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,621
Time to crash the system.

663
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,257
I'm Gottmik,
and I'm ready to kill it.

664
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,174
My drag is inspired by fashion

665
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:30,545
and designers
like McQueen, Galliano.

666
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,214
Picasso's paintings
inspire me a lot.

667
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,650
I love putting shapes on my face

668
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:36,684
where they probably
shouldn't be.

669
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,087
She's just a campy, spooky,

670
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:41,823
clown artistry thing, I guess.

671
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,258
Not the first person here.

672
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,627
I cannot.

673
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:51,499
I'm so excited to be here
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

674
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,768
Thank you. Hold the applause.
[laughs]

675
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,937
I think I'll bring a different
angle to this competition.

676
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:59,741
I am a transgender man,

677
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,644
so born a girl,
transitioned to a guy,

678
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,646
dress like a girl for money.

679
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,181
Very that. [laughs]

680
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,374
But, I'm so psy...

681
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,554
No one saw that.

682
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:17,258
I am an extravagant
celebrity makeup artist.

683
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:19,027
I'm gonna have, like,
a buffalo bump on my hair.

684
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:23,731
I've painted Cindy Crawford,
Heidi Klum, Paris Hilton.

685
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,067
And so the biggest
misconception about me

686
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:27,802
is that I'm just
a makeup artist.

687
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,830
I'm so much more, and I cannot
wait to show these bitches.

688
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,847
Ah-choo!

689
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,773
She's sickening.

690
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,854
I am Utica Queen,
and I am from Utica, Minnesota.

691
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,956
See what I did there?

692
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,658
I'm the queen of the unexpected.

693
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,618
I am the wacky, inflatable,
waving-arms tube queen.

694
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,434
I'm always dishing a hot dish of
ridiculousness to an audience.

695
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,602
I'm so excited to spread smiles

696
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:04,305
to all the wonderful people
in the world.

697
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,506
Hello!

698
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,208
Hi, I'm Gottmik.
Nice to meet you.

699
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,310
A pleasure, Utica.

Hi, how are you? [laughs]

703
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,883
This is crazy!

704
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,218
So what type of drag is she?

705
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,219
What does she do?

706
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,620
So I'm really kooky.

707
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,389
Uh-huh.

708
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,324
It's kind of like if your
best friend's a supermodel.

709
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,459
Like, she walks into the room,

710
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,993
but then she trips
and falls on her face

711
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,262
and eats her own booger.

712
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,631
Uh, that's me. [both laugh]

713
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,300
[alarm, thunder] Oh, no.

714
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:33,534
RuPaul: Ooh, girl.

715
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,337
She done already
done had herses.

716
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:41,008
The alarms are going off,
the lighting is changing.

717
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,543
Oh, my God, I love
this lighting, though.

718
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,303
It's matching my outfit,
so I'm living for that.

719
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:48,316
Welcome, queens.

720
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,085
Meet me on the main stage,

721
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,378
because I wanna see you sweat.

722
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,225
I'm already sweating.

723
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,450
Aah! What's happening?

724
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,767
Welcome to the main stage.

725
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,034
- Whoo!
- Thank you!

726
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:08,603
Thank you for having us.

727
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:11,773
Now, listen, we just wanna
get to know you a little better.

728
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:16,077
So starting with Gottmik,
we're gonna talk to the judges.

729
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,278
Hey, Gottmik.

730
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:18,613
Hey, Ross. How are you?

731
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,448
How would you describe
your drag?

732
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,718
I like everything to be
kind of Pierrot inspired,

733
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,154
clown, black and white,

734
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,791
but with, like, a vibrant,
campy touch to it.

735
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,360
We can obviously see that
you are great with makeup,

736
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,795
and you've got
a great fashion sense.

737
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,062
Thank you.

738
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,923
Would you describe yourself
as a lip sync assassin?

739
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:43,738
I'm not a lip sync assassin,

740
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,573
but I can lip sync
the house down for sure.

741
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,208
Okay.

742
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,309
Thank you, Gottmik.

743
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,744
Thank you.

744
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,046
- Up next, Utica.
- Hi.

745
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,284
I wanna know how this outfit
describes who Utica is,

746
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,952
and why is there a strawberry
on your head?

747
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,453
So the strawberry,

748
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,490
I used to be allergic
to strawberries growing up,

749
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:06,561
and it's kind of a testament
to me getting through it.

750
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,764
[laughs] So... That's so crazy.

751
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,767
- It's so dumb. Whoo-oo.
- I love it. Okay, go on.

752
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,901
And, yeah, I would say my style

753
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,003
is if you took this pattern
and that pattern

754
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,471
and this pattern and this
pattern and put it in a jar,

755
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,709
and then shook it all up
and then there you go,

756
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,578
but with a touch of polish.

757
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:24,879
Just a touch.

758
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,180
Are you a little nervous?

759
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,849
Feel it in my nuggets.

760
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,417
- You feel what?
- I feel it in my nuggets.

761
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,652
Oh, okay. We all love nuggets.

762
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,521
[laughs]

763
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,913
Ladies, I have a question.

764
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:40,185
How well do you perform
under pressure?

765
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,165
Actually, you know what?
Don't answer that.

766
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,491
I think we're about to find out.

767
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,962
Two queens stand before me.

768
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:56,644
What? Right off the bat?

769
00:33:56,668 --> 00:34:00,348
Ladies, this is your
first chance to impress me

770
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:05,644
and save yourself
from getting the porkchop.

771
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,458
The time has come... [thunder]

772
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:12,927
for you to lip sync...

773
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,462
for...

774
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:17,431
your...

775
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:19,124
[echoing] ...life. Hah!

776
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,404
I'm cracking my knuckles
right now.

777
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,573
But, like, getting ready,
like, focused.

778
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:29,343
No one is sending me home
on the first episode.

779
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:33,748
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

780
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,807

[laughter and applause]

824
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,305
Ladies, I've made my decision.

825
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,576
Oh, what's gonna happen next?

826
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,613
This is crazy!

827
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:28,119
Ladies, I've made my decision.

828
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,128
Gottmik, shantay you stay.

829
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,141
Oh, my God, thank you.

830
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:43,878
I fucking just won a lip sync
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

831
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,946
Hello!

832
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,082
Utica, I'm sorry, my dear,

833
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,843
but that means
you're getting the porkchop.

834
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,624
Now sashay away.

835
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,826
Thank you very much
for this opportunity.

836
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,228
Oh! No!

837
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,397
It can't end this soon.

838
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,500
I'll get you for this, RuPaul!

839
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,992
[laughing]

840
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,815
Hey!

841
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,719
Oh, my God,
I am the first one here.

842
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,979
I could have gone
to the dentist.

843
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:33,194
My name is Rosé, and I reside
at the busy intersection

844
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,263
of Wit Avenue
and Fashion Boulevard.

845
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,365
Rosé is a comedy queen,

846
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,770
kind of like if Robin Williams
and Jim Carrey had a child.

847
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,473
What a horrible daughter for
the two of them to procreate.

848
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,408
[laughs]

849
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,111
Got a little stage
going on here.

850
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,613
I'm not gonna step on that.
It might collapse.

851
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,148
I had breakfast today.

852
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,083
I'm a singer and a dancer.

853
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,687
I was on The Voice
and America's Got Talent.

854
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,956
I'm very competitive.
I don't like to lose.

855
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,126
But I usually win. [laughs]

856
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,295
I should, uh, probably
wipe off this tooth,

857
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,831
since no one's gonna see it.

858
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,067
I'm basically doing shtick
for an empty house,

859
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:15,794
which is not something Rosé's
used to, I'm proud to say.

860
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,940
Lux be a lady tonight.

861
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:35,389
I'm Olivia Lux, and I like
to light up a room

862
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,192
whenever I walk into a space.

863
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:41,929
I consider Olivia Lux
as that diva,

864
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:45,199
but that, like,
really nice diva,

865
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:46,867
like Diana Ross
and the Supremes.

866
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,269
Oh, my God! [both laugh]

867
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,771
- You look so good.
- Mwah, mwah.

868
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,972
You look amazing.

869
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,174
It's so good to see you.

870
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,408
You, too, baby.
I think the last time

871
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:58,145
I saw you in drag
was literally Lady Liberty.

872
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,614
Yeah, where I was a contestant
and you were hosting it.

873
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,517
I look up to Rosé so much.

874
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,020
She's, like,
New York City drag royalty.

875
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:10,925
And now we're in America's
biggest drag pageant together.

876
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,093
Like, whaaa.

877
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,728
At that time,
I had been doing drag

878
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,064
for, like, what, six months?

879
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,732
Wait, how long
have you been doing drag?

880
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,767
Like, a year and a half.

881
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,403
A year and a half? Okay, girl.

882
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:25,372
I'm a little surprised to see
Olivia here, to be honest,

883
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,508
because I would expect Olivia

884
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:30,377
to take just a little bit longer
to be really ripe enough.

885
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,881
But her smile is stunning,

886
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,383
and I can't wait to knock
her teeth out one by one.

887
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,686
[laughs]

888
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,621
[alarm, thunder]

889
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,223
RuPaul: Ooh, girl.

890
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:45,125
She done already
done had herses.

891
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,795
Welcome, ladies. What?

892
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,030
Were you expecting more?

893
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,500
Good, because so am I.

894
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:57,271
Meet me on the main stage.

895
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,372
Ha!

896
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,530
Pronto!

897
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,376
Okay, the main stage.

898
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,778
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

899
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:09,073
Oh, it is about to start, honey.

900
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:15,823
Welcome, ladies.

901
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,325
Breathe deep and take in

902
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,662
the charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent

903
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:24,431
of the queens
that came before you.

904
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,767
The smell of hairspray
and desperation.

905
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,469
[both chuckle]

906
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,839
Now, the judges wanna get to
know you a little bit better,

907
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,407
starting with Rosé.

908
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,744
What does this outfit
tell us about you, Rosé?

909
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,079
RuPaul always says that
if you wanna make money,

910
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,347
you should wear a suit.

911
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,484
And I never understood that,
so I wore this instead.

912
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:44,985
[all laugh]

913
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,821
I think I recognize you
from New York.

914
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,457
Are you part
of the girl group with Jan?

915
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:52,126
Yes, I am. Stephanie's Child.

916
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,495
Are you planning on lasting
a little longer than Jan?

917
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,098
I am absolutely planning
on lasting longer than Jan.

918
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,099
- Ooh.
- Okay.

919
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,769
Up next, Olivia Lux.

920
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,237
Hi.

921
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:08,275
I would love to know what this
outfit says about Olivia Lux.

922
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:11,312
Well, I do love
a good Showgirl moment,

923
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,213
and I thought
I'd go with something

924
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,616
that reminded me
of a theater curtain.

925
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,185
And a large purse for all
those things you have in it.

926
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,553
Exactly.

927
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,189
I like to carry
my extra eyelashes in this.

928
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,390
[all laugh]

929
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:26,093
If I were to go see
an Olivia Lux show,

930
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,662
how would it be different
than any other drag queen show?

931
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:31,498
I really like to incorporate
live drag elements,

932
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:35,069
so you may see me sit down at
the piano for a bit, you know.

933
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:36,603
Well, I love a big organ.

934
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:39,206
[all laugh]

935
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,877
Ladies, we're doing things a
little differently this season.

936
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,203
It's all come down to this.

937
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,306
Two queens stand before me.

938
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:55,889
Ladies, this is your
first chance to impress me

939
00:41:55,913 --> 00:42:01,185
and save yourself
from getting the porkchop.

940
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:06,467
The time has come... [thunder]

941
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,535
for you to lip sync...

942
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,328
for your life.

943
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,209
For our life?

944
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:16,877
On day one?

945
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,278
And against Rosé?

946
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:24,284
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

to say that I am one
with the music,

you're getting the porkchop.

I have a reputation of being,
like, loud and outspoken.

I got a lot to say,
and I will not be silent.

did I just do, like, Showgirls?

The Mackie doll
is finally out of her box.

You can smell the privilege
off of her.

1028
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,409
And my drag is all about
the glitz and glam.

1029

never go out of style.

- Tina Burner.

the only one there right now,

she's one to watch out for.

whole Tina Burner experience

00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,779
Kahmora is shady, bitch.

1050
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:21,939
I'm, like, yes,
you can be on Team Burner.

1051
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,486
Oh!

00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,288

00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:36,863
White girls can't dance, huh?

1057
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,465
[both laugh]

1058
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,467
My name is Elliott with 2 Ts,

1059
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,269
and I'm the most famous
drag queen

1060
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,304
you ain't never heard of.
[laughs]

1061
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:48,408
My drag is very much
a housewife with a secret.

1062
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,577
I've been doing drag
since I was 15 years old,

1063
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,279
dancing, acting, singing.

1064
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:56,717
I didn't practice my autograph
since I was a baby for nothing.

1065
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:58,218
She looks fun.

1066
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,053
- [laughs]
- Sis.

1067
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,589
She got a windbreaker on
and some pants,

1068
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,724
and I'm just, like, sis,

1069
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:06,026
do you just go
power walking with my mom?

1070
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,060
- Hi!
- Hello, hello.

1071
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,029
Hi. I'm Kahmora.

1072
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,564
I'm Elliott with 2 Ts.

1073
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:11,698
- Hi, Elliott with 2 Ts.
- Hello.

1074
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,291
All I can think about is ET.

1075
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:18,138
Elliott...

1076
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:19,773
And I was, like, ooh, girl.

1077
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:21,341
She needs to phone home

1078
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,744
and get a new outfit
for the werkroom entrance, girl.

1079
00:48:23,768 --> 00:48:25,011
I've seen you before.

1080
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:28,448
You were at a drag brunch
in Las Vegas.

1081
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:30,417
I sure was.

1082
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:31,451
That's where I'm from.

1083
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,086
Is this look very Vegas
or something?

1084
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,422
I'm just curious
what your inspiration was.

1085
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:36,623
Here we go with the shade.

1086
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:37,791
That is not shade!

1087
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:39,760
Here you go. Watch out for her.

1088
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:41,795
[alarm, thunder]

1089
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,264
RuPaul: Ooh, girl.

1090
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,923
Is this really happening
right now?

1091
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:51,238
My queens, main stage, now.

1092
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:52,563
[laughs]

1093
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:56,367
Get to the main stage.
Is that what they said?

1094
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,247
I don't understand.
What's going on?

1095
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,440
Trying to raise my eyebrows,
but they don't raise right now.

1096
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,586
All that pumping.

1097
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,912
Wait, let me get my purse!

1098
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,750
Are they moving? [laughs]

1099
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,255
Welcome, ladies.
Surprised to see me?

1100
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,001
Say hello to the judges.

1101
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,203
- Hello, judges.
- Hi!

1102
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:24,905
They're dying to get to know

1103
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,464
a little bit more
about each of you.

1104
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,444
Starting with Tina Burner.

1105
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,613
Little bit of a New York legend
here with you.

1106
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,948
I'm glad to see you here.

1107
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,850
That just means I'm old.

1108
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,151
Well, join the club, sweetheart.

1109
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,387
You've got your whole
fire department thing going on.

1110
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,923
Does this speak to us
and tell us who you are?

1111
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:45,559
I'm, like, a campy,
comedy, sassy queen.

1112
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,160
So, like, Tina Burner,
turn it and burn it,

1113
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:48,261
burning down the house.

1114
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,730
And so, we're here
to put that fire out

1115
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,666
with my large hose.

1116
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,934
Yeah. [laughs]

1117
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,035
Sss.

1118
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,871
Is it true that
you were in a boy band

1119
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:59,639
when you were 19 years old?

1120
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,907
Yes, I was in a boy band.

1121
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,809
After three years,
I had to say Bye, Bye, Bye.

1122
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,844
[all laugh]

1123
00:50:03,868 --> 00:50:05,278
You guys are no longer N'Sync?

1124
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:09,382
No. No. We're more like the
Back Door Boys now, you know?

1125
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,218
Well, that's
a fascinating back story.

1126
00:50:11,242 --> 00:50:14,354
We got a lotta back
going on today.

1127
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,555
Back to you, Ru.

1128
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,592
[all laugh]

1129
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:20,060
- Up next, Elliott.
- Hi.

1130
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:22,529
You look like
a member of Exposé.

1131
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:23,530
Okay.

1132
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:24,998
Yes, I love that outfit.

1133
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,032
Thank you.

1134
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,601
What does it say about you?

1135
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,804
I love an eighties throwback,
I love a good structured moment.

1136
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:32,038
I grew up as a dancer,

1137
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,674
so the big dancing
female divas of the eighties

1138
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,842
really speak to me.

1139
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,511
What kind of dancing
did you grow up doing?

1140
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,213
Well, not to
Brooke Lynn Hytes myself,

1141
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,115
but I was a ballet dancer
my whole life,

1142
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,285
and I worked on cruise ships
for a while as a dancer.

1143
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:47,921
And what was your favorite
port of call?

1144
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,723
My favorite was Cozumel.

1145
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,258
You like to party, don't you?

1146
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,393
A little bit. Just a little bit.

1147
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,529
[all laugh]

1148
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:58,331
Last but not least,
Kahmora Hall.

1149
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,499
You know, I just watched

1150
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:00,834
Beyond the Valley of the Dolls
last night

1151
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,736
again for the eightieth time,

1152
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,040
and your hair is serving
Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.

1153
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,275
That was definitely
the inspiration.

1154
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,276
You look stunning.

1155
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:10,844
Thank you so much.

1156
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,713
I really love this look
that you have on.

1157
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,915
Who's the designer?

1158
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:17,450
It's an original Bob Mackie.

1159
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:18,919
I bought it
from an auction house,

1160
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,287
and I just had to have it.

1161
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,388
What?

1162
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,455
They had it reconstructed
to fit my body,

1163
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,190
because I'm sample size.

1164
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,926
- That is insane.
- Wow.

1165
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,093
I love it.

1166
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,161
Kahmora Hall, any relation

1167
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,964
to our queen Jaida Essence Hall?

1168
00:51:30,988 --> 00:51:33,300
Jaida Essence Hall
is my big sister.

1169
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,567
The House of Hall.

1170
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,970
We're known for great shoulders
and great clavicles.

1171
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:39,205
Yes. [laughs]
That's always good to know.

1172
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,741
Well, those are some
very big shoes to fill.

1173
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,043
She got some big feet, so, yeah.

1174
00:51:43,067 --> 00:51:44,844
Exactly. [laughs]

1175
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:45,912
Thank you, Kahmora.

1176
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,147
Thank you.

1177
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:48,915
Ladies, show of hands.

1178
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,350
Who likes surprises?

1179
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:52,385
- Me!
- Love 'em!

1180
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,486
Oh, goodie.

1181
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,446
Three queens stand before me.

1182
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,660
What?

1183
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:04,364
Ladies, this is your
first chance to impress me

1184
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:09,560
and save yourself
from getting the porkchop.

1185
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:12,939
The time has come... [thunder]

1186
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,266
for you to lip sync...

1187
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:21,839
..for your life.

1188
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,753
Nobody puts Burner
in the corner, okay?

1189
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,154
Because I'll tell you what.

1190
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,256
I didn't come all this way
to watch these bitches beat me.

1191
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,829

I'm just trying not to throw up.

Ladies, I've made my decision.

1238
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,171
I would give up masturbating
for a year

Damn, I just won!

1243
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,679
And the choices I made
I will deal with.

1244
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,959
That means Kahmora Hall
and Elliott,

1245
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,427
I'm sorry, my dears,

1246
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,788
but you are both
getting the porkchop.

1247
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,491
Porkchop?

1248
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,461
I don't like pork chops.

1249
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,877
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi!

1250
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,113
- Hello!
- Hi!

1251
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:41,748
Okay, what is going on?

1252
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,283
Hi, hi, hi.

1253
00:55:43,307 --> 00:55:44,951
I'm seeing
all these other girls.

1254
00:55:44,975 --> 00:55:47,387
I see Denali, my Chicago sister.

1255
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:49,122
I'm normally the queen

1256
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:53,259
that knows all the twists
and the gags and the goops.

1257
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:54,827
But this is throwing me
for a loop.

1258
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,430
So you all just both lip synced.

1259
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:58,865
- We just lip synced.
- Yeah.

1260
00:55:58,889 --> 00:55:59,866
Oh, my God.

1261
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,267
- Porkchop.
- Yeah.

1262
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,903
Welcome to all the people
who went home first.

1263
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:05,205
They can't send us home.

1264
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,040
They can kind of do
whatever they want.

1265
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,308
No!

1266
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:09,542
I object.

1267
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,344
We're trying to figure out
what's going on.

1268
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,879
This is what we've been
talking about this whole time

1269
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,581
is is this the real tea?

1270
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:17,450
Here we all are
in the porkchop lounge,

1271
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,019
who famously went home first.

1272
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,755
So is that what's gonna happen
to all of us?

1273
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,123
I'm not okay with that.

1274
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,694
I wonder what the winners
are doing right now?

- Aah!

00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,576
Yes!

Child, everyone in New York City

1285
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,682
knows Tina auditions every year,

1286
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,218
and God bless her heart.

1287
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,419
She is ancient.

1288
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,587
I love her to death,

1289
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,356
but she needed to get on
before she died.

1290
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,658
- Hi, mama!
- Hi!

1291
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:00,493
New York is in the house!

1292
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:01,928
Oh, goodness.

1293
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,730
Okay, we've got a New York girl

1294
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,432
that is a comedy queen
and a campy queen.

1295
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,901
You always gotta watch out
for those girls, honey,

1296
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,037
because they may not
be gorg in the face,

1297
00:57:11,061 --> 00:57:13,239
but that don't mean shit.

1298
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,109
Competition register locked.

1299
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,878
So I'm guessing you won
your lip sync as well?

1300
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:20,046
I did. Did you?

1301
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,848
Mm, well, we're sitting
right here, bitch.

1302
00:57:21,872 --> 00:57:23,616
We're all the winner's circle,
all right.

1303
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,817
- All right!
- Winner's circle!

1304
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,954
I lip synced
against a New York sister.

1305
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,589
Oh.

1306
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,790
Rosé.

1307
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,349
Rosé's here?

1308
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,585
Oh, here we go.

1309
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,599
Olivia beat Rosé in a lip sync?

1310
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,602
Miss Olivia Lux, who's been
doing drag for 10 seconds?

1311
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:45,872
So I'm thinking
Rosé's beside herself.

1312
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,340
Because, like, Rosé is, like,

1313
00:57:47,364 --> 00:57:48,641
a little more
of a seasoned queen.

1314
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,576
She got, you know,
America's Got Talent.

1315
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,214
She is... "I was on The Voice,"
you know, "I can sing."

1316
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:58,084
Well, I guess
you couldn't lip sync.

1317
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:01,087
Wait, so are
the other girls gone?

1318
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,221
Do you think they're still here?

1319
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,389
- They have to be.
- They have to be.

1320
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,591
- It's not us.
- I have no idea.

1321
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,527
But what I do know
is that we here.

1322
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:09,896
Aah! [laughs]

1323
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,431
We're stunning, we're winners,

1324
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:14,901
and, baby,
may the best woman win.

1325
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:16,569
Come on, Season 13!

1326
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,362
Yes!

1327
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,607
Did you guys lip sync
against each other?

1328
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,142
It was us
and then one other queen.

1329
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,243
Who were you against?

1330
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:25,478
Tina Burner.

1331
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,679
Oh, fuck.

1332
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,281
She's here! [laughs]

1333
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,016
Tina's from New York.

1334
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,184
So are you from New York, too?

1335
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:32,218
I'm from New York.

1336
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,620
And Tina won
against you beauties.

1337
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:35,788
That fucking bitch.

Me and Tina work
in the same circles.

1340
00:58:39,149 --> 00:58:40,793
I like Tina.

1341
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,261
I don't think Tina likes me.

1342
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:46,199
What in the heck do you think
is about to happen next?

1343
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:47,333
We're gonna de-drag
at the airport...

1344
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,768
Our picture's
gonna be on the wall

1345
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:51,237

we want to wish you
safe travels,

wherever your final
destination may be.

1353
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,760
Okay, so everything
I just said, forget it.

1354
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:15,194
I guess we're going home
instead.

1355
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,263
Mm, girl, I told you.

1356
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,998
The lady said... go home.

1357
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,857
The lady said go home.

1358
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,271
For me, this is really,
really emotional,

1359
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,873
because this means
the world to me.

to show the world anything

1362
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,979
of what kind
of drag queen you are,

1363

it's just the period
on a really shitty day.

- Yes?

00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:45,525
you just eliminated
half of the cast, right?

1367

Oh.

All is not lost.

of your fellow queens the chop.
