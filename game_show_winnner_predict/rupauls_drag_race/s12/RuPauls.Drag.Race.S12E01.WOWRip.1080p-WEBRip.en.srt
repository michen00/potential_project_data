00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,037
Looking for a new
political party?

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,707
Are you tired
of politics as usual?

4
00:00:06,707 --> 00:00:07,908
I'm Donald Trump,

5
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:10,410
and I do not approve
this message.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,546
Join the RuPaul's
Drag Race party!

00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,014
♪ I am American... ♪

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,752
Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of opulence!

9
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:22,022
Let's meet your candidates.

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,459
Here we go, sis.
Ha-ha!

11
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,828
Y'all thirsty?

12
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,030
[laughs]

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,902
Ahh.

14
00:00:34,902 --> 00:00:39,273
My name is Brita and I am
the queen of New York City.

15
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,141
I'm the first bitch here.

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,342
Aah!

17
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,778
Everyone who knows drag
in New York City

18
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,113
knows who Brita is.

19
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,181
I was really hoping
the other girls would be here

20
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,150
so that
they could see the winner.

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,119
I have seven shows a week
in New York City.

22
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,120
I literally do it all:

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,721
commercials, TV,
singing, dancing.

24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,256
I took over New York City,

25
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:59,126
and now it's time
to take over the world.

26
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,460
Oh, girl, I look good.

27
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,129
Most people think I'm like,
a big ol' black lady,

28
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,464
but I'm a Polynesian princess.

29
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:05,866
My dad is from
the kingdom of Tonga.

30
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,834
Out of drag,
I'm definitely Maui,

31
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,070
and then at night,
I turn into Moana.

32
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,405
I guess we'll just wait

33
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,107
for those other ho's
to come out. Yes, mama.

34
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,609
I'm so excited.

35
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,946
I can't wait to see these other
girls that I'm gonna beat.

36
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,054
Well, that was a long flight.

37
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,556
[speaking French]subtitles

38
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,824
I am originally
from Paris, France,

39
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,527
and recently relocated
to New York City.

40
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,028
My looks are very inspired

41
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,930
by European runways
from the nineties,

42
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,865
and my performances are dancey

43
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,834
without all the shenanigans
and the splits and all that.

44
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,036
So I'm bringing glamour...

45
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,671
without breaking my hip.

46
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,239
Hello!

47
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,308
-Nicky Doll.
-Mwah-mwah.

48
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,344
Nicky Doll, oh, yes!
You're from New York City!

49
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:52,346
-Yes!
-Look at you, mama!

50
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,982
You like my little
Jean Paul Gaultier realness?

51
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,184
Yes, come on,
New York City queen.

52
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,119
Wait, aren't you
from somewhere else, too?

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,887
I'm originally
from Paris, France,

54
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,489
but I moved to New York
a year and a half ago.

55
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,024
Oh, I see.

56
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,492
Nicky Doll is the fashion queen,

57
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,395
and she's gonna bring beauty,
grace, and a cute little lace.

58
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:12,466
But she ain't comin' for me
in the performance area.

59
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm happy to see that there's
another New York queen here.

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,470
I know, right?
I'm gonna win, though.

61
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,537
Yeah, well,
I'll tell you goodbye

62
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:20,140
when it's the right time.

63
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:27,748
Relax your throat, bitches,
'cause you're gagging.

64
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,216
[laughs]

65
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:32,019
It's Widow Von'Du.

66
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,121
30 years old,
but you couldn't tell.

67
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,423
I mean, she looks good, though.
[laughs]

68
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,557
Werk, bitch.

69
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,726
Slay mother goose, mother god.

70
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,928
For those of you
that don't know me,

71
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:45,165
I am the nastiest bitch
from Kansas City.

72
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,933
And for those of you
that do know me...

73
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,869
you're fucking welcome.

74
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,070
[laughs]

75
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,973
Hi! How are you?

76
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:54,374
-Good. How are you?
-You look gorgeous!

77
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,977
Oh, my God.
Yes, bitch, you are beat!

78
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,145
Come on, big girl.

79
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,180
They call me The Thiccums
herself, honey.

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,715
Get you a taste.
Look at this.

81
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,717
Get into all of this.

82
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,918
All of it.

83
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,055
And that's all,
with like four As, eight Os

84
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,222
and three Ls.

85
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,257
"Aaaaoooooooolll!"

86
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,658
Yes, bitch.

87
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,726
[laughs]

88
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,094
How do you feel being sandwiched

89
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,729
in between us two
big girls right now?

90
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:19,066
I feel safe.
I've got my security guards.

91
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,268
You know, just in case
another ho is super jealous.

92
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,036
The big girls
about to bring it

93
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,104
to these little skinny ho's.

94
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,505
They better be prepared.

95
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,674
Jackie: Roll call!

96
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,544
I know that bitch.

97
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,346
I'm Jackie.

98
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,850
Salaam! The Persian Princess
of drag has arrived.

99
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,685
Aah!

100
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,420
I'm Jackie Cox,
and I'm 34 years young.

101
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,422
I am a Middle Eastern nerd,

102
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,492
and I am the Persian
Annette Funicello of drag.

103
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,461
-Oh, hello!
-Oh, my God, Jackie!

104
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,130
-Aah!
-Aah!

105
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,166
I'm so excited to see Jackie Cox
in the workroom.

106
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,035
That's my sister from NYC.

107
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,169
-Oh, my God!
-We made it!

108
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,171
I know someone,
I know someone.

109
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,073
-Right?
-Jackie Cox is the queen

110
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,876
of the cabaret scene
in New York City.

111
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,311
-What are your names?
-I'm Widow.

112
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,979
Widow, I'm so sorry.

113
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,114
[all laugh]

114
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,815
I do a little comedy,
I do a little singing.

115
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,917
I love performing off Broadway.

116
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,486
Ta-da!

117
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,654
I love to drop into a character.

118
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,089
Wait.
What does your dress say?

119
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,824
Oh, it says my name in Farsi.

120
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:20,594
So it says Jacqueline in Farsi.

121
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,129
-Oh, Jacqueline.
-Oh, I love it.

122
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,463
But watch out,
because Jacqueline

123
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,866
is also the name
of my evil twin.

124
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:28,668
Jackie is not really
so much of a look queen.

125
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,637
I know that she's gonna
bring her smarts to the show,

126
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,507
But I don't know
if she's gonna give us

127
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,877
the glamour that you need
for RuPaul's Drag Race.

128
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:38,678
Three New York City queens
so far

129
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,080
Three? Oh, 'cause
you're from France.

130
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,848
-Yeah.
-I'm like, France!

131
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,216
New York City!

132
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,653
In the house, honey!

133
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,126
America, it's time
to stop hiding in the closet.

134
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,764
[high-pitched trill]

135
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,100
What the fuck
is this bitch doing?

136
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,201
[high-pitched trill]

137
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,103
All right, tongue power.

138
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,972
Okay, is someone trying
to come for my culture?

139
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,242
You know, it sounds a little bit
like a Persian trill.

140
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,811
I see you're not the only

141
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,613
cunning-linguist
in this group here.

142
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,282
[all laugh]

143
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,883
I am Heidi N Closet.

144
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,785
I am 24 years of fabulousness,

145
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,387
and I am from Ramseur,
North Carolina,

146
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,122
where the chickens
outnumber the people.

147
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:25,692
Heidi is serving
her pimp-tress outfit.

148
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,494
I know I look good in
my...subtitle

149
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,464
Aah!

150
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,934
My drag is very SPF 100.

151
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,269
Sassy, professional, fierce,

152
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,470
and she keeps it 100.

153
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,239
What kind of drag do you do?

154
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,107
Well, she is more of
just a performance queen.

155
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,909
She's always ready
to dance and twirl

156
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,544
and kick and everything.

157
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:47,681
The most important part to me
in drag is to be entertaining.

158
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,749
Because
if you're not entertaining,

159
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,750
it's like watching the wall dry.

160
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,620
Is that how you say it?

161
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,088
Producer: Mm-hmm.

162
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,623
-Oh, my gosh, we're here.
-Yeah!

163
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,725
Crazy.

164
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,393
[high-pitched trill]

165
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,095
That's my mating call.

166
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,897
Clearly, I'm single.

167
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,665
[all laugh]

168
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,802
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

169
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:16,376
Ahoy.

170
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,444
My name is Gigi Goode,

171
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,179
and I'm not just good,
I'm incredible.

172
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,114
When I am entering a room
in drag,

173
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:25,218
I really am trying to have
that Cinderella story moment

174
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,721
where everyone is just
kind of like, who's that bitch?

175
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,425
Argh, mateys!

176
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,327
I love it, honey!

177
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,031
The Pirates of the Caribbean
was in town. Oh, my God.

178
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,633
Is one of her legs a peg leg?

179
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,001
I need to know right
now.subtitle

180
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,138
Fashion
means everything to me.

181
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,475
I see my drag
going to the cover of Vogue.

182
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,743
Period.

183
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,946
Hey, everybody!
What's up?

184
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,915
Hi, I'm Gigi!

185
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,516
I've heard about you.
I've seen you on Instagram.

186
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,751
You're like, fierce.

187
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,419
So nice to meet you.

188
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,955
Okay, so Gigi Goode
is also bringing fashion.

189
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,290
I know her from Instagram.

190
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,392
She's definitely
going to be tough competition,

191
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:07,294
and I can't wait
to put her down.

192
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,995
I am living
for this outfit of yours.

193
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,097
Thank you.
My mother made it.

194
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,666
Birth mother
or your drag mother?

195
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,468
-Both.
-Your mom is your drag mom?

196
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,770
Technically, yeah.

197
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,271
She's a theatrical
costume designer, so most--

198
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,240
Oh, yes.
Are you a good seamstress?

199
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,708
-I'm sure, 'cause--
-I am.

200
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:23,076
My mom taught me
how to sew, so--

201
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:25,578
Awesome.
How old are you?

202
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,280
I'm 21 years old.

203
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,581
-21.
-Oh.

204
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,717
Fresh off the boat.

205
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,786
[laughs] Oh.

206
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,721
I think
the first impression of me

207
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:39,025
is going to be "Oh, God,
here's another fashion queen,

208
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,462
no personality, no talent,
no humor."

209
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,497
I'm going to prove each
and every one of them wrong.

210
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,733
-We're here.
-We're here, Isn't it wild?

211
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,668
H-E-A-R, hear.

212
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,270
I was hoping to be
the skinny one. Nope.

213
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,404
Maybe All Stars.

214
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,406
[all laugh]

215
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,078
-Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh.

216
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,080
Who's ready to party and play?

217
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,016
Checkers anyone?

218
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,051
Michelle Visage's nightmare
just arrived.

219
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,887
I'm Crystal Methyd,
and I'm a little devil

220
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,656
that likes to raise hell
in the Bible Belt.

221
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,691
I spit.

222
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,393
You can typically catch Crystal

223
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:16,596
rocking bright colors,
tropical print and cheetah.

224
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,631
I think the most impressive
thing I bring to the table

225
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,999
is my sick moves.

226
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,969
I'm known as the dancing diva.

227
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,971
No.subtitle

228
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,306
[laughs]

229
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,641
I think my most impressive
drag talent

230
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,876
would be my makeup skills.

231
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,511
I want to make sure that
these other girls know

232
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,012
that you're never gonna know
what to expect

233
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,314
from Crystal Methyd.

234
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,416
Oh, my God!

235
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,284
[laughs]

236
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,786
It's not just the season
of New York now.

237
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:41,721
It's now the season of Missouri.

238
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,290
-Missouri's in the house!
-Yes!

239
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,692
Crystal, good to meet you.

240
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,794
Crystal? Just Crystal?
Crystal Methyd.

241
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:49,429
Oh.

242
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,131
Crystal comes jumping
into that workroom

243
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,633
looking like something
jumped out of the box.

244
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,269
All of a sudden, I'm hungry
for, you know, a croissant-wich.

245
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,340
So you're like a look queen,
comedy queen, clown queen?

246
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,008
I'm a look queen,
I'm a comedy queen,

247
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,743
I'm a talented queen.

248
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,845
[all laugh]

249
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,180
You can definitely tell
that these other bitches

250
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,350
are feeling some type of way
about Miss Crystal.

251
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,051
But y'all better be ready.

252
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,153
The bitch is fierce.

253
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,488
Ooh, bring on the next girl.

254
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,557
-No.
-Let's go, where are you?

255
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,194
[alarm]
Ooh, girl!

256
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,431
She done already
done had herses.

257
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,032
What in the hell is going on?

258
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,435
Ru-Mail is playing and...

259
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,437
there's only me
and six other bitches here.

260
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,105
Wait, is this it?

261
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,706
What the hell is going on?

262
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,476
Can somebody tell me where
the rest of the bitches at?

263
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,011
Hey, racers.

264
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,479
-Hi!
-Hi!

265
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,080
Are you drop-dead gorgeous?

266
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,516
Do you slay well with others?

267
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,986
Because whether you're a part
of a lucky seven,

268
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:51,191
a baker's dozen
or a mènage á trois...

269
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:56,396
-Ooh.
-I'm looking for that bitch.

270
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,698
[tongue pop]
Yes, girl!

271
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,536
Hello, hello, hello!

272
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:07,106
[cheering]

273
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,510
Welcome to RuPaul's
Drag Race 2020.

274
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,745
[cheering]

275
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,849
Now, this is a year
of life-changing choices,

276
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,484

to help save the world.

279
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:28,228
So I am proud to announce

#DragRace.

282
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,436
Now, I have to warn you.

283
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:40,306
It's a crowded field
of candidates this season.

284
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,942
So to get to know
each of you better,

285
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,378
we're not just having
one premiere.

286
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:48,114
We're having two premieres.

287
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,451
And you lucky seven
are the first group of queens

288
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,786
to make your case to the nation.

289
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,921
-Yes.
-Yes.

290
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,489
First in, best in.

291
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,125
For your very first
mini challenge,

292
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,228
it's Fashion Week
at RuPaul's Drag Race,

293
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,797
presented by Bubly
Sparkling Water.

294
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,399
Come on, bubbles.

295
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,469
I want to see all the fun
and flavors of fashion

296
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:11,404
as you slay the runway

297
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,207
in both a Spring
and a Fall look.

298
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,676
-Oh.
-All right.

299
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,912
I'm like so excited
for this mini challenge.

300
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,614
I want to be walking the runway
in Fashion Week.

301
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,216
Like, how fucking fun is it?

302
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,218
I take fashion very seriously,

303
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,820
so I need to fucking
nail this challenge.

304
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,756
Now, I know for a fact

305
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:33,059
that major players
in the fashion world

306
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,228
watch Drag Race for inspiration,

307
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,830
so let them have it.

308
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,433
Oh, God.

309
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,235
I'm hella nervous right now,

310
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,270
because with there
only being seven of us here,

311
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,307
the microscope
is on each and every one of us,

312
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,541
and any little slip-up

313
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,143
could send us
right out that door.

314
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,646
Racers, your campaign
for the crown starts now.

315
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,886
RuPaul: The winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race

320
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,270
RuPaul: Presenting
the Spring Collection.after
teaser

321
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,305
You never get to see
the Summer Collection.

322
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,674
No, that's resort.
Summer is resort.

323
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,675
I prefer cruise.

324
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,844
-You do.
-I heard.

325
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,346
For our very first
mini challenge,

326
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,114
it's Fashion Week,

327
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:32,085
and we have to walk in
both Spring and Fall categories.

328
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,853
I am like, so excited.

329
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,488
Oh, wait,
the show is starting.graphic

330
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,860
Serving fashion
for spring, Brita.

331
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,862
Brita: This is so exciting.

332
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,331
Ru is there, Michelle
is there, Carson is there.

333
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,067
I see Raven.
Oh, I love Raven so much.

334
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,836
Grab a tulle
and start banging.

335
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,438
I look like a waterfall fairy,

336
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,875
with all this tulle
swishing around like water.

337
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,443
I let it go and it releases

338
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,445
and then you see
just strand of tulle

339
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,382
just following behind me
like a trickling stream.

340
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:05,051
Make it known,
Brita is here!

341
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,853
Oh, I guess she's not
gonna take the train.

342
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:09,055
She's gonna walk.

343
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,690
RuPaul: Nicky Doll.

344
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,859
Carson:
She's very wisteri-ous.

345
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,527
Nicky: For the spring look,

346
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,229
I'm serving you nymph
going to Olympus,

347
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,031
and I am on Zeus's list, bitch.

348
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,866
Michelle: She's lilac-tating.

349
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,534
Nicky: When it comes
to drag aesthetic,

350
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:25,471
France is highly inspired
by runways and high fashion.

351
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,706
This is what I do.
I'm a look queen.

352
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,241
Carson:
I can see her "oui-oui."

353

I'm poppin' the shit
out of this runway,verify

357
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,520
wearing all the brightest
of neoprene.

358
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,488
That's my look.
A ratchet-ass queen

359
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,424
with some high-class fashion.

360
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,859
It's hot.
Let me take my jacket off.

361
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,761
Boom! Matching bra.

362
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,762
What's that? Nero-prene.
What's it called?

363
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,731
-Neoprene.
-Neoprene.

364
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,100
I'm on it right now.
It stops the internal bleeding.

365
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,936
Widow: Most big girls, they're
afraid to be who they are.

366
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,272
They see all the skinny girls
wearing absolutely nothing,

367
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,406
and they're like, Oh, my God,
I can't do that.

368
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,708
Fuck that.

369
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,677
Carson: If you liked it,
you should've put a hood on it.

370
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,713

00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,587
I always bring
a little bit of retro-glam

374
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,621
into whatever I'm doing.

375
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,424
I love Barbara Eden,

376
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,426
so the nods to Barbara Eden
in the hair,

377
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,428
the little spit curls
on my cheeks,

378
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,930
Not only do they hide
my sideburns,

379
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,466
but they're freaking cute.

380
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:29,268
'Cause a lady
do always have a purse.

381
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:32,105

RuPaul: Welcome to Timbuktu.

385
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,214
Carson: I love
the way this drapes.

386
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,416
I mean, it is drapes.

387
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,417
Literally.

388
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,752
Heidi: I am super excited

389
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:48,321
to show these judges
who Heidi N Closet is.

390
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,456
She's giving genie in a bottle,

00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,692
psychedelic
Springtime realness.

392
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,961
It represents me being
just over the top,

393
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,864
glamorous, splashy,
sparkly head to toe.

394
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:01,000
And all of a sudden...

395
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,604
You could see
her civil rights hair.

396
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,839
Oh, Lord!

397
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,474
But I keep going.

398
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,577
I keep going,
and that's important.

399
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,845

00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,989
It's Easter Sunday

404
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,323
I just joined
a lesbian motorcycle gang

405
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,926

407
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,196
Gigi: This is what
I excel in.

408
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,498
I am a fashionable bitch.

Crystal: This is a pretty
girly look for Crystal Methyd.

415
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,646
It's colorful, it's creative,

416
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,049
it's intentionally
over-accessorized.

417
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,020
I feel most comfortable
when I am being a weirdo.

418
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,755
Carson: She has got to stop
putting Viagra

Jackie: My sense of fashion
is a little bit more old school

457
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,079
than some of the other girls.

458
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,715
Mom got a divorce,
and she's never been happier.

459

Jackie: I love that ability

460
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,621
to kind of create this
whole fantasy of silly people,

461
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,789

00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,640
I love that hair, girl.

529
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,810
My dad had a mullet that was
like, down to his crack, so...

530
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,745
-Wait, really?
-I'm trying to get there.

531
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:15,314
Who would have thought
that behind this clown makeup

532
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,416
was such a cute twink?

533
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,918
What does your tattoo say?

534
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:22,321
I got it at a concert,
and it says "One Direction"

535
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,823
No, I don't trust you.

536
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,125
You have a tattoo that says
"One Direction" in Arabic?

537
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,660
Yes.

538
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,328
-Do you speak Arabic?
-No.

539
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,464
But I didn't want
everyone to know

540
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:33,866
that I had
a One Direction tattoo.

541
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,868
[all laugh]

542
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:36,869
I guess y'all
are wearing clothes.

543
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:37,870
I should just
put on something

544
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,971
because I feel like a ho
right here.

545
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,339
-You don't have to.
-No, that's fine.

546
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,274
No one's gonna make you
put clothes on.

547
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,778
Jackie,
damn, Jackie is hot.

548
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,713
I definitely can see
where all the hummus go.

549
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,049
'Cause come on, bubble butt!

550
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,452
Hummus, the hummus.subtitle

551
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,721
-She's Persian.
-Oh, hummus!

552
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,556
Hummus. Oh, my God!

553
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,092
-I'm sorry. [laughs]
-Girl.

554
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,628
Hey, squirrel friends.

555
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,630
[cheering]

556
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,831
Where'd all the ladykins go?

557
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,501
They're gone, packed away.

558
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,639
Ladies, now that we've had
a sneak peak of your fashion,

559
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,708
it's time to dig
a little bit deeper.

560
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,943
Now, for your first
maxi challenge,

561
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,248
you'll be performing
the bad-ass rap single

562
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,883
I'm That Bitch.

563
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,819
[cheering]

564
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,420
Now, each of you needs
to write her own verse,

565
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,356
and as a group,

566
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,725
you need to work together
on the choreography.

567
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:36,362
Uh-oh.
[all laugh]

568
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:37,730
Now, this is your big chance

569
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,499
to introduce yourselves
to the world

570
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,701
and break out from the pack.

571
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,437
Gentlemen, start your engines,

572
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,872
and may the best woman--

573
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,276
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

574
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:53,379
I can't believe I almost forgot
to tell you this part.

575
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:56,282
-Uh-oh.
-Okay.

576
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,251
Not only will you be
performing your rap

577
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,853
on the main stage,

578
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,288
you'll be performing it

579
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,825
in front of our extra-special
guest judge.

580
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:09,929
Young Money!

581
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:11,730
Shut up!

582
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,065
Miss Nicki Minaj.

583
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,901
[cheering]

584
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,537
That's right,
Think pink, bitches.

585
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,706
Holy moly.

586
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,876
Nicky Minaj is going to be
judging my rap skills,

587
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,612
and I have never rapped
in my life,

588
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,948
so I am terrified.

589
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:33,452
Gentlemen, start your engines
and may the best woman win.

590
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,955
All right, we got this.

591
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:38,224
-Whoop, whoop!
-I'm that bitch.

592
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,925
I am that bitch.

593
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:44,063
I am so excited
for this challenge.

594
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,664
It's a motherfucking
rap challenge!

595
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,666
I've never even
sang karaoke before.

596
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,835
I love to rap and write music.

597
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,737
This is my shit, like--

598
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,939
But are you good at it?

599
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,941
There's a difference
between people writing stuff

600
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,243
and being good at it.

601
00:22:57,243 --> 00:22:58,344
Are you good at writing?

602
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,578
Are you good at doing music?

603
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,280
I went to school
for musical theater, like--

604
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,282
Going to school and doing it
are two separate things.

605
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,417
Oh, baby, I've been in
Broadway national tours.

606
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,254
Don't come for me.

607
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,789
I'm gonna sound like
Weird Al Yankovic.

608
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,792
I don't know if people
would consider Jackie Cox

609
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,095
really having a lot of flavor,

610
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,464
but I do love
writing parody lyrics.

611
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,899
Does anyone know
a good rhyme for naughty?

612
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,002
-Body.
-Ody, ody, ody.

613
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,271
Body. Body.
That's not a bad one.

614
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,272
Shoddy.

615
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,508
Shady lady, Peter Brady.

616
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,011
-[chuckles]
-You don't love that?

617
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,312
Well, start packing.

618
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,313
[all laugh]

619
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,814
All right, guys.

620
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,116
Well, so far I think
I'm that bitch, so...

621
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,219
Okay. Then we got to
figure out how we're dancing.

622
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,854
Are we ready
to put together a number?

623
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,156
Well, bring your ass
over here and let's see.

624
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,357
[speaking French]

625
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,694
-What?
-That's French.

626
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,130
I'm gonna take the
Meredith Vieira spot over here.

627
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,464
Okay, raise your hands

628
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,634
if you feel comfortable
choreographing at all.

629
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,370
I've had some experience
choreographing

630
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,239
like for other girls
back at home.

631
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,473
Widow?

632
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,175
I choreograph my talent numbers
when I do my pageants.

633
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,443
I have six backup dancers
sometimes,

634
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,979
and, I mean, but we dance.

635
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,781
-Right.
-I think that the people

636
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:11,116
that are used
to choreograph shows weekly,

637
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,451
should probably
take the lead.

638
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,520
Heidi and Widow should do it.

639
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,056
Before we do that,
who actually dances?

640
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,325
Okay, well, let me tell you,
I can't even touch my toes.

641
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,693
Oh.

642
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,728
I mean, in the girl group
that I am in,

643
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,030
I am the slowest learner.

644
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,233
I am so concerned right now.

645
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:32,404
It's hard working with bitches
who don't dance.

646
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,706
Can we at least
just not over-complicate it?

647
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:37,009
Like, let's keep it like
Spice Girls level of dancing.

648
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,411
Heidi and I are nominated

649
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,147
to be the leads
of this choreography.

650
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,315
I've watched this show enough.

651
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,752
If you are the captain
of this ship,

652
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,354
you are going down.

653
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,028
-Oh!
-Oh!

654
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,464
Where the magic happens.
Oh, my God.

655
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,833
It is now time for us
to start doing choreography

656
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,501
for I'm That Bitch.

657
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,504
Nicki Minaj is going to be
like 15 feet away from us.

658
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,406
And we're gonna
knock it out of the park.

659
00:25:07,406 --> 00:25:09,675
I think we should have
our choreographers--

660
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,677
I'm looking at you two--

661
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,112
you open it since
we're gonna rely on you

662
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,880
for this first choreography.

663
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,415
All right, chocolate sister.

664
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,684
Let's choreograph this shit.
All right.verify

665
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,452
So I was thinking
that what we should do

666
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,055
is three come in from here,
three come in from here,

667
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,124
and you march down
as if you're--

668
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,125
we're the Bad Bitch Army.

669
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,927
♪ I--I--I'm a bitch ♪

670
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:31,063
♪ I--I'm a bitch,
I--I--I'm a bitch ♪

671
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,101
Of all of these girls,

672
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,904
I'm probably
the least coordinated.

673
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,940
Can people crump?
Can everybody crump?

674
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,710
Nope.

675
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,345
I don't know dance moves,

676
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,546
I don't know terminology.

677
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,814
I can't even count.

678
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,616
Five, six, seven, eight.

679
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,019
I'm just gonna look
so dumb doing that.

680
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,320
I'm gonna be honest right now.

681
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,024
But goddamn it, I'm gonna
fucking pull it together,verify

682
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,959
and I'm not gonna
let myself go home.

683
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,863
Hit it.
One, two, three, four.

684
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,398
-Okay.
-So three is a circle.

685
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:09,034
One, two, three, four.

686
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,804
Widow, she keeps on
pulling out the same moves.

687
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,107
She just keeps on
doing this little thing.

688
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,479
Just kept on keeping.

689
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:25,617
That's okay, but like
what else do you got?

690
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,488
Yeah, "don't you wish"

691
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,823
is when you should
start marching out.

692
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,091
I think that we should
switch it up just for variety.

693
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,493
Do something like, simple.

694
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,494
First we got
to get out here first

695
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,428
before we start switching it up.

696
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,496
I think if we had like

697
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:39,064
staggered movements
at certain times.

698
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,700
'Cause the focus is
supposed to be on the soloist.

699
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,801
Unless you want
the four of us

700
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,869
to just strut
on that first four.

701
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,504
They're already strutting,
I mean--

702
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,706
That's the way it is,
don't--don't--don't you wish?

703
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:48,841
-I like that.
-You could be that bitch.

704
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,943
Miss Jackie and Miss Brita.

705
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:55,347
You two ho's, shut up
and let me do my job.

706
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,050
Or we can just drop,
take a knee,

707
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,487
watch Brita go,
work, hype her, yeah.

708
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,822
No. That's--no.

709
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,791
I think if there were
like moments of like, pose.

710
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,493
Okay, switch, pose.

711
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:10,796
But we've seen routines
of bitches just posing.

712
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,633
[sighs]

713
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,370
I hope you can hear all that air
I just exclaimed from my body.

714
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,505
We can do like--

715
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,839
you know the type of--
like J-Lo choreography

716
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,674
where it's like
Human Centipede thing?

717
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,042
Yeah, I love that.

718
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,277
Not the human centipede!

719
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:29,181
I'm feeling some auras
from Widow.

720
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,718
Like I can feel the steam
coming off her wig.

721
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:34,887
Widow's frustrated,
and I don't blame her.

722
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,855
We can't get through
a single move.

723
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,024
People keep chiming in
on what they want to do.

724
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,193
That's when
you start behind me.

725
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,029
[all talking]

726
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,732
There are just too many
motherfucking chefs

727
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,901
in this goddamn kitchen.

728
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,069
I think we should go ahead,
because there's six verses,

729
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,871
and we're stuck
on the first one now.

730
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,006
Augh!

731
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,275
The time is ticking

732
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:59,278
and we all trying to put
our own little zest of lemon

733
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,281
in the choreography,
and it's not going anywhere.

734
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,682
I think someone
should take the lead.

735
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,484
-Yeah.
-We talk too much.

736
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:06,885
It's got to be
one of you two.

737
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,153
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:09,354
Do you want
to take the lead or--

739
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,355
Honestly, I don't know.

740
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,157
I've been trying
to give lead advice,

741
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,825
but no one wants to listen,
so I'm like, girl.

742
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:14,893
We want it, we want it.

743
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,161
If you feel uncomfortable
doing it,

744
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,063
then take the lead, honey,
please.

745
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,032
'Cause you're already coming up
with stuff that's good,

746
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,266
and I think
we just need to like do it.

747
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,435
Okay. So we need to find
the easy choreography

748
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,437
that we're gonna re-use
for each person's--

749
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,872
You know what?

750
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,206
I'm just gonna sit here
and be quiet. Fuck it.

751
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,408
Y'all want to do it?
Go ahead.

752
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,642
Show me what you got.

753
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,378
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Go ahead.

754
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,913
I think to open it up,

755
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,649
we could just do the posing
for like the first part,

756
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,619
and then choreograph later on.

757
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,623
Miss Widow, when I started
taking control a little bit,

758
00:28:44,623 --> 00:28:46,992
I could feel like all daggers
pointing at me.

759
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,460
I think we should start
on stage.

760
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,728
I think that would be best.

761
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,296
So it starts
with me and Venom.

762
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:53,999
-She called me Venom.
-Venom, oh, my God.

763
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,434
-Why'd I call you Venom?
-Venom?

764
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,072
I think we should go a little
bit like cliche rap song.

765
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,873
When they start clapping,
we can just like twerk.

766
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,442
I can't twerk.

767
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,077
You can twerk, Brita.
Come on.

768
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,947
Brita has a hard time catching
up with the choreography,

769
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,683
and she seems to be
shaking in her boots.

770
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,453
In New York, she has
such a big reputation.

771
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,756
So I'm surprised to see her kind
of buckling under the pressure.

772
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,957
But you ain't that bitch.

773
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,159
It's unanimous, uh, uh,
I'm that bitch.

774
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,495
Wait. One minute. Sorry.

775
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:26,431
Okay, we have some work to do.

776
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,835
Homework.
We're gonna need to practice.

777
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,671
I mean, we still have parts
to like figure out, though.

778
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,174
At the end of the day,
I'm nervous as hell.

779
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:37,309
We barely have anything.

780
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,111
Like I can't go home.

781
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,812
I have to represent
for New York City.

782
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,280
[pretending to cry]

783
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,182
Oh, my God!subtitle

784
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,022
That's right.

785
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,224
Come on! First runway.

786
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,861
It is time for us to get ready
for the first judging,

787
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,529
and the motherfucking stakes
are high.

788
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,133
Last night's rehearsal
was shit,

789
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,870
and I am nervous as all hell.

790
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,506
I'm glad we got to work
a little bit more last night.

791
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,708
I stayed up all night long,
practicing, so...

792
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,243
I did not sleep a wink.

793
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:13,545
I didn't get to rehearse like
everyone else did last night,

794
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,546
so I'm a little worried.

795
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,348
Why? What's up?

796
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,250
I actually had
a really bad allergic reaction,

797
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,852
and I had to be taken
to the emergency room.

798
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,087
Last night?

799
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,623
After an hour of sleep,
I'm running on adrenaline,

800
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:25,757
so, I mean, we'll see.

801
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,092
We're relying on you

802
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,694
to turn some stunts and tricks
in this number, so...

803
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:31,730
I'm a little nervous
because back at home,

804
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,065
I'm known as a dancer.

805
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,767
And if I go home
on a dance challenge,

806
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,636
that's gonna be like the crack
of the century for me.

807
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,740
-Jackie.
-Yeah?

808
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,942
So I know that you have
a Persian background.

809
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,277
Yeah, we're like
international queens,

810
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,979
I was born in Canada,
but I'm half Persian.

811
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,682
I'm terrified
of Persian people seeing this

812
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,250
and like,
what's that gonna be like,

813
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,319
because it's not okay.

814
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,155
Like being gay is still
punishable by death in Iran.

815
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,791
-Really?
-Yeah.

816
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:00,926
Oh, my God.

817
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,794
I've never met
another Persian drag queen.

818
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,531
I know very few Persian members
of the queer community

819
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,533
because it's such a dishonor
to your family,

820
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,535
and that's where I struggle.

821
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,305
Because I really started
to embrace my Persian heritage,

822
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:14,606
but also knowing

823
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,475
that there's a pretty oppressive
government in Iran

824
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:18,310
that would rather see me dead.

825
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,812
My experience living in Morocco.

826
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,648
I moved there when I was 12,
which is like--

827
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,051
When you're queer, like 12
starts to get to be the age

828
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,320
where you start to realize
that you're different.

829
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,822
And being in a country,
like, say,

830
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,492
where you could go to jail
for being who you are.

831
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:35,093
Is it illegal in Morocco, too?

832
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:36,628
If you kiss someone in public,

833
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,663
people can call the cops
and you end up in jail.

834
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:39,831
Wow.

835
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,166
So I didn't come out

836
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,701
until I came back
to my country

837
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,869
because I didn't feel safe
at all.

838
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,505
We complain,
but there's places where

839
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,875
it is way harder for us
to just even exist.

840
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:50,942
But we got
to keep fighting for it,

841
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,377
because this election
is coming up,

842
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,380
and I don't want this country
to go the way of some others.

843
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,882
Nope, nope, amen.

844
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,517
I want any kid
who feels like

845
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,318
they're culturally not allowed
to be who they are

846
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,989
to realize that
you can be gay and a drag queen

847
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:06,892
and anything you want to be.

848
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,630
Are you guys feeling ready
for the choreography?

849
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,500
Yesterday during rehearsals
I was feeling very overwhelmed.

850
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,669
Oh, my God, me, too.

851
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,271
Widow, I can tell
you were getting

852
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,906
a little frustrated yesterday
in rehearsal.

853
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:21,940
You still mad at us?

854
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,209
No.

855
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,310
Did you let it go?

856
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,046
I know I'm gonna stand out
in my part,

857
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:30,415
but I'm worried
that Jackie and Brita

858
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,851
are gonna throw me under the bus

859
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:36,054
because I was nominated
as the dancing choreographer.

860
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,890
And I don't want to go down
with this ship.

00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:19,657
This outfit represents my drag

1041
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,594
because I love dressing up
like a beautiful monster.

1042
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,762
Nicki: Yummy.

1043
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,165
RuPaul:
I guess it's today, Satan.

1044
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,233
[all laugh]

1045
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,034
Gigi Goode.

1046
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,203
Carson: Worst case
of helmet hair I've ever seen.

1047
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,272
Michelle: She's jaded.

1048
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,674
Gigi: Gigi does not
use rhinestones,

1049
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,911
so tonight on the runway
I'm using glitter.

1050
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,714
Just head to toe, clean lines.

1051
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,783
I feel stunning.

1052
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,319
Nicki: Yes, chicness.
Love it.

1053
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,621
Michelle:
The bike still running?

1054
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,890
Heidi N Closet.

1055
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,426
Michelle:
Heidi sings the blues.

1056
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,997
Heidi: I am living
my rich woman fantasy,

1057
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,465
and I'm going slow.

1058
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:03,001
And I want them to count every
last one of these riboles.

1059
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:07,305
I want them to know she paid
a nice dollar for this gown.

1060
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,740
RuPaul:
Come on, pussycat wig!

1061
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,141
Michelle: Yes!

1062
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,110
Carson: I got to pick up some
ramen noodles. That reminds me.

1063
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,746
[all laugh]

1064
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,347
RuPaul: Jackie Cox.

1065
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,683
You've got to climb
Mount Everest

1066
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:20,285
to reach
The Valley of the Dolls.

1067
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:23,154
Jackie: I'm walking out like
I'm emerging from her boudoir.

1068
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,822
And she takes her doll

1069
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,059
and that doll will make her
sparkle, Jackie, sparkle!

1070
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,061
You got a prescription
for those?

1071
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,697
Jackie: This outfit is very
representative of Jackie

1072
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,499
because it's a little retro,

1073
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:36,334
but has a little bit
of that modern twist.

1074
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:38,503
RuPaul:
Miss Bouvier, you stay.

1075
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:41,039
Carson: Oh, bee-hive now.

1076
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:43,341
RuPaul: That's a reach.

1077
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:47,478
I'll leave the way I came in.

1078
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:48,880
Nicky Doll.

1079
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,783
Carson:
I've heard of feathered hair,

1080
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,085
but never a feathered bosom.

1081
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,253
Nicky: My runway look tonight

1082
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,922
is iron, metal-like feathers.

1083
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,825
Vixen makeup, bad bitch that
you don't want to mess with.

1084
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,694
And I'm here to con-kere.

1085
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:04,128
Con-kere?

1086
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,031
Conquer. Conquer.
I'm here to conquer.

1087
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,701
RuPaul: Mask for mask.

1088
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,536
Widow Von'Du.

1089
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,238
Oh, damn!

1090
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:15,440
She's ready for takeoff.

1091
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,541
Michelle: She is.

1092
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:19,711
Nicki: I love the earrings.
Obsessed.

1093
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,845
Widow:
My drag is in your face,

1094
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,747
like you can't help
but look at it

1095
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,549
and that's what
my sparkle look is.

1096
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,017
It's what Judy Jetson
would wear

1097
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,720
after she took over
the company.

1098
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,656
Now she saying, "Bitch
better have my sprockets."

1099
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,091
[laughs]

1100
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:34,859
RuPaul: It's like
the Sydney Opera House.

1101
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,261
It is.
Why go all the way there

1102
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,730
when you can just look
at her shoulders?

1103
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,466
RuPaul: Yeah.
[all laugh]

1104
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:42,934
RuPaul: Welcome, ladies.

1105
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,303
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1106
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:47,772
starting with Brita.

1107
00:41:47,772 --> 00:41:49,040
Hello, Brita.

1108
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,641
Hi, nice to meet you.

1109
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:54,145
The thing that stands out to me
about you is your energy.

1110
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:55,780
You seem inviting.

1111
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,282
That's really, really
a good thing in show business.

1112
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:02,920
Your looks in the fashion show
were both very beautiful.

1113
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,255
You know how to shape your body.

1114
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:08,226
I can tell that just from
seeing you on one episode.

1115
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,428
This runway look
certainly is sparkly,

1116
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,464
but what I'm really appreciating
are all the details.

1117
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,267
You're creating a narrow waist
with the peplum flare.

1118
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,402
You look like a pro.

1119
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,636
Thank you.

1120
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:21,706
Your lyrics didn't really
tell me much about you

1121
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,207
except that you want to win.

1122
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,709
And what I love
about what we're doing here

1123
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:25,943
is we're taking the time

1124
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,945
to really get to know
each and every one of you.

1125
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,480
Because when
you're all crammed together,

1126
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,882
we don't get as much time.

1127
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,650
But when we want to get to know
you, we want to get to know you.

1128
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,252
100%.

1129
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,920
I know they said
you didn't say too much.

1130
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,956
But as a rapper, to me,
what you said about yourself

1131
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,126
was that you're cocky,
you are optimistic,

1132
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,494
and you don't doubt yourself.

1133
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,164
And when it comes to rap
or show business,

1134
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,565
I think those three things

1135
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,767
are actually really, really
freakin' good!

1136
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,502
Thank you so much. Aah!

1137
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,372
Up next, Crystal Methyd.

1138
00:42:54,372 --> 00:42:56,307
Are those boots Prada?

1139
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,708
No.

1140
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,844
It was The Devil Wears Prada
joke. Anyway...

1141
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,646
Just note to the director.

1142
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:04,816
Put some laugh track
under his last statement.

1143
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:05,817
[all laugh]

1144
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,652
My favorite thing
that you did

1145
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,320
was that Freddy Krueger fashion.

1146
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,522
It was very gorgeous,
very chic.

1147
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,025
The bandages, the hair,
genius idea.

1148
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:17,261
With your rap, I love that
you said "Make my mama proud,"

1149
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,497
because ultimately,
that's what we all want to do.

1150
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:21,499
I mean, that's what I wanted
to do when I started rapping.

1151
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:23,334
So, tch-tch,
good job with that.

1152
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,938
Tonight, she's cute,
she's costume-y.

1153
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,639
I can't wait to see what else
you got in your wheelhouse.

1154
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,308
Thank you.

1155
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,743
Up next, Gigi Goode.

1156
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,814
Your fashion show choices
were fantastic.

1157
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,316
You love a helmet, too.

1158
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:40,218
Three out of four looks
have incorporated helmets.

1159
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,285
I do love a helmet.

1160
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,720
[all laugh]

1161
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,455
What I loved the most
about your rap

1162
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,058
is that you had
a double entendre in it.

1163
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm just here to win
and leave a bitch on read.

1164
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,695
Literally,
I would steal that line.

1165
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,463
Like, that's a real rap line,

1166
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,432
and I want you
to really understand

1167
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,766
that's a real rap line.

1168
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,702
Because you're talking
about reading a bitch

1169
00:43:57,702 --> 00:44:00,004
and also leaving them on read
on your phone.

1170
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:02,673
So when I saw
that you said that,

1171
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,675
I was like, who the fuck
is this bitch?

1172
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,411
[all laugh]

1173
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,414
Up next, Heidi N Closet.

1174
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,483
-Heidi N Closet.
-Yeah.

1175
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,818
What made you choose that name?

1176
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,586
I was from a very small town

1177
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:19,223
and there's
a lot of straight men

1178
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,658
who would always try
to get my goodies.

1179
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,928
So basically it was
a lot of undercover brothers

1180
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:26,197
trying to holler at you
where you from.

1181
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,265
Oh, all of them.

1182
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:29,000
Heidi N Closet,

1183
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,668
What was your second choice?

1184
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,504
Sasha Nicole Fierce,
but you didn't--

1185
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,540
[laughs]

1186
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,741
-No.
-Okay, this is

1187
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:39,110
where I'm gonna press
the trap door button.

1188
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,546
Aah!

1189
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:43,514
Where are you from?
Small-town girl, you said.

1190
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,750
I'm from Ramseur,
North Crack-i-lacky,

1191
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,285
and we're outnumbered
by chickens.

1192
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,421
B-b-b-b-b-bawk.

1193
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,957
[laughs]

1194
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:54,559
In the fashion show,

1195
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,095
you know, you had a moment
with your headpiece falling off.

1196
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,031
You did pick it up and carry on,

1197
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,065
so I want
to applaud you on that.

1198
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,066
Thank you.

1199
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:03,868
And then this look
on the runway,

1200
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,903
it's opalescent oppalance.

1201
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:12,109
But I hate, hate, hate
your hair and makeup today.

1202
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,412
The wig and the makeup

1203
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:15,913
could have enhanced
your face even more

1204
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,817
to match this beautiful gown
that you have on.

1205
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,620
What's your experience like
in this challenge?

1206
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,090
It's been crazy.

1207
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,426
Last night
I got back to the hotel

1208
00:45:28,426 --> 00:45:31,395
and just welts and hives

1209
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:33,731
just started down my arms
and down my legs,

1210
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,533
and I had to go to the ER.

1211
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,834
Wow.

1212
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,669
So you had
an allergic reaction last night?

1213
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,837
Yes, I did.

1214
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:43,274
We narrowed it down
to the hotel's detergent

1215
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,243
or something that I may have ate
for the first time, kale.

1216
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:47,678
That'll do it.

1217
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,513
Kale will not do that, no.

1218
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,282
Goddamn kale.

1219
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:54,252
I'll never eat kale again.

1220
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:55,319
Don't--oh, my goodness.

1221
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,654
Never!

1222
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:58,456
If you were hospitalized
last night

1223
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:01,092
and you came out here
and did the performance you did,

1224
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,827
you are a superstar

1225
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:06,364
and you have a very genuine
spirit and your spirit shines.

1226
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:09,300
Up next, Jackie Cox.

1227
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,768
Salaam, RuPaul June.

1228
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,603
Sounds delicious.
I'll have two.

1229
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,472
I want to talk about
your fashion looks right away

1230
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:16,173
because they were
some of my favorites.

1231
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:17,675
I loved the Spring.

1232
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:20,211
it was very sixties, very
Laugh-In, very Oleg Cassini.

1233
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,113
And I love this look.

1234
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,515
Your rap was so fantastic.

1235
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:29,286
I really got to know
who you were from that.

1236
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,588
I love that you said

1237
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,657
"Just like my girls, Laverne,
Deb, and Courtney."

1238
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:34,625
And I love that you rhymed
naughty with Courtney

1239
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:37,528
because most people would have
had the obvious rhyme scheme

1240
00:46:37,528 --> 00:46:40,464
for a word like naughty,
you know.

1241
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,667
I love that you're
a proud Persian queen.

1242
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,068
One thing
that I am going to tell you

1243
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:46,404
because you are of Persian
decent and your hair is dark,

1244
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:48,706
we're already seeing
the bleed-through on the beard.

1245
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:51,642
This is going to be
the bane of your existence.

1246
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,244
But if you need help
with something,

1247
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,079
now is the time to look around

1248
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,080
and say "I love
the way you do this.

1249
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,248
Can you give me some tips?"

1250
00:46:57,248 --> 00:46:58,949
You got it, Michelle.

1251
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,552
All right, we've got another
Nicky in our midst, Nicky Doll.

1252
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,987
Hi, RuPaul.

1253
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,689
Let's talk about
your fashion looks.

1254
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:08,559
That beautiful kind of hasidic
meets Jean Paul Gaultier,

1255
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,161
which was really chic.

1256
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,196
This look is something

1257
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,598
that like Pink or Robyn
would wear on a tour.

1258
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,033
Like, it is stunning.

1259
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:20,004
Your face is just
shutting everybody down.

1260
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,239
You look like a Barbie
out of the box.

1261
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,240
Thank you so much.

1262
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,408
I wanted to let you know also

1263
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:27,311
that I named myself
Nicky Doll after you.

1264
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,713
Well, you are doing me proud.

1265
00:47:28,713 --> 00:47:31,282
Tonight in your performance,

1266
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:35,252
I felt you a little bit
unsure of yourself.

1267
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,520
What was going on with that?

1268
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,656
I just feel like

1269
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:42,860
I've been watching the show
for so many years overseas.

1270
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,929
And standing there
in front of all of you,

1271
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,497
it was just overwhelming.

1272
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,399
You never have
to second guess it.

1273
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:51,035
The reason you're here
is because Ru picked you.

1274
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,939
So just let those voices go away
'cause they don't matter.

1275
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:56,941
How do you say saboteur
in French?

1276
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:59,610
-Saboteur.
-It's a French word.

1277
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,745
[mouthing]

1278
00:48:00,745 --> 00:48:01,812
Oh, you knew that?

1279
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,081
Put the laugh track in
over that.

1280
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,216
I got it. I laughed.

1281
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,753
Up next, Widow Von'Du.

1282
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,621
I love the Missy Elliot
kind of reference

1283
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,790
with the neoprene neon.

1284
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,258
You put your thing down,

1285
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:17,094
you flipped it and reversed it
with that hood action.

1286
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,395
Ooh, going there.

1287
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,798
Yeah, you know I'm into
a little bit of rap myself.

1288
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:23,300
[all laugh]

1289
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,807
What I loved most was your rap
and the performance.

1290
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:31,108
It was some next-level shit.

1291
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,777
Thank you.

1292
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:35,479
Lyrically, Miss Lady,
when I heard the line,

1293
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,715
"'cause they rub together
like they harmonize,"

1294
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:38,716
I was like in here screaming.

1295
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:41,919
I was just like,
yes, thank you!

1296
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,923
RuPaul: Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1297
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,459
Now, while you untuck backstage,

1298
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:51,495
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1299
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,598
All right,
now just between us Barbs,

1300
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,734
what do you think?

1301
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:57,868
Brita.

1302
00:48:57,868 --> 00:48:59,003
I mean, I just like her energy.

1303
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,572
She's so positive
and has a joy about her

1304
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,274
that I kind of
want to see more of that.

1305
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,276
When a person
can make you feel happy,

1306
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,946
that transference of energy,
like that goes a long way.

1307
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,481
Crystal Methyd.

1308
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:11,782
I get a little bit worried

1309
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,952
when they pigeon-hole themselves
into one specific thing.

1310
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,154
'Cause she had the same makeup
on for the fashion show.

1311
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,490
If she can step up
with the fashion and the makeup

1312
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,792
and match that
with how funny she is

1313
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,260
and how charismatic she is,

1314
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,997
then she is going to be
like such a big threat.

1315
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,199
Gigi Goode.

1316
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,301
She nailed it
on a different level

1317
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:33,637
with that green and the latex.
Oh, my God.

1318
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,373
And it looks like she has
a personality under that, too.

1319
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,209
'Cause a lot of times,
fashion queens will come on,

1320
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,510
they're like,
"I'm fashion, I'm fashion,"

1321
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,312
and there's
no personality there,

1322
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:45,716
So to have her like that with
a personality is very exciting.

1323
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,585
Heidi N Closet.

1324
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:51,655
It is my job to convince her
to change that name.

1325
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,725
Worst name ever,
but in the performance,

1326
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,894
I mean, she was like reenacting
Death Becomes Her.

1327
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:59,830
Her head was like everywhere.

1328
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,467
When you can perform like that
while still lip syncing

1329
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:10,307
and like slay-ana all day,
like that in itself is a show.

1330
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:14,612
I think Slay-ana is a better
name then Heidi N Closet.

1331
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:17,147
[all laugh]
Absolutely.

1332
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,883
Jackie Cox.

1333
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:20,351
Well, I love all Cox.

1334
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:22,887
-Same.
-Especially Jackie.

1335
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:25,456
She's very smart.
Her lyrics showed that.

1336
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,124
She's in on the joke with us

1337
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:31,028
and like knows how to play to us
without playing to us.

1338
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,129
I like that.

1339
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,432
She gets fashion.
She gets period fashion.

1340
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,035
She gets fashion, period.

1341
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,570
[all laugh]

1342
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,239
Nicky Doll, en francais.

1343
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,141
Her performance
in and of itself was good.

1344
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,110
But when she was doing
the group parts,

1345
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,247
I saw her kind of really
laying back and being insecure.

1346
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,282
So I worry about that.

1347
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:53,183
But something about that accent

1348
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,754
just gave me everything
I didn't know I needed.

1349
00:50:56,754 --> 00:50:58,656
Like, coupled with the fact

1350
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,624
that she was more laidback
in the performance

1351
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:05,629
to me made her now turn into
this mysterious Paris girl.

1352
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:06,864
She knows how to do
her own makeup,

1353
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,265
she knows high fashion,

1354
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:11,869
and she's
drop-dead beautiful, period.

1355
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,106
Widow Von'Du.

1356
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,309
Her Spring runway was fun.

1357
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,277
It was like this is bad-ass.

1358
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,013
When you put her on that stage,
she shines.

1359
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,482
And that's what we love,
seeing people perform.

1360
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,718
At the end of the day,
you can wear a beautiful dress,

1361
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,019
beautiful this, beautiful that.

1362
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,156
But we like attitude
and charisma on the stage

1363
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:34,158
and energy and fun,
and she brought all of that.

1364
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:36,660
I want to see more, more, more.

1365
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,896
I want to see what
the Widow's gonna Von'Du!

1366
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:41,165
Up in her!

1367
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,666
Now, Nicki, I'm curious.

1368
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:46,503
What would your I'm That Bitch
rap sound like?

1369
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:50,074
Okay, I would say
something like this.

00:51:50,074 --> 00:51:52,977
