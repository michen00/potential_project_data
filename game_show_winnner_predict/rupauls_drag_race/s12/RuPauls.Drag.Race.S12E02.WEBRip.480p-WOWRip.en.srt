We're back in the workroom
after our "elimination,"

00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,032
and everybody's gagged.

17
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,900
So what do you guys think
happens from here?

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,203
Girl, I have no fucking idea.

19
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,738
-Anything can happen.
-Yeah.

20
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,307
I think
what's gonna happen is

21
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,375

She done already

00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,891
I just sat down.

29
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,192
Hey, ladies.

30
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:35,228
Good job this week.

31
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,098
So are you ready to meet
the other queens?

32
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:41,568
No!

33
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,437
Leave a message on the mirror,

34
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,073

-Oh!
-Oh!

36
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,645
-No way.
-All right.

37
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:54,514
I hope these bitches
are ready to eat the leftovers,

38
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,617

you do when you're number two.

-Yeah!
-Yes, honey.

42
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,924

what's coming to them.

of RuPaul's Drag Race 2020.

58
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:55,609
All tuck and no play
makes Rock M. a crazy bitch.

00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,245
[laughs] Whoo!

60
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,680
Whoo!

Woop, woop, woop, woop!

62
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,550
I'm Rock M. Sakura,
and am I really Japanese?

63
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,819
Who knows? Is it
cultural appropriation?

64
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,622
We'll find out. Stay tuned.

65
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,623
Where should I go next?

66
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,558
Should I just sit on the stairs?

67
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,595
A lot of my influences come from
anime, manga, and video games.

68
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,165
Rock M. is very indicative
of Rock'Em, Sock'Em Robots,

69
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:20,167
because I got big arms
like these.

70
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,635
How sturdy are these tables?

71
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,604
I am a high-energy
comedy anime queen

72
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,840
that can dance, sing.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,843
She's just a big explosion
of legs and arms

74
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,411
and some other body parts

75
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,680
that you might not even want
or care to see.

76
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,681
Huh!

77
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,283
It's so exciting to be here.

78
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:40,454
This is my chance to show
the world that I'm a superstar.

79
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:42,189
What's over here?

80
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,260
"We done already
done had ourses?"

81
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,563
What does it mean?

82
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,231
Were there people
that are already here?

83
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,969
Oh, no!
There's already stuff here.

84
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,038
Aah! Aah!

85
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,245
Are you ready to live a little,
sin a lot?

86
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,348
I'm Dahlia Sin,
and I'm here to take your man.

87
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,050
Eew. [laughs]

88
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,252
I'm from the Haus of Aja,

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,554
who you might know
from Season 9 and All Stars.

90
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,090
The Haus of Aja
is definitely known for drama.

91
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,092
All we do
is talk shit about--

92
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,528
[laughs]
talk shit about everyone.

93
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,730
-Hi-ee!
-Hi, honey.

94
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,931
-Welcome, new sister.
-You look gorgeous, bitch.

95
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,100
Oh, mwah.
You look like a chandelier,

96
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,835
but like a sexy,
denim chandelier.

97
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,038
Oh, oh, oh.
Come on, denim, look good.

98
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,039
I'm Rock M. Sakura.

99
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,008
Oh--oh--oh, okay, bitch.

100
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,176
I'm from San Francisco.

101
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,811
-Oh, okay, nice.
-What about you?

102
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,646
Well, I'm from New York,
but I currently live in L.A.

103
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,081
-Okay.
-And we gonna win.

104
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,549
Ooh, ooh.

105
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,152
Don't count out
San Francisco yet.

106
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,187
I actually live
for San Francisco.

107
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,322
The San Francisco queens
are cunt comedy queens.

108
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,991
L.A. is more of a look.

109
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,159
Okay, when I get there,

110
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,660
the first thing they notice
is the smell.

111
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,861
[both laugh]

112
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,596
I definitely consider myself
a look queen.

113
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,331
My style is very Vanjie.

114
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:01,935
It's fierce, it's better
than all these other bitches

115
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,503
that are gonna be on the show.
[laughs]

116
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,678
Hope you saved room for dessert,
because I brought Pie.

117

[laughs]

118
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,250
I'm Sherry Pie, and I am
the queen of camp. Ooh.

119
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,418
You're a funny little lady.

120
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,787
Oh, yeah, oh, ooh.

121
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,857
Sherry is a big, loud,
Broadway dame.

122
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,959
When you enter
a Sherry Pie show,

123
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,664
I expect nothing less than
laughs, hoots, and hollers.

124
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,533
Yes, bitch!

125
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,469
-Hi, Mama!
-Hi.

126
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,771
I'm so excited.

127
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,174
I want that crown
on top of my wig.

128
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,777
I'm, like, gagged, gooped,
beguiled,

129
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,912
bewitched, bothered,
and bewildered.

130
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,514
That's a musical theater
reference

131
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,616
for all you kids
out there. Hello.

132
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,084
-I'm Rock M.
-Hi.

133
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,186
Rock M. Sakura.
I'm from San Francisco.

134
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
I haven't really seen
the drag there.

135
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,323
What's it like?

136
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,791
My brand is very,
like, dumb humor.

137
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,092
Slay.

138
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,260
If you think about it
driving to the gig,

139
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,494
and be like, "This song is dumb.

140
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,130
I wanna do it like this
and dress like a hot dog."

00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,001
Oh, I want a hot dog
real bad.

143
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,636
Okay, I'm gonna stare at myself.

144
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,174
[whistle blows]

145
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,475
Oh, oh, oh.

146
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,246
Hey, y'all,
let's play some basketball.

147
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,847
Yes!

148
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:25,352
I'm Jan, I'm 26,
and I'm from New York City.

149
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,920
I hope everybody
caught the reference.

150
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,289
If you heard Fergie
singing the national anthem

151
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,457
at the NBA All Star game,

152
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,559
you know that she ended that

153
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,027
saying, "Let's play
some basketball."

154
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,696
Basketball?

155
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,033
I am wearing my varsity
cheerleader outfit.

156
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,401
My look just really encapsulates

157
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,236
everything that I am
as a drag queen.

158
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,538
It's fun, it's flirty,
but it's fierce.

159
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,806
-Hi!
-Hi!

160
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,809
I gagged to see Jan come in.

161
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,444
She's a New York City sister.

162
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,847
She has an amazing voice,
she's an amazing actress.

163
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:54,848
Hi, I'm Jan.
Nice to meet you.

164
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,182
Jan, nice to--oh, Jan.

165
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:58,118
Jan [bleep], right?check

166
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,920
Oh, it's just Jan.

167
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,388
-Just Jan.
-Yeah.

168
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:02,956
Just Jan!
[all laugh]

169
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:06,993
Bitch, come on. New York in
the motherfucking house, bitch.

170
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,429
Yeah, New York City!

171
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,464
Coming up
in the New York City scene,

172
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,634
I really, really wanted to get
to the top very, very quickly.

173
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,369
I'm really ambitious,
I'm very driven,

174
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,604
and I don't apologize for that.

175
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,639
And I'm just ready
to go Team Jan.

176
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,842
What's that mean?

177
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,545
There's messageseses.

178
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,647
Oh, Jesus, people are--
oh, my--wait.check

179
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,249
There's already queens here,
girl.

180
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,151
Some of these stations
are filled.

181
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm shocked. I'm confused.

182
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,524
-Oh!
-Oh, oh, oh.

183
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,260
Hey, bitches.

184
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,896
She's here!

185
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:45,131
She is a woman.

186
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,133
Hey, bitches,
it's Jaida Essence Hall,

187
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,368
the essence of beauty,

188
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,504
and I'm here to slay
the competition.

189
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,840
When Jaida walks in a room,

190
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,611
she's very classy, very bougie,
she smells like money.

191
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,747
Turquoise, ooh.

192
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,948
I look fabulous,

193
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:02,982
I'm wearing something
that's off-the-shoulder

194
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,217
so you can catch
all of these shoulders

195
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,752
and all of that good zhuzh
up here.

196
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,654
Her shoulders.
That's all I can talk about

197
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,223
are her gold,
glistening shoulders.

198
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,527
They should sell her shoulders
at Barney's.

199
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,596
Hello!

200
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:18,665
-You look hot.
-Thank you.

201
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,433
I'm living for
the beat bitch in person.

202
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,434
I have to say this color

203
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,869
looks beautiful on you,
by the way.

204
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,505
-Thank you. Thank you.
-You look amazing.

205
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,973
She's like, "You're welcome."

206
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,175
Although I support
any other styles of drag

207
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,343
and I like the art of it,

208
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:34,247
for me, drag is exuding,
like, feminine energy.

209
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,250
I don't consider myself
really too much of a drag queen,

210
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,718
but more
of a female impersonator.

211
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,086
Jan: What's your drag like?

212
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,155
I sew professionally.
I have, like, a fashion line.

213
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:43,356
-So did you make this?
-Yes, I made it.

214
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,925
Like 99% of the things
that I brought I made.

215
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:49,629
What do you feel like
is mainly your style of drag?

216
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,531
I'm a singer, really.
That's my main thing that I do.

217
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,532
-Oh, sing something right now.
-Yeah.

How about you sing,
and then she lip syncs it?

223
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,911
Five, six, seven--

00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,692
Season 12
is about to be in-Zhane.

227
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,128
We got a spooky queen.

228
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,164
I am Aiden Zhane,

229
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,866
and I am here to slaughter
the competition.

230
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,903
Okay, she's the odd one.

231
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,106
I think the other queens
are immediately gonna be like,

232
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,841
"Oh, this is the weird bitch."

233
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:39,446
People would probably describe
my drag as kind of mysterious.

234
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,848
I don't think there's really
another drag queen out there

235
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,016
that you can compare me to.

236
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,985
You can try, but good luck.

237
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,654
-Hi!
-Hi!

238
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:49,823
-I'm Sherry.
-Aiden.

239
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,025
You can sit next to me.
I love crazy.

240
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,827
Tell us what your scene's like.

241
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,162
Well, isn't that the question?

242
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,430
[all laugh]

243
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,765
Do you have the answer?

244
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:02,001
Atlanta, it's not very diverse,
I guess.

245
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,405
You know, I wish there was
more room for just crazy.

246
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,706
Is that what you do?

247
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,676
Yeah, I'm definitely
a little bit psychotic, so...

248
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,711
-Wow.
-Sickening.

249
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,080
So if I'm coming to see you
in a show, what do I expect?

250
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,784
I'm definitely an actress,
first of all.

251
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,520
Like, I love to emote,
I love to give expression.

252
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,691
When you say you're an actress,
do you have drama training?

253
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,559
No, I don't have any, like,

254
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,361
actual background training
in acting.

255
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,762
Rock: Where do you perform?

256
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,298
See, the closest city
for me to perform is Atlanta,

257
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,800
and it's like an hour away.

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,502
How many times a week
do you perform, then?

259
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:38,271
None a week, currently.

260
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:41,841
Well, then how
do you do drag there?

261
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,510
[all laugh]

262
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,044
My drag background, I would say,

263
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,080
is a lot different
from a lot of queens.

264
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,250
I don't have
the same performance background,

265
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,118
because I don't have
drag family.

266
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,753
I don't really have
that many drag friends.

267
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,656
But don't let that fool you.

268
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,024
We need to talk about

269
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,727
this mysterious message
on the mirror.

270
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:05,565
It says, "We done already
done had ourses."

271
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:08,835
Are we having another Shangela
or Vanjie moment?

272
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,037
I think
it's a Season 6 moment,

273
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,972
where half of the dolls
are already here.

274
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,507
Jan: We should Nancy Drew it.

275
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,476
I wanna try
to clock this spoof.

276
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,412
Damn, some of this stuff
looks real cute.

277
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,114
Some of it
also looks real tacky.

278
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:22,181
[all laugh]

279
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,017
Can we just take a bunch
right now,

280
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,051
since they're not here?

281
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,085
I think we should hide
everything.

282
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,922
[alarm]
Oh!

283
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,125
RuPaul: She done already
done had herses.

284
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,893
Yo, ma'am!

00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,696
My queens.
[cheering]

286
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,566
Remember,
it's not about who comes first,

287
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:42,168
it's about who comes hardest.

288
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:47,173
So put some Fosse in your posse
and razzle-dazzle me.

289
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,708
Five, six, seven, eight--

290
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,144
Oh, wait a minute.

291
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,479
There's only six of you...

292
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,381
for now.

293
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,017
[all laugh]
Ooh, bitch!

294
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,589
[evil laugh]

295
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,160
What's a "Fosse?"

296
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,562
Hello, hello, hello.

297
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,998
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

298
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,001
-Oh!
-RuPaul!

299
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:20,073
Welcome to the second premiere
of RuPaul's Drag Race 2020.

300
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,109
[cheers and applause]

301
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,310
Now, you may have noticed

302
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,779
that you're not the first queens
to arrive.

303
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,615
-Yeah.
-I see.

304
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,317
Now, this week, you six
get your very own premiere

305
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,288
so we can scrutinize every inch

306
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,890
of your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent.

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,259
#DragRace.

308
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,863
So to kick things off, we wanna
see what you're packing.

309
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,132
So for today's mini-challenge,

310
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,235
you need to model
a Spring and Fall look

311
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:54,140
worthy of a star-studded
Fashion Week runway show.

312
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,342
[cheering]
Yeah!

313
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,478
Jaida: I'm so excited that there
are two runway looks on day one.

314
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm excited to see who the hell
is gonna be out here.

315
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,149
I wanna meet some celebrities

316
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,251
and just show these judges
exactly what I'm made of.

317
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,086
Are y'all ready
to change the world?

318
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,755

319
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,891
I'll see you on the runway.
Let's go.

320
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,162
It's faster this way! Oh!

it's Andre Leon Talley.act 2

323
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,373
Don't look.

324
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:28,374
I owe him 20 bucks.

325
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,642
[whispers] Oh, no.

326
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,344
So we have our very first
mini-challenge today,

327
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,513
and it's anything but mini.

328
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,149
We have to do a Spring
and a Fall look.

329
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,751
I don't wanna have,
like, a fashion disaster.

330
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,921
Fingers crossed.

331
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:45,325

00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,195
Ross: Anime-zing.

334
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,797
I know that RuPaul's there,

335
00:13:50,797 --> 00:13:53,132
but I can't tell
who any of the other people are

336
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,834
because I am in focus mode.

337
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,404
Rock M.'s spring look is
inspired by Commes des Garcons,

338
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,574
and I can feel
my full haraduku fantasy.

339
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,342
I drew this design myself

340
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,645
because I want them to see
my full range of talents.

341
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:08,581
I want them to look at
the picture and then look at me

342
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,984
and go, "She is a drawing
come to life."

343
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,019
RuPaul: Come on, Afro Puff.

344
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,487
Ross:
If you can't wear yourself,

345
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,055
how the hell you gonna
wear somebody else?

346
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:17,590
[all laugh]

347
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,759
RuPaul: Dahlia Sin.

348
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,161
Michelle:
Now that's Andre Neon Talley.

349
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,431
RuPaul: Oh, okay.
Ross: Sin is in.

350
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,435
I got my drag name
based off of the Black Dahlia

351
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,738
and the seven deadly sins.

352
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,808
I'm feeling very sexy
with my big, orange pumpkin wig

353
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,210
and my fat ass pose

354
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,378
My body is everything
when I'm doing my runway.

355
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,780
Michelle:
Her lip gloss is poppin'.

356
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,782
And by her lip gloss,
I mean her ass.

357
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,951
[all laugh]

358
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,320
RuPaul: Sherry Pie.

359
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,888
Michelle:
Look, it's Sherry Tasselhoff.

360
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,123
She's huge in Germany.

361
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,357
[all laugh]

362
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,658
I wanna come in

363
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,862
as the camp queen
who also can do fashion.

364
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,632
So Sherry Pie is giving you
some old Hollywood,

365
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,667
some old New York City.

366
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,772
I am dripping in florals
for Spring groundbreaking.

367
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:06,873
RuPaul: Ooh, yeah, honey,

368
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,941
you better slice me
some of that Pie.

369
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,743
Ross: That Pie's got cake.

370
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,512
[all laugh]

371
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,181
Jan. No last name, just Jan.

372
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,116
Michelle: Marie Jan-toinette.

373
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:18,785
Jan: When I do my shows
in New York City,

374
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,686
normally I'm in a leotard.

375
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,155
But I'm excited to show people

376
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,489
that I have
a different side of me.

377
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,791
You're gonna be getting
some looks from me this season.

378
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,860
My spring look
is Dolce & Gabbana-inspired,

379
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,562
and it could also be interpreted

380
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,430
as "high on a hill
was a lonely goatherd,

381
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,932
leidey-odeleidy-odelei-hee-hoo."

382
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,700
RuPaul: Choke her?
I just met her.

383
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,670
[all laugh]

384
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,773
Jaida Essence Hall.

385
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,974
Ross: Peekaboo.

386
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,309
RuPaul: She's gonna put
somebody's eyes out

387
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,844
with those things.

388
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:48,714
I love just being
really ladylike, very dainty,

389
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,285
but it's still got cute details,
and it looks expensive as hell.

390
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,553
You see
a little bit of peekaboo,

391
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,421
and you get that
little bit of that sexy,

392
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,722
because that's what Jaida
is all about.

393
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,591
Ross: Ooh. Oh, oh.

394
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,226
Punch my titties.

395
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,361
[all laugh]

396
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,064
Aiden Zhane.

397
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,732
Ross: Category is Garden Ho.

398
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,969
-Oop. And a-oop.
-A-oop!

399
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,970
[all laugh]

400
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,238
Aiden: My Spring look

401
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,408
is very April showers
bring May flowers.

402
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,210
Aiden might be creepy,

403
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,513
but she is also
colorful and fun.

404
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:21,814
She loves to be cute,

405
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,050
but she's always got
a little bit of freak in her.

406
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,154
Michelle: The rain in Spain
falls mainly on Aiden Zhane.

407
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,622
RuPaul: A tree grows in Sylmar.

408
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,525
Well, you know, this season

409
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:36,395
is all about global warming
and bugle beads.

410
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:41,300
Now, serving fashion for Fall,
Rock M. Sakura.graphic

411
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,435
Rock: Koi toy.

412
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:46,138
For my fall look,
I'm feeling very fish.

413
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,074
I'm wearing
a classic mermaid skirt

414
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,776
that's made completely of felt.

415
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,845
I said I felt. [laughs]

416
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,114
I actually don't have
a lot of connection

417
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,817
to my Vietnamese
or Filipino background.

418
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:02,088
The culture that I have adopted
is cartoons, anime.

419
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:05,057
TV has raised and shaped me
into the person I am today.

420
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,060
RuPaul: Don't shoot till you see
the white of her eyes.

421
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,762
[all laugh]

422
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,230
Dahlia Sin.

423
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,001
Ross: Inspired by Michelle
before electrolysis.

424
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,936
[all laugh]

425
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:20,606
Dahlia: My fall look is the more
high-fashion version of Dahlia.

426
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,409
I give off very bitch face
when I'm in drag,

427
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,145
and people will not talk to me.
[laughs]

428
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,914
I just can't help it.
That's just my face.

429
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,350
I'm not really a bitch,
but I can be a bitch.

430
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,219
[laughs]

431
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,121
Michelle:
What becomes a legend most?

432
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,322
RuPaul: Alimony.

433
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:37,723
[laughs]

434
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,228
RuPaul: All right,
another helping of Sherry Pie.

435
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,730
Straight out the lovin' oven.

436
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,799
Or was it a Dutch oven?
[all laugh]

437
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,136
Sherry Pie's Fall runway
is a little bit of Zorro,

438
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:52,438
is a little bit of
Victor/Victoria,

439
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,441
and also I feel
a little James Bond.

440
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,477
Girl, I'm giving you
all the references,

441
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,546
because that's what drag queens
are supposed to do:

442
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,148
give you the fantasy.

443
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,418
RuPaul:
Does anybody still wear...

444
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,786
-A hat?
-A hat?

445
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,220
Ross: Jan.

446
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,723
RuPaul: Guacamole.

447
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,192
Ross: This fall, from Crocs.

448
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,460
[all laugh]

449
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,495
Jan is the girl next door,

450
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,597
but she's so much more
than just that.

451
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,499
A lot of the things that I like
are very sleek,

452
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,436
they're really polished,
they're sexy.

453
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,972
Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga,
Kim Petras,

454
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,807
all those looks
wrapped up in one.

455
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,141
RuPaul:
See you later, alligator.

456
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,443
Ross: After while, crocodile.

457
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,144
[all laugh]

458
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:35,147
Jaida Essence Hall.

459
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,249
I used to room
in Jaida Essence Hall.

460
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,552
-Oh, at college.
-Yeah, in college, yeah. Mm-hmm.

461
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,820
Come on, Tom Whored.

462
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,421
[all laugh]

463
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,957
Jaida: Growing up,
I always loved fashion,

464
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,325
I always loved art,

465
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,994
and I never thought that I
would have the chance to do it.

466
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,329
And when I found drag,
I'm like, oh, my God,

467
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,431
I can do everything
that I've always wanted to do

468
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,532
all the time.

469
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,600
And it's like home for me.

470
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,036
Ross: She's such a beret
of sunshine.

471
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,404
[all laugh]

472
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,506
RuPaul: Aiden Zhane.

473
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,975
She seems very cozy.
[all laugh]

474
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,111
Michelle: Somewhere there's
a bunch of tea kettles

475
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,612
that have no clothes on
right now.

476
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,614
[all laugh]

477
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,418
Aiden Zhane loves ugly things,

478
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,487
but fashionable things.

479
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,990
I am definitely a thrifty,
crafty kind of queen.

480
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,025
I'm not really a seamstress,

481
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,260
but I love
to piece things together

482
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,029
and, you know, find one item

483
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,965
and kind of map it out
from there.

484
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,433
The return
of Shields and Yarnell,

485
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,301
minus Shields.

486
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,070
And Yarnell.

487
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,838
[all laugh]

488
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,307
Bitch!act 3

489
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,308
Darling.

490
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,309
-Ooh.
-Ooh.

491
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,444
I can't wait to see

492
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,212
what you guys look like
out of drag.

493
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,114
We have been in drag
all morning,

494
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:46,252
and it is time to reveal
the beast underneath.

495
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,720
Oh!

496
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,089
I really don't wanna see
anybody out of drag.

497
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,590
[laughs]

498
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,892
We're taking our clothes off,

499
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,226
I'm looking to the left,
I'm looking to my right.

500
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,762
[humming burlesque music]

501
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,800
Meh.

502
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,334
[laughs]

503
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,770
My favorite part
about taking off the tights

504
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,640
is feeling that steam from,
like, the third or fourth layer

505
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,976
come out like
some sort of Hot Pocket.

506
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:13,512
-Girl, wow.
-[laughs]

507
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,314
That is so gross.

508
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,316
Girl, I about to get
a nerf burn.

509
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,985
[sniffing] I can--I can smell
the trade in the room.

510
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,087
Ugh.

511
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,390
Dahlia is trade central.

512
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,691
Aah!

513
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,994
My dumb ass didn't have,
like, any, like, underwear,

514
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,331
so I'm like, well, I guess
I'm getting naked. [laughs]

515
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:35,000
Like, my whole ass just right
on the first episode, bitch.

516
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,469
[laughs]

517
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,838
Dahlia looks hot
in and out of drag.

518
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,106
The bitch turns looks.

519
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,042
Ooh, you bitches
are looking mass for femmes.

520
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:45,978
Say hello to my double chin.
There she is again.

521
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,147
Do any of you have day jobs?

522
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,482
What's your day job?

523
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,817
Just a prep cook,
nothing exciting.

524
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,453
-What kind of restaurant?
-IHOP.

525
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,722
So you're good with knives.
That's good to know.

526
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,659
Aiden looks kind of
like backwoods-ish.

527
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,129
She looks like
she's gonna go huntin'.

528
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,864
You know, go trappin'.

529
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,733
I don't know what people do
in the woods.

530
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,101
♪ She's a boy now ♪

531
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,202
Rock M. has
the biggest transformation

532
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,737
out of all the girls.

533
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,807
I was not expecting
these little muscles,

534
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,642
little tight booty.

535
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,010
I just want to poke her butt.

536
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,746
Aren't y'all happy
we all getting along right now?

537
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,181
-I am.
-Are we?

538
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:25,651
Everybody here has brought it,
and I don't like any one of you.

539
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,353
[all laugh]

540
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:29,288
Hey, squirrel friends.

541
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,657
-Hi.
-Hey.

542
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,659
Who are you dudes?
[all laugh]

543
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,995
That's that RuPaul girl.

544
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:40,733
Ladies, now that you've shown us
your passion for fashion,

545
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:44,603
we need to see how well
you can captivate an audience.

546
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,739
So warm up your jazz hands,

547
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:49,608
because for your first
maxi-challenge,

548
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,711
you'll be performing
in an original musical number

549
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,781
called You Don't Know Me.

550
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,449
[cheers and applause]

551
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,618
Now, each of you
needs to write and perform

552
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,989
an entertaining verse
that tells us who you are.

553
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,958
-Word.
-And together,

554
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,060
you need to come up
with the choreography.

555
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,430
-Oh. Okay.
-Oh, no!

556
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,399
Now, this is your chance
to break out from the pack,

557
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,802
so don't fuck it up.

558
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,103
Yes, yes.
[applause]

559
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,406
I'm so excited.

560
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,608
It's a Fosse number,
it is in my wheelhouse.

561
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,210
I'm like, yes!

562
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,146
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

563
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,181
and may the best woman win.

564
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,550
[cheers and applause]

565
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,659
Our first challenge
is a Fosse-esque musical number.

566
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,762
I'm super-excited,
because I love Fosse

567
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,631
and I'm like, girl,
we're about to kill it.subtitle

568
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,301
[sigh] She--he--she?

569
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,569
He--she--she--

570
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,273
Girl, Fosse is
the main character of Chicago?

571
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,142
Is it? I don't know.

572
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,211
I'm bad with this.
Don't judge me.

573
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,146
Ooh.

574
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,350
Going into this challenge,
I feel pretty confident.

575
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,752
Musical theater is my life.

576
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,621
It's right up my alley,

577
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,689
and I can't wait
to bowl a fucking strike.

578
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,925
I'm excited because
it's the first challenge

579
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,760
that we get to do and we get
to showcase our strength.

580
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,028
I have a show back home

581
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:18,964
where I do a different
musical every single week,

582
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,232
and I drag it up.

583
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,668
So I'm really excited, actually.

584
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,337
The people who look the most
confident in this challenge

585
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:27,006
are sitting right next to me.

586
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,874
[tongue pop]

587
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,876
So I'm thinking
how can I set myself apart

588
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,845
in a very interesting
and fun way?

589
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,747
Honestly, I've never
written lyrics before,

590
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,516
so I kind of want
to hide behind a character.

591
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,451
I'm thinking of maybe
doing, like, an accent,

592
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,186
like Fosse 1920s.

593
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,988
I'm thinking about Chicago
and Fosse

594
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,623
and all I can think about
is like a voice,

595
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,358
like... [gangster accent]
oh, we gotta make someone

596
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,427
who's nice and cutthroat, see?

597
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,962
Have you seen Chicago before?

598
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,764
Oh, no. Yeah, I have.

599
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,499
The show?

600
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,467
No, the city.

601
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,569
Yeah, I've seen the show.
[all laugh]

602
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,172
We desperately need to start
on the choreography then.

603
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,607
-Yeah.
-Girls!

604
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,075
-Yes, ma'am?
-Girls!

605
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,176
Ladies.

606
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,477
Aah!

607
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,612
Stop!

608
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,946
Who here has done,
like, choreography

609
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:08,914
and stuff like that?

610
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,349
-I have.
-Okay.

611
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:13,452
Who here has done, like, musical
theater choreography, though?

612
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,020
When I was in middle school.
Does that count, bitch?

613
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,790
What were you, apple tree
number three on the side?

614
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,159
Just like... [humming]

615
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,695
[all laugh]

616
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:27,399
Does everyone know who Fosse was
and what Fosse is all about?

617
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,702
I mean, I wouldn't say
I know what he's all about.

618
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,705
I'm a little nervous,
because I'm asking these girls

619
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,206
if they know anything
about Fosse,

620
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:38,911
and they're just looking at me
like I got six heads.

621
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,514
The only concern I have
is bringing the Fosse to life.

622
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,651
He's all about details
and being super clean.

623
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,985
Okay, choreographer.

624
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,687
I'm not--
I'm not doing any of that.

625
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:51,623
Well, Sherry, you seem like
you have the most knowledge.

626
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,525
So you're the choreographer.
[laughs]

627
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,227
But I'm certainly no dancer.

628
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,662
Does anybody feel good

629
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,297
about kind of spearheading
the choreography?

630
00:24:58,297 --> 00:24:59,431
I teach a dance class,

631
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,699
but I learn
other people's choreography

632
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,067
and then teach that.

633
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,870
But I know about formations
and I know about dancing.

634
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,005
I mean, I would say Rock.

635
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,274
I would actually say Rock.

636
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,509
I'll spearhead it
if you help edit me.

637
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,643
Okay.

638
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,878
Yeah, you could be
the dramaturge.

639
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,514
And then does anybody know
the style, like, Fosse?

640
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,615
Well, some of the iconic moments

641
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,550
come from the silhouettes
of the dancers.

642
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,686
Totally.

643
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,454
Like very clean, artistic poses.

644
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,823
It's all about
those formations, right?

645
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,526
Like what is it--
a Fosse amoeba or whatever,

646
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,161
when they, like--when you move,
like, across the stage,

647
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,362
like, all together,

648
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,563
but you're all, like,
doing different stuff?

649
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,598
Yeah.

650
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,833
It was so controlled
and amazing.

651
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,503
I mean, I think it's like cute
to make sure that that's there,

652
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:38,837
but at the end of the day,

653
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,873
like, we are doing
our own rendition of it.

654
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,608
We don't wanna, like,
purposely make anybody look bad,

655
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,076
you know what I mean?

656
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,177
I guess we need to decide, like,

657
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:47,980
do we really wanna
stick to the Fosse style

658
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,314
and make sure that
that is the thing

659
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,417
that we put at the forefront?

660
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:54,153
The last thing we wanna do is
come out like Broadway babies.

661
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,255
We wanna make sure, like,
everybody's comfortable.

662
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:57,389
What?

663
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,425
Of course it needs
to be a Fosse number.

664
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,059
Oh, my God.

665
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,561
This is a Fosse challenge.

666
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,830
Have I taken crazy pills?

667
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,132
Have I lost my mind?

668
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,901
No, you've lost your damn mind.

669
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,069
Oh, God.

670
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,641
[chatter]act 4

671
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:17,576
-I'm real excited.
-Oh, my God.

672
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,678
The time has come for us
to learn some choreography

673
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,747
for our main stage
Fosse-inspired number.

674
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,048
This is huge.

675
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,683
This is major, actually.

676
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,819
We have to choreograph
this number ourselves,

677
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,720
and this is day one.

678
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,889
We just met each other
three seconds ago.

679
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,992
Okay, I think
for the Fosse style,

680
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,161
we should start off,
like, silhouetted first.

681
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,296
Cute.

682
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:40,132
So very dynamic shapes
and levels.

683
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:44,369
I'm thinking high to low:
high levels, medium levels,

684
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,538
and then the two in the front
are gonna be low and high.

685
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,274
I want to make these bitches
look fierce.

686
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,376
I want whoever
the other girls are

687
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:55,414
to know that our group
is going to kick their asses.

688
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,316
Every time we do a new pose,

689
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,717
I think we should
change the levels.

690
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,285
So if you're low, go high.

691
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,654
So I feel like
that's gonna be a lot.

692
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,990
But it's only, like,
two or three.

693
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,292
Okay. Okay. Good.

694
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,994
Because
that just confused me.

695
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,898
I am very concerned, because I
know that learning choreography

696
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,299
is not my strongest suit.

697
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,469
So we don't have to really
produce a Broadway production,

698
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,238
because we don't have
that much time,

699
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,672
and sometimes
that can take years.

700
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,175
All right, hit your high poses.

701
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,010
Hit your medium poses.

702
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,380
Aiden, that looks too kung fu.

703
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,082
Go for Fosse.

704
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,417
Because you're like a crazy
Fosse character, so be like...

705
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,922
I am a horror queen,
not a Fosse queen.

706
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,458
Can we do
one of those Fosse blobs,

707
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,860
where we all huddle like this

708
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,429
and she has us
to work off of, like a shelf.

709
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,365
I don't get it.

710
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,767
I repeat. I'm not a dancer.

711
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:53,272
I'm thinking, like, we need
to incorporate this move,

712
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,742
and I'm wondering if we do this
to start out the first verse,

713
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:59,745
so it's... ♪ bah-bah-dun-dun ♪

714
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,213
♪ Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun ♪

715
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,414
Pose.

716
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,716
Okay, so that
is significantly easier

717
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,152
for everybody who is "high,"

718
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,154
not for somebody
who is down here.

719
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,556
That's what I was trying to say,

720
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:11,557
because I'm like, I don't want
nobody, like, struggling.

721
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:12,491
Let's try one more time and see.

722
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,725
Yeah, let's just
figure it out.

723
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,927
Because we need to get off
the beginning, yeah.

724
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,395
This is taking too long.

725
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,798
♪ We're running out of time ♪

726
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,235
Jaida feels like
we are wasting time

727
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,404
trying to do little details.

728
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,272
But at the same token,

729
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,508
we can't be basic bitches
doing a box step.

730
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,876
It has to be good.

731
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,377
Here, I have an idea.

732
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,882
So pose, melt, pose, pivot,

733
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:40,118
turn, walk to a spot,
and hit it.

734
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,787
-I like that.
-Okay, then let's do that.

735
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,055
Baby, we done wasted
a lot of time.

736
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,692
Stressful.

737
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:47,859
Yeah.

738
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,361
I'm getting a little frustrated

739
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,630
because it's really hard
to learn the choreography

740
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,298
when it's always changing.

741
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:54,600
Bitch, let's do this
and get it moving.

742
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,936
I have--
I have a really crazy idea.

743
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:00,806
Because
this is just the beginning.

744
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,474
-We gotta get this done.
-Okay.

745
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,675
I think we should just do

746
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:08,380
a good, old-fashioned
click, click, unh, unh.

747
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,284
And it's mean,
you're mad, you're angry.

748
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,586
Keep it simple and detailed.
That's what Fosse's all about.

749
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,155
Not about doing, like,
ooh, ah, ee, pblblbl.

750
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,557
That's what I've been saying.

751
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,726
I definitely feel like maybe
my opinions are not valued.

752
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,628
Oh!

753
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,062
-Let's--let's--
-From the beginning,

754
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,530
I said we should have did
something simple. Didn't listen.

755
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,698
Then now we stuck here.

756
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,234
The simplicity is now,
like, out of the window.

757
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,169
Like, it doesn't really matter
if it's simple

758
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,772
if people did not catch
where they should be

759
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,007
when they should be.

760
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:36,408
Do you not feel like
you know the transitions?

761
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,643
-Not really, no.
-Me, neither.

762
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:40,379
Dude, like, it's really
just walking and blocking.

763
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,748
If you're used to doing that,
then it's walking and blocking.

764
00:29:42,748 --> 00:29:44,182
But if you're not used
to walking and blocking,

765
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,751
baby, it's gonna been--

766
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:48,220
But it would have been that
either way.

767
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,122
Either we would have had
all the time

768
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,124
and it would have been
walking and blocking--

769
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,326
But the thing that I'm saying
is if we walk and blocked

770
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,194
when we had time
to walk and block,

771
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,562
then people would have had time

772
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,431
to learn where we were walking
and blocking to.

773
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,866
But you're not really
contributing that much

774
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:01,867
to what we were trying to do.

775
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,168
From the beginning,

776
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,237
I said we do not need
to produce a Broadway show.

777
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:08,206
I said we need to make sure
it's nice and simple.

778
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,941
You saw that I had offered
advice several times.

779
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,577
I even said, like, hey,
is anybody listening to me?

780
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:13,879
You said simplify it,
but what does that mean?

781
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:16,214
I said simplify,
and I offered advice.

782
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,283
Girl, shut the fuck up.
Everybody stop arguing.

783
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,752
We're just going in circles.

784
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,254
It's making me
so fucking nervous,

785
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:24,923
I am like on the verge of tears
at this point.

786
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,659
Are we doing a last run or--

787
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,661
No, we're done.
We don't have time.

788
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,296
Well, all right.

789
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,765
All the time
has been spent arguing.

790
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:35,367
What are we going to do now?

791
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,568
We're all
just gonna stand around

792
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,637
and be like...
♪ You don't know me ♪

793
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,572
♪ Dah-dah-dah-dah ♪

794
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,209
♪ I don't have any choreo,
yeah ♪

795
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:45,544
So--

796
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,480
Oh, my goodness,
we're gonna fail this so hard.

797
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,017
I feel bad because I feel like
I'm responsible for this.

798
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,085
[whispers] Sorry, guys.

799
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,886
I was put in charge,

800
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,724
and I basically
sent everyone off a cliff.

801
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,760
Listen, we're all actors here.

802
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,794
Even if you don't claim
to be an actor,

803
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:03,795
you are an actor.

804
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,796
You're a drag queen.

805
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,465
So sell it,

806
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,600
even if you don't know
what you're doing.

807
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,869
It's time to buckle up
and get ready.

808
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,605
I do not know what's gonna
happen on the main stage

809
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:14,706
after this rehearsal.

810
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,641
Are you gonna complain about it

811
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,344
or are you gonna rise to
the occasion and figure it out?

812
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,213
Ooh, bitch.

813
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,917
Whoo!act 5

814
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,253
First time
there's boys in the
workroom.check

815
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,654
Our very first maxi-challenge

816
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,757
is to perform
in a Fosse-esque number

817
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,258
called You Don't Know Me.

818
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,527
And today, we have to perform it
in front of the judges.

819
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:38,964
It's all in the bag.

820
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,832
I don't know if the girls
are gonna be able to bounce back

821
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,400
from that rehearsal that we had,

822
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,604
but I believe in myself to be
able to deliver a performance.

823
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,072
I'm gonna be fine.

824
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,341
Last night I was really nervous,

825
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,510
but the thing about it is
is that I'm a professional,

826
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,445
and, bitch, I'm gonna
make it work and turn it out.

827
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:54,846
Is anybody nervous?

828
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,516
We didn't end too cute
on our rehearsal.

829
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,917
Staying up all night in my room,

830
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,254
every commercial that came on,
putting my headphones in.

831
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,489
I'm nervous for all of y'all
except me.

832
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,458
[all laugh]

833
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:10,028
Listen, as long as Jaida
doesn't scream at me anymore,

834
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,930
we'll be fine.

835
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,231
And I'm here for that, bitch.

836
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,200
-Aah!
-Okay.

837
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,469
[bleep] her highness.
[all laugh]Sis.check

838
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:23,942
I feel like I need
to let the whole room know

839
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,745
why I've been shutting down
a little bit.

840
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:29,815
I learned a lot about myself
during rehearsal.

841
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,750
I have a whole bunch
of triggers,

842
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,954
but I, like, kind of feel
kind of odd in leadership roles.

843
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,955
Yeah.

844
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,790
I never wanna be
put into a position

845
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,793
where I lead someone
to feeling bad.

846
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,295
A big thing
when I was growing up

847
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:46,698
was my mother
was addicted to meth.

848
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,601
And she was, like,
completely addicted to drugs.

849
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,437
She took me aside
a couple times,

850
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,541
and she would say, "I'm addicted
to drugs because of you."

851
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,812
"Because..." [sobs]

852
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,449
"Because of you, because
of you kids, I'm doing drugs."

853
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,952
And I didn't realize it
until yesterday

854
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,053
that I have these triggers.

855
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:10,255
When I feel responsible
for other people,

856
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,757
it kind of puts me in a...

857
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,626
it puts me in a dark place.

858
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,463
That always stuck with me,

859
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:21,299
because when you love someone
so much

860
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,500
and they tell you

861
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,938
that you're the reason
for their unhappiness,

862
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:29,007
it'll mess with you a bit.

863
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,042
Honestly,
you are not responsible

864
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,044
for anybody else's,
like, baggage.

865
00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:34,546
Like, in life,

866
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,815
you are only responsible
for your own actions.

867
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,718
Like, what anybody else does
is not on you.

868
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:43,655
Remember to make sure you take
care of yourself first, always.

869
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:46,324
And, Rock,
you have us now, bitch.

870
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:48,593
This is new beginnings
for all of us.

871
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,329
If anything, yesterday I was
more offended by your farts.

872
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,164
Those are what you should
have apologized for,

873
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,332
but you did not, bitch.

874
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:55,333
There's more coming.

875
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,769
These girls are starting
to understand me

876
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,971
a little bit better
than I can understand myself,

877
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,340
and they really care for me,

878
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,808
even though we haven't
known each other for very long.

879
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,177
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

880
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,313
Get shorts that are a little bit
longer next time, okay?

881
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,314
And walk like this?

882
00:34:09,314 --> 00:34:10,949
Oh, my God!

883
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,684
[screaming and laughter]
Girl!

884
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,552
She brought
her cookie-cutters, baby.

885
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,488
Oh, my God.

886
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,558
I'm so excited,
because my first number

887
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,093
that I did
in New York City in drag

888
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,628
was based around Chicago.

889
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:24,896
Oh, word.

890
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,765
And so I'm like
this is so serendipitous.

891
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,968
Like, all right, bitch, you're
in the right spot, let's do it!

892
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:31,569
[laughs]

893
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,471
See, you have, like,
so much character to you.

894
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:35,206
-You're so bubbly, and just--
-Thank you.

895
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,274
I like to think
that I'm just a cheerleader

896
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,643
on too many caffeine pills,

897
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,246
like the bitch
from Saved By the Bell

898
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,447
who's so excited.

899
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,349
Like, that's me.

900
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,053
I'm a little concerned right now
for Aiden

901
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:52,324
because Aiden was so in her head
in rehearsal about the dancing.

902
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,892
-Aiden.
-Yeah?

903
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,528
How art thou feeling?

904
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,130
I know you were, yesterday,
feeling like a little--

905
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,533
I was literally on the verge
of tears yesterday

906
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:03,068
at the end of rehearsal.

907
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,703
I hope that wasn't my fault.

908
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,639
It wasn't that it was
anybody's fault, exactly.

909
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,941
I know how you were feeling,

910
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,611
and I would never want you
to feel like that, so--

911
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,780
You have to shake all that off

912
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,751
and just leave everything
on the stage and just kill it.

913
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,019
We gonna go out there,

914
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,788
and we gonna be giving them
some Fosse realness.

1039
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,605
[all laugh]

1040
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,873
RuPaul: Jaida Essence Hall.

1041
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,609
Michelle: Would you
pull that crap with Annette?

1042
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,678
[all laugh]

1043
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,313
Jaida: I'm ready
to show the judges

1044
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:57,615
exactly how elegant I can be.

1045
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,118
I feel like a big, yellow,
floaty cupcake

1046
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,486
coming down the runway.

1047
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:04,555
Light, airy, and I have
these sickening shoulders

1048
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,524
to accentuate the whole look
and tie it together.

1049
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,526
Ross: Butter?
I hardly know her.

1050
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,328
Michelle: Very good, Ross.

1051
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,296
Yell-err.

1052
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,500
[all laugh]

1053
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,970
RuPaul: Jan. Simply Jan.

1054
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,738
Ross:
Well, she wore her tulle-belt.

1055
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,341
Thandie: She did doubles.
It's a double entendre.

1056
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,077
Michelle: No,
it's a double en-tulle-dre.

1057
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:29,747
Jan: I am bringing the T-O-O-L
to the T-U-L-L-E,

1058
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:31,983
and I'm giving you
a fashion-forward silhouette.

1059
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,351
I want to do things

1060
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,087
that other people
aren't going to think of doing.

1061
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,555
It's a win.

1062
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,990
Ross: Oh.

1063
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,491
Well, that throws
a wrench in my plan.

1064
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,859
[laughs]

1065
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,662
Ross: This is embarrassing,
but I can see her manhole.

1066
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:46,230
Michelle: Oh, no!

1067
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,167
RuPaul: Rock M. Sakura.

1068
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,469
Oh, tulle's out for summer.

1069
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,906
Michelle:
She's acting quite a-loofah.

1070
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,808
Rock: They told me
to do a tulle runway,

1071
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,142
I'm gonna do a tulle runway.

1072
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,278
I'm wearing
800 to 900 yards of tulle.

1073
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:04,649
I have dynamic silhouettes
and big ideas.

1074
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,417
Michelle:
Welcome to the netting zoo.

1075
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,820
Robyn: She's a fluffer.

1076
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,521
[all laugh]

1077
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,523
RuPaul: Sherry Pie.

1078
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,258
Michelle: Oh, no!

1079
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,261
RuPaul: Somebody left Sherry Pie
in the rain.

1080
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,663
Michelle: Aw.

1081
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:22,834
Sherry: I'm just crying
my big bum down the runway.

1082
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,603
I just feel like
a little cumulo-nimbus cutie.

1083
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,539
It's campy, it's clever,

1084
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:31,876
it's just kind of whimsical
in the best way.

1085
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,512
Ross: Does she remind
anyone else of Stormy Daniels?

1086
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:36,347
[all laugh]

1087
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:37,882
This is what global warming
looks like.

1088
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:40,151
Yeah.
[all laugh]

1089
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,089
RuPaul: Welcome, ladies.act 7

1090
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,958
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1091
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,361
starting with Aiden Zhane.

1092
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,596
Hi.

1093
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:53,865
In the fashion show,
you were a sunflower.

1094
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,166
It was very, very cute.

1095
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:58,669
You managed to keep things
campy and fashion,

1096
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,506
which is a difficult line
to balance.

1097
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:04,575
And then your other look
was very Thanksgiving-y.

1098
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:05,710
Yes.

1099
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,345
The centerpiece of a table,
perhaps.

1100
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:09,614
You had a very meaty tuck.

1101
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,349
It could use some work.

1102
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,050
-Do you know that already?
-Yes.

1103
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,320
Listen, a little duct tape
will fix all those things.

1104
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,822
[all laugh]

1105
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:22,660
That dress is making my body
talk part one, two, and three.

1106
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,861
[all laugh]

1107
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,364
There's a kind of
Grey Gardens vibe.

1108
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,733
I'm a little frightened,
but fascinated.

1109
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,601
Right out the box
I was really impressed

1110
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,637
with what I saw
in that performance.

1111
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:34,071
It was very Sally Bowles.

1112
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,908
It was a great, great lip sync.

1113
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:38,943
Your lyrics say that
you have multiple personalities.

1114
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,111
Well, honey, I cannot wait

1115
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,713
to see who walks
around that corner next week.

1116
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,181
Thank you.

1117
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,450
Up next, Dahlia Sin.

1118
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:47,952
In your fashion show,

1119
00:44:47,952 --> 00:44:52,290
you gave us the fabulous
neon green with the red hair.

1120
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,991
That was a really great pairing.

1121
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,828
I loved your
Sissy That Sasquatch fur number.

1122
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:00,264
I thought that was so fun.

1123
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:01,832
This red is so gorgeous on you.

1124
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:04,802
I just wanna make sure that
you are painting loud enough.

1125
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:05,870
Okay.

1126
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,738
Remember,
nothing's subtle in drag.

1127
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:08,773
Okay.

1128
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,608
You've gotta pop
like you're Soju

1129
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:11,609
in the first week.

1130
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:14,078
[laughs]

1131
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,446
Eew.

1132
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,115
In your performance tonight,

1133
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,484
you felt a little nervous to me.

1134
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,919
I could feel a little bit
of holy shit.

1135
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,121
-Mm-hmm.
-Did you grow up in Vegas?

1136
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,925
Because in your lyrics, you said
"a big city with lots of sin."

1137
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:29,393
Brooklyn.

1138
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,395
[all laugh]

1139
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,496
You've won titles?

1140
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,400
What are those titles?

1141
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,370
Mostly just, you know, being
on the train, being a whore.

1142
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,571
Those are more my titles.

1143
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,340
-Uh-huh.
-That's it.

1144
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,575
So what I'm saying is I
didn't get to know much of you,

1145
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,245
and I'd like to get to know you
a little bit more.

1146
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,846
-I got you.
-Okay.

1147
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,983
Up next, Jaida Essence Hall.

1148
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,584
Any relationship to Arsenio?

1149
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,886
Not yet.
[all laugh]

1150
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:58,356
Yes, it's Jaida,
the essence of beauty,

1151
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:01,225
the gowns, the face,
and all that booty.

1152
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,928
Those lyrics were spot-on.

1153
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,863
Like, I learned
so much about you.

1154
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:09,066
What I felt when I watched you
lip sync was your playfulness.

1155
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,969
You have that way of moving
that feels very, very natural.

1156
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,771
It made me really happy.

1157
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,839
It made me smile.

1158
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:15,806
Thank you.

1159
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:16,841
In the fashion show,

1160
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,709
I specifically loved
the Fall look.

1161
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:20,277
I thought that
was super-duper chic.

1162
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,512
But at the end of the day,

1163
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,547
the confidence
would have sold any garment.

1164
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:25,116
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

1165
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:26,283
What a delight.
Just beautiful.

1166
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,819
You remind me of
a Bollywood princess, and...

1167
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,121
Ooh.

1168
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,489
And Josephine Baker
all combined.

1169
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,691
-Thank you.
-I love the tone of that yellow,

1170
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,160
and I love that you chose
the pink nails with it,

1171
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,628
because it looks like
you'd wear it

1172
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,363
to the gayest Easter ever.

1173
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,464
[all laugh]

1174
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,966
Thank you.

1175
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,435
Up next, simply Jan.

1176
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:45,503
Just Jan.

1177
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,104
This tulle look
was really smart,

1178
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,173
because you knew
that everybody was gonna come

1179
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:51,008
in these frou-frou
Vera Wang numbers,

1180
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,844
and it was smart
to do something different.

1181
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,479
It was smart
to pull out the tool.

1182
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,049
You have a lot of skills
in your tulle-belt.

1183
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,917
[all laugh]

1184
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,019
You've got frigging
traffic cone earrings.

1185
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,888
-I mean, come on.
-Ooh. [laughs]

1186
00:47:03,888 --> 00:47:05,322
You're a feast.

1187
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,725
I just really, really wanna
pay attention to the details.

1188
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:09,093
This is my favorite show.

1189
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:11,996
I listen to the critiques,
and I wanna apply them to myself

1190
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,431
every time I step on the runway.

1191
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,666
And it needs to be different
every single time.

1192
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,768
And you did all of that
the first time we saw you.

1193
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:18,969
Yeah.

1194
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,938
When you were out
doing the lip sync number,

1195
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,974
I felt Demi Moore
in the height of her heyday,

1196
00:47:23,974 --> 00:47:24,975
this ambition.

1197
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,310
Even in your lyrics, you say,

1198
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:29,547
"push further into mainstream
than any queen before."

1199
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,450
Hmm. I have a little issue
with that.

1200
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,686
[all laugh]

1201
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,455
You have a lot
on your to-do list.

1202
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:38,456
I do.

1203
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:40,191
-One thing at a time.
-Yes.

1204
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:41,926
-Show us who you are.
-Yes.

1205
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,528
-But don't try to do too much.
-Yes, thank you.

1206
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,996
Up next, Rock M. Sakura.

1207
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,865
Hi, hi.

1208
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,334
Let's talk about
your fashion runway looks.

1209
00:47:50,334 --> 00:47:54,438
The first one, you came out with
the anime-loving Spring look.

1210
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,774
I drew the illustration
that was on the side.

1211
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,943
-Oh, you drew them?
-Yes.

1212
00:47:58,943 --> 00:48:00,611
It's anime on acid.
It's amazing.

1213
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:03,247
Your performance
was very interesting,

1214
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,449
because you did
kind of 1920s, see,

1215
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:09,487
and then you went into scat
and... fart humor, yeah?

1216
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,021
Yeah.

1217
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:14,291
-Because is that--
-Yeah, that's part of me.

1218
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,660
At least, like, 10 times
in the workroom, I've farted.

1219
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,829
These poor ladies had
to keep reapplying their makeup.

1220
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:20,231
It kept melting off.

1221
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,599
You said,
"A high kick to a fart

1222
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,468
that can send a grown man
back home to his mama."

1223
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:25,469
That's right.

1224
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,138
That's always the sign for me

1225
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,006
of someone who has something
important to say.

1226
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,375
It's true, yeah.
[all laugh]

1227
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,043
This look tonight,
you sort of remind me

1228
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:35,713
of any guy who goes on a date
with Michelle Visage:

1229
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:37,148
you are getting swallowed.

1230
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,383
[all laugh]

1231
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:40,584
Can't even argue that.

1232
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,520
[all laugh]

1233
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,921
It's a lot.

1234
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,457
I would love to just edit
everything down just a skosh.

1235
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:47,992
I love this outfit.

1236
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:50,628
I love how huge
and ostentatious it is,

1237
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,096
and the same with your makeup.

1238
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,598
It's performance art, it's not
trying to just be beautiful.

1239
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,233
So you go for it.

1240
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:59,804
All right, up next, cut me
a piece of that Sherry Pie.

1241
00:48:59,804 --> 00:49:02,473
I love a queen
that can make me laugh,

1242
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:04,875
and your lyrics
made me laugh right away.

1243
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,444
POV, OMG, and LOL.

1244
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,413
[all laugh]

1245
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:13,117
If Meryl Streep could be
a drag queen, it would be you.

1246
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,586
It would.
There's something there.

1247
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,055
In the fashion show,
the first look was lovely.

1248
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,691
You know, it wasn't dynamic,
but it was beautiful.

1249
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,294
Then she turned around and
came out as Zorro the Gay Blade.

1250
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,361
[all laugh]

1251
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,563
I loved everything about it.

1252
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,565
It told us a little bit more
of who you are.

1253
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,901
Your dress is amazing, because
it does something when you move

1254
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:34,505
that is really pleasant
to look at. Yeah.

1255
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,740
[all laugh]
Thank you.

1256
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,741
Thank you, ladies.

1257
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,443
I think we've heard enough.

1258
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:42,713
Now, while you untuck backstage,

1259
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,149
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1260
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:49,253
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

1261
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:50,254
what do you think?

1262
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:51,956
Aiden Zhane.

1263
00:49:51,956 --> 00:49:53,657
I think Aiden knows
that she is different,

1264
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,292
and that that's a cool thing.

1265
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,460
The lip sync was great,

1266
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,095
but it was also
how she was telling the story.

1267
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,296
It was almost
listening to, like,

1268
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,332
a children's book
being read or something.

1269
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,234
She defines originality.

1270
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,569
Ross: Aiden is a natural.

1271
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:08,072
Watch out for her.
She is so memorable.

1272
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:10,741
She's got something,
and it's important for her

1273
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,943
to fine-tune whatever it is
that is.

1274
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,478
Mm-hmm.

1275
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,146
Dahlia Sin.

1276
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,750
This is a beautiful girl
who knows how to walk a runway

1277
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,452
and who knows how to put
a look together as well.

1278
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,687
Dahlia is beautiful,
Dahlia is sexy,

1279
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,057
but Dahlia tries to be sexy.

1280
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:31,228
Because I'm not 100% sure
Dahlia knows who she is yet.

1281
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:32,496
Mm-hmm.

1282
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,831
I feel like
she's limiting herself

1283
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:35,032
to just thinking
about the aesthetics.

1284
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,101
-Mm-hmm.
-And I think that sometimes,

1285
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:41,138
when you're kind of hemmed in
by what your aesthetic value is,

1286
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,574
you know, looking gorgeous,
it makes you a little stiff.

1287
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:46,310
RuPaul: Jaida Essence Hall.

1288
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,679
Jaida Essence Hall
Pinkett Smith.

1289
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,514
[laughs] Zeta Jones.

1290
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:51,649
Zeta Jones.

1291
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:56,153
She is just
so much fun to watch.

1292
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,657
She makes me feel like
I want to also get up and dance,

1293
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,025
which is very special.

1294
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:04,428
I was a little concerned,
because Jaida has so much poise

1295
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,297
that she wouldn't
be able to let go

1296
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,565
and kind of get dirty
and have fun.

1297
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,802
But that lip sync
showed me she was down.

1298
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:12,803
Jan.

1299
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,638
Ooh, Jan wants to win.

1300
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,908
I think Jan wants my seat.

1301
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,109
-Yes, she does.
-I think you're right.

1302
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,377
Jan pulled out all the stops

1303
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:21,645
to say, I can do this,
I can do this, I can do--

1304
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,548
It was like her résumé,
which I can't blame her for.

1305
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,583
I actually kind of loved
that she did all that.

1306
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,519
She was a wonderful performer,

1307
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,888
and hitting
that great high note.

1308
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:35,359
The positive energy
was so apparent, strong,

1309
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,195
and then also a lot.

1310
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,863
A lot at the same time.

1311
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,665
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

1312
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,201
She's got so many things
going around in her head

1313
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,170
that maybe she's not
being present enough

1314
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:48,672
to focus on
what's happening right now.

1315
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,174
Rock M. Sakura.

1316
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,942
I loved Rock M.'s spring look,

1317
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,111
especially when I found out
that she drew it herself.

1318
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,981
That, to me, took it
to this whole other level

1319
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:58,949
of, okay, this girl's
got something to say.

1320
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,851
Her performance was good.

1321
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:04,121
Um... Fart humor
makes everybody laugh.

1322
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,422
I just don't know
if it was the first thing

1323
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:06,590
she should come out with.

1324
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,891
Tonight on the runway,

1325
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:10,494
I actually liked that
tulle dress that she had on.

1326
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:11,929
It's a very smartly
constructed outfit,

1327
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:13,764
because she did have a waist.

1328
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,366
Michelle, I have to disagree
with you. I just--

1329
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,101
Her whole body was shaped out.

1330
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,102
What you talking about, Ross?

1331
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:19,269
This is the challenge

1332
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:20,537
where you're supposed
to show us who you are.

1333
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,672
I couldn't even see her,

1334
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:24,608
let alone Sherry Pie
standing behind her.

1335
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,344
[laughs]

1336
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,379
Sherry Pie.

1337
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:30,280
I live for this kind of queen.

1338
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,482
I mean, this is
the kind of queen

1339
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,550
where you're using the urinal
and you look up,

1340
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,219
and there's a flyer
for her face up on the wall,

1341
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,920
and you go, "Oh, hey,
what are you doing tomorrow?

1342
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,389
She's performing." I mean--

1343
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:40,991
Wait, who are you
talking to at the urinal?

1344
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,092
Who am I not talking to
at the urinal?

1345
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,361
That's the easier question.

1346
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:46,330
Her performance
was so fantastic.

1347
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:49,166
Every little nuance that
she could throw in, she did.

1348
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,367
Uh-huh.

1349
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,702
She's so excited
by what she does.

1350
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:55,305
There's a delightedness
in her eyes, and a sparkle.

1351
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,341
I'm really excited
to see what comes next.

1352
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,209
All right, silence.

1353
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,678
I've made my decision.

1354
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,381
Bring back my girls.

1355
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:07,017
RuPaul: Welcome back, ladies.act
8

1356
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,419
I've made some decisions.

1357
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:16,126
Jan, you're a sharp tool,
and, girl, you can belt.

1358
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,696
-You're safe.
-Thank you.

1359
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:22,933
Aiden Zhane.

1360
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,402
You have multiple personalities,

1361
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,572
and tonight,
all of them are safe.

1362
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:35,779
Rock M. Sakura.

1363
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,081
Your heart's in the right place,

1364
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:40,751
but you could have left
your fart in San Francisco.

1365
00:53:45,823 --> 00:53:47,224
You're safe.

1366
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,328
Thank you so much. [sobs]

1367
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:03,507
Dahlia Sin.

1368
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:05,342
Beauty is only skin deep.

1369
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:08,178
We want you to go deeper.

1370
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,948
You...

1371
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,917
are safe.

1372
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:19,723
You may join the other girls.

1373
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,091
Thank you.

1374
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:26,096
I'm confused.

1375
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,931
How did we end up in the bottom?

1376
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,201
Jaida Essence Hall,
Sherry Pie.

1377
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:35,105
I'm not sorry, my dears.

1378
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,312
Because you are
the top two queens of the week.

1379
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:45,048
[laughter and applause]

1380
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,650
Come on, yellow.

1381
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,418
Oh, my God.

1382
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,121
Nobody is going home this week.

1383
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,456
[cheering]
Yes!

1384
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,892
I'm like, yes!

1385
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:57,261
I'm so excited.

1386
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,697

[all laugh]

1388
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,336
There will be one winner.

1389
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:12,543
Two queens stand before me.

1390
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:13,877
Prior to tonight,

1391
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:17,447
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

1392
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,283
of Call Your
Squirrel Friend--

1393
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:22,986
I mean, Girlfriend, by Robyn.

1394
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,657
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1395
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:32,029
and win a cash prize of $5.000.

1396
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:33,797
-Mm.
-Ooh!

1397
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,899
-Oh, my God.
-Make it rain.

1398

[echoing] for your life!

1401
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:47,077
Sherry, girl, you cute,

1402
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:48,512
but, bitch,
I'm gonna get this money.

1403

if you can't love yourself,

1457
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,446
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

I am 100% getting a vibe

1469
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,688
that the girls
in the other group

1470
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:53,323
think that
they're better than us,

1471
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,559
and that's really cute.
But cute next to gorgeous,

1472
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,695
gorgeous is gonna,
you know, devour cute.

1473
00:59:58,695 --> 00:59:59,863
-Meh.
-Meh.

1474
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,798
Uh-oh.

Did these bitches just "meh" me?

1476
01:00:04,568 --> 01:00:06,470
I don't know
who these queens are,

1477
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,605
but I'm ready to show them
what I'm made of.

1478
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,874
There's too many bitches
in the workroom.

1479
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:13,977
We gonna send them home
like dominoes:

1480
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,278
one after the other.

RuPaul: Next time,
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

1482
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:37,234
So far, you've all been safe
from elimination.

1483
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:39,135
That's about to change.

1484
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,540

I loved what you did
on the runway.

01:00:55,285 --> 01:00:58,188
I would love if you could merge
your beautiful art that you do
