RuPaul: Previously,
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.976
You need to create a product

3
00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:12.145
for a new Drag Queen
lifestyle brand Droop.

4
00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.146
Action.

5
00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.482
-The Magic Mullet!

6
00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:17.351
-Aah!
-[laughs]

7
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:20.354
It's the high energy,
high-belting bitch

8
00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.622

9
00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.190

10
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.925

very intense right now.

11

Widow Von'Du.

12
00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.030
I needed
a whole lot more funny.

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.866
-Jan.
-It started at 100,

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.335
and stayed there the whole time.

15
00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.970
-Heidi.
-It was so funny

16
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.305
and so much fun to watch.

17
00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:39.606
Con-drag-ulations.

18
00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:41.008
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

19
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.509
[applause]

20
00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.412
Widow Von'Du,
shantay you stay.

21
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.682
Jan, sashay away.mirror

22
00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.295
Oh, shit.

23
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:03.764
Child. Oh, Jesus.

24
00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.299
Children, children, children.

25
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.501
Well, there you have it.

26
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.003
Jan has been eliminated
from the competition,

27
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.438
and this is hard.

28
00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.440
But I said it before.

29
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.675
It's, like, if I have to
lip sync for my life,

30
00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:15.943
that bitch better be ready

31
00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.511
to go back to wherever
the fuck she came from.

32
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.213
"Stay humble, grateful,

33
00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:23.050
and remember, you're on
RuPaul's Drag Race."

34
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.651
-Oh.
-[laughs]

35
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.287
To be here was I know
a dream come true for her.

36
00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.622
Every day was a bliss to her.

37
00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:30.824
She was always so happy
and chipper.

38
00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.126
I'm, like, girl,
why you so happy every day?

39
00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.062
Especially early in the morning.

40
00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.196
Early in the goddamn morning.

41
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:39.333
Whoo! Yeah!
We're gonna do it, you guys!

42
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.001
We're on Drag Race!
How fun!

43
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:42.002
Yes!

44
00:01:42.002 --> 00:01:45.272
If a robot and a Barbie

45
00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.674
and a cheerleader
all had, like, an orgy,

46
00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.010
and then, like, they made
a robot cheerleader baby, bitch,

47
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.012
that would be Jan.

48
00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:55.148
I want to congratulate
your country ass...

49
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.351
-Way to go, baby,
-Thank you.

50
00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.785
...on winning
your first challenge.

51
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.921
Now, bitch, you can no longer
say you ain't got no money.

52
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.589
She can afford stuff now.

53
00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.757
You are now a thousand-aire.

54
00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.293
Oh, bitch,
I got money now, honey.

55
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.928
Oh, my bank account
went from 33 cents

56
00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:10.597
to $5.000.33. Oh!

57
00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.734
How are you feeling, Miss Goode?

58
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:15.235
Um, I don't know.

59
00:02:15.235 --> 00:02:19.406
I feel like I went from a 10
to a 1 real quick,

60
00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:21.141
and I think it was because

61
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.409
I definitely
went into this challenge,

62
00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.611
you know, being, like,
"I won the last challenge.

63
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:25.979
"I'm gonna win this one.

64
00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.715
I'm so excited."

65
00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.385
Gigi? Cocky?

66
00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:33.153
I would have never guessed.

67
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.523
[laughs]

68
00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:37.991
Sometimes you have
to learn the lesson,

69
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.126
like, trust your instincts

70
00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:41.561
and know that
whatever you decide to do,

71
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:43.096
you're just
gonna follow your mind.

72
00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:44.264
My daddy used to always tell us,

73
00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.066
he said, keep your ass right,
and your mind--

74
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.934
Keep your mind right
and your ass will follow.

75
00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.804
Keep your ass right
and your mind will follow.

76
00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.306
Hit the music.

77
00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.675
I needed my dream
to almost be crushed

78
00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.511
for me to realize
how important it is.

79
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:00.213
I was, like, if I don't
step this game up now, honey,

80
00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.315
there's not gonna be a game
to step up anymore.

81
00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:05.052
I got a new lease on life.

82
00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:07.687
I got another golden ticket
to be here.

83
00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:10.590

you were in the bottom.

don't know how cats react.

181
00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.114
Mrreow.

182
00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:56.249
But I'm gonna
give it to them. [laughs]

183
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.284
Do you like that ball?

184
00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:59.286
I usually play
with two at a time.

185
00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:02.155
-[laughs]
-Oh.

186
00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.659
Oh, you like to play rough,
don't you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy?

187
00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:06.960
-[hiss]
-Oh.

188
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.962
Hey, if you like that,

189
00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:11.164
there's a dot on the wall
right behind you.

190
00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.599
Get it, get it, get it!

191
00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:14.000
Get it! Oh! Oh!

192
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.403
Get it. Where'd it go?
Where'd it go?

193
00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:18.371
Oh, there it is! Get it!

194
00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.409
Oh, step right in.

195
00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:25.211
You're a cat-o-nine-tails,
aren't ya?

196
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.212
[hiss]

197
00:07:26.212 --> 00:07:27.614
Oh, you're gonna work the pole?

198
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:28.715
[groans] Oh!

199
00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:30.917
Don't ignore the ball.

200
00:07:32.018 --> 00:07:34.154
Oh, she's gonna punish
that ball.

201
00:07:34.154 --> 00:07:36.089
Whoo!

202
00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.958
Kitty cats
always land on their feet.

203
00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.427
Or pussy.

204
00:07:40.427 --> 00:07:41.795
[laughs]

205
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:44.898
Ooh, chic kitty.

206
00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.900
Ooh, that's nice and cool.

207
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.134
What are you doing
with the milk?

208
00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.969
It's a face masque, you see.

209
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.771
What's this?

210
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:53.306
That's a ball of yarn.

211
00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.141
An unfinished garment.

212
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:57.077
Yes.
[all laugh]

213
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:00.046
I seem to be stuck.

214
00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.915
-[laughs]
-Oh, no!

215
00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:05.785
Ladies, you were all
more convincing

216
00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:06.920
than the cast of Cats.

217
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.655
-Yes.
-Aw.

218
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.024
But one of you was purr-fect.

219
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:14.260
The winner of today's
mini-challenge is...

220
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.495
Jackie Cox.

221
00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.163
Yes!
[cheering]

222
00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:22.035
You've won a $2.500 gift card
from Fierce! Drag Jewels.

223
00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.270
-Ooh!
-Oh!

224
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.573
Okay, now, ladies, we are done
pussyfooting around.

225
00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:29.609
The upcoming election
is some serious business,

226
00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:34.481
and we at RuPaul's Drag Race
urge everyone to vote

227
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:38.618
so we can keep democracy
alive and well.

228
00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:43.490
However, to lift the spirits
of our candidates

229
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.026
and their
hardworking supporters,

230
00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.395
we'd like to provide
some comic relief.

231
00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:53.233
It's time for America's
first drag queen president!

232
00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:55.568
[cheering]

233
00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:56.870
For this week's maxi-challenge,

234
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.673
you'll be speaking at
Choices 2020.

235
00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.742
[all laugh]

236
00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:05.745
The most fabulous
presidential debate in herstory.

237
00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:09.149
Each of you
will present your platform

238
00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:12.819
and answer probing questions
from the free press.

239
00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:16.723
From tucking in public to
the right to bear breastplates,

240
00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.559
no drag issue is off the table.

241
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:22.829
Gentlemen, start
your campaign engines,

242
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:24.831
and may the best woman win.

243
00:09:24.831 --> 00:09:26.699
[cheering]end act

244
00:09:27.834 --> 00:09:30.670
Make sure you grab you
a good folder.

245
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.272
[whistles]
Sparkle folder.

246
00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:37.877
Today's maxi-challenge, we are
going to debate in Choices 2020.

247
00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.879
My understanding
of this challenge

248
00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:44.050
is to be funny
as a political--

249
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:46.486
politics--
a political politician.

250
00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:47.754
[laughs] Oh, God.

251
00:09:49.456 --> 00:09:51.524
I feel like, you know,
it's really important

252
00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:54.461
to incorporate
a lot of, like, drag slang.

253
00:09:54.461 --> 00:09:57.230
Like, you know, okurr.

254
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.701
But then still thinking
about political terms, like...

255
00:10:03.236 --> 00:10:04.404
Debate.

256
00:10:04.404 --> 00:10:07.240
Like debate or poll.

257
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.508
Senate.

258
00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:09.943
Campaign.

259
00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:10.977
Russian probe.

260
00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.480
[laughs]

261
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.048
Hello, candidates!

262
00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.349
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

263
00:10:16.349 --> 00:10:19.085
I brought my political advisor.

264
00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.653
Hi.

265
00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:23.289
[cheering]

266
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.924
Say hello to Raven.

267
00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:26.793
-Hi!
-Hi!

268
00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:30.563
She's here to help you put
the camp in your campaign.

269
00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:31.865
Fierce.

270
00:10:31.865 --> 00:10:33.333
Heidi.

271
00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:34.400
Hi!

272
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.135
-Meet Raven.
-Hi, Heidi.

273
00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.204
Nice. Such a womanly
handshake of yours, yes.

274
00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.039
Thank you.

275
00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.107
Hey, you won last week.

276
00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:42.742
-I did. Yay, Mama!
-How'd that feel?

277
00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.110
It felt amazing.

278
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.979
So what do you have?
Sell us.

279
00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:49.015
Well, I was going
for no more closets!

280
00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:50.950
-Ever!
-[laughs]

281
00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.287
Because you know, Heidi N Closet
came here as Heidi N Closet,

282
00:10:54.287 --> 00:10:56.089
and it just fell off so far.

283
00:10:56.089 --> 00:10:57.223
Yeah, you got my vote.

284
00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:59.125
-Yes!
-You got my vote.

285
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.460
With your win last week,

286
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.362
I could see
that you got in there

287
00:11:02.362 --> 00:11:03.730
and you started having fun.

288
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.532
You started taking your time
in places.

289
00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:07.400
And the whole thing was stupid,
and that's a gift.

290
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.635
That is a gift.

291
00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:10.770
It's the gap, honey.
The power of the gap, yes.

292
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.372
Ooh, well, there's your slogan
right there.

293
00:11:12.372 --> 00:11:13.873
Power. Oh, write it down.
Oh, wait, is that--

294
00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:16.476
There she go again.
[laughs]

295
00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:19.078
It's just the most obvious thing
in the world.

296
00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.346
I mean, come on.

297
00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:23.216
Fuck the GOP.
Get into the GAP.

298
00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:26.619
[all laugh]

299
00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:32.392
Now, can that be stolen
is the question.

300
00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:33.493
You can have it.

301
00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:35.328
Okay, here we go!

302
00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:36.596
-There it is.
-All right, bitch.

303
00:11:36.596 --> 00:11:38.398
We will see your ass
out there, okay?

304
00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:39.799
Okay, okay.

305
00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:42.936
-Bye.
-[laughs]

306
00:11:42.936 --> 00:11:44.771
Hi, Gigi Goode.

307
00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:46.806
So are you politically minded?

308
00:11:46.806 --> 00:11:47.874
I am gonna be honest.

309
00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:49.275
Politics and the economy

310
00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:50.910
have always been some things

311
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.379
that are rather terrifying
to me.

312
00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.681
-It's just--
-Terrifying why?

313
00:11:54.681 --> 00:11:56.849
I'm such an anxious person

314
00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:59.652
that sometimes it's really hard
to watch these debates

315
00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:02.255
and let things come in one ear
and stick in my brain

316
00:12:02.255 --> 00:12:03.756
and not let it go out the other.

317
00:12:03.756 --> 00:12:05.858
You don't want it
to come in one ear.

318
00:12:05.858 --> 00:12:07.493
You want it
to come on your tits.

319
00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:10.163
You know, politics is not
something to be afraid of.

320
00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:11.631
It's actually quite simple.

321
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:12.899
Do you have a platform?

322
00:12:12.899 --> 00:12:15.034
-How high?
-Yeah, exactly.

323
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:16.202
There's my answer.

324
00:12:16.202 --> 00:12:17.737
I know you think
in terms of fashion.

325
00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.739
If I were you, I would stick
with what you know.

326
00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.441
Okay. That changes everything.

327
00:12:21.441 --> 00:12:22.475
You didn't think of that?

328
00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:23.776
I don't know.

329
00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.178
Heidi Hydrates.

330
00:12:25.178 --> 00:12:27.413
-Oh!
-It's the obvious thing.

331
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.749
It's, like,
go with what you know.

332
00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:34.520
Now, Raven is a staunch
political strategist.

333
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.456
-I can see--
-That is why I'm here today.

334
00:12:36.456 --> 00:12:38.157
So patriotic.

335
00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:41.060
So is there anything
you'd like to ask Raven?

336
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.529
You know, I was in the bottom
last week,

337
00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:45.531
and I'm trying to claw my way
out of that this week.

338
00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:50.269
So I just wanna know how do you
bring yourself out of a rut?

339
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.472
-Don't take it seriously.
-Right.

340
00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:53.973
Make it stupid.

341
00:12:53.973 --> 00:12:55.908
-There you have it.
-Yeah, yeah.

342
00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:57.310
All right, see you at the polls.

343
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:58.311
-Good luck!
-Thank you, thank you.

344
00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:00.113
Okay.

345
00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.616
Oh...

346
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.052
Raven, let me introduce you
to the Widow.

347
00:13:06.052 --> 00:13:08.187
The Widow Von'Du.

348
00:13:08.187 --> 00:13:09.989
So this is
a make-or-break challenge,

349
00:13:09.989 --> 00:13:12.091
because last week
you were in the bottom.

350
00:13:12.091 --> 00:13:13.192
I was.

351
00:13:13.192 --> 00:13:14.927
But you fought your way
through the fire,

352
00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:17.664
and here you are
living to tell about it.

353
00:13:17.664 --> 00:13:19.365
Do you have a platform?

354
00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:21.167
I do not have a platform.

355
00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:22.168
Oh, bitch.

356
00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:23.202
I've seen your shoes.

357
00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:24.704
[laughs]
Oh, that's right.

358
00:13:24.704 --> 00:13:26.172
You don't have a platform.

359
00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:28.174
Now, do you have a prescription
to wear those shoes?

360
00:13:28.174 --> 00:13:30.476
[all laugh]

361
00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.978
Is that--
are they prescribed?

362
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:33.413
Poor child.

363
00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:34.947
How come you keep wearing
the biscuit baskets?

364
00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:37.250
Because sometimes I feel like
if I'm gonna be in the bottom,

365
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.918
I at least wanna be
in some shoes I can dance in.

366
00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:41.120
That's what keeps putting you
in the bottom, bitch.

367
00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.122
You're prepared
to be in the bottom.

368
00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:44.757
You won
the very first challenge.

369
00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:45.725
And I was dancing.

370
00:13:45.725 --> 00:13:47.093
And now you're scooting along.

371
00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.762
-In those biscuit baskets.
-In those biscuit baskets.

372
00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.131
If you had a platform,
what would it be?

373
00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:56.269
My biggest goal in life is to
show other large individuals

374
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:59.605
that you can love who you are
in the body that you're in.

375
00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.708
That's cute, but that's
not very funny, is it?

376
00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:03.876
I know that,
and that's what the thing is.

377
00:14:03.876 --> 00:14:06.145
You can make any issue funny.

378
00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.147
Trust me.
You're trying to become

379
00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.049
America's next drag superstar.

380
00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:12.085
Now, I don't know
what that's like.

381
00:14:12.085 --> 00:14:15.488
[laughs]

382
00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:19.625
But for me, when I competed,
I was too in here.

383
00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:22.762
Bitch, you ain't really
running for president.

384
00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:25.131
[all laugh]

385
00:14:25.131 --> 00:14:26.833
You know, listen,
the key to this competition

386
00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:30.536
is to be able to see yourself
from outside of yourself.

387
00:14:30.536 --> 00:14:32.171
And don't take it seriously.

388
00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:33.673
Don't take any of it seriously.

389
00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:35.575
I'm trying real hard

390
00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:39.779
to hide the fact
that having to now get prepared

391
00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.682
for another challenge
that's also funny,

392
00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:44.617
that it's not affecting me.

393
00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.720
I gotta find a way
to shake this shit off.end act

394
00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:53.626
Hi, Jaida.

395
00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:56.028
-Meet Raven.
-Hi, Raven.

396
00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.164
Now, this is a political
challenge here.

397
00:14:58.164 --> 00:15:01.434
Are you willing to sling some
mud to get your point across?

398
00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:03.536
I already know that I will be.

399
00:15:03.536 --> 00:15:05.738
-Okay. [laughs]
-For a fact.

400
00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:07.473
-Of course.
-She's so proper.

401
00:15:07.473 --> 00:15:10.143
-[laughs]
-She's very presidential.

402
00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:11.344
Yes, you are.

403
00:15:11.344 --> 00:15:13.479
A lot of people consider me
a pageant queen,

404
00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:15.081
and as anyone knows,

405
00:15:15.081 --> 00:15:16.883
a pageant queen
should always be prepared

406
00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.518
and you will do
whatever it takes to win.

407
00:15:18.518 --> 00:15:19.619
That's right.

408
00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:21.587
Have you ever been
in a debate before?

409
00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.922
No, I have not.

410
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:24.824
I find that hard to believe.

411
00:15:24.824 --> 00:15:25.925
Yeah, up in the club?

412
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.460
My thing is, I'm a real bitch.

413
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.995
I don't debate, I argue.

414
00:15:28.995 --> 00:15:30.730
Okay. [laughs]

415
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.665
Now, Jaida, make sure

416
00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:35.668
you're prepared
with what your platform is,

417
00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:37.436
knowing what your brand is,

418
00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.872
because that'll make it
easier for you to riff.

419
00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:42.542
I cannot wait
to see you out in the debate.

420
00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:43.676
-Get back to work.
-All right, thank you.

421
00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:46.012
-Okay.
-See you.

422
00:15:46.012 --> 00:15:50.249
J. Cox, I take you as someone
who is politically minded.

423
00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:53.219
I am. I've been donating to
political causes I believe in.

424
00:15:53.219 --> 00:15:55.755
I'm always watching cable news.
The good channels.

425
00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:57.657
Yeah, yes. Rachel Maddow.

426
00:15:57.657 --> 00:15:59.458
Love her.
Our boy Anderson, too.

427
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.560
Love him, too.

428
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.128
What about Cuomo?

429
00:16:02.128 --> 00:16:03.963
[all laugh]

430
00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.332
I mean, I've definitely
been very political,

431
00:16:06.332 --> 00:16:08.100
but I'm not registered
to vote, as I--

432
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.702
What? [stammers] What?

433
00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:12.038
I'm not an American.
I'm Canadian.

434
00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:13.339
So I'm here
on a green card.

435
00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:16.576
But I did see my mom go through
the citizenship process,

436
00:16:16.576 --> 00:16:18.311
and it was
really important for her

437
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:19.879
to be able have
that political voice.

438
00:16:19.879 --> 00:16:23.816
So this is your opportunity
to win a maxi-challenge.

439
00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.051
I haven't won one yet.

440
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:26.953
I'm surprised, actually,
that you haven't.

441
00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:28.888
-Oh, gosh, I need it, huh?
-Yeah.

442
00:16:28.888 --> 00:16:30.122
I think the big challenge for me

443
00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:32.291
will be keeping it
out of the literate

444
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.993
and just making it
a little more fun.

445
00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:35.494
-Yes.
-Keep it illiterate.

446
00:16:35.494 --> 00:16:37.864
-Yeah, illiterate's good, too.
-[laughs]

447
00:16:37.864 --> 00:16:40.299
A lot of you kids, you make it
so difficult, you know?

448
00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:42.201
You don't have to
reinvent the wheel.

449
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.904
The wheel is fine.
The wheel is fine.

450
00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:48.441
All right, J. Cox, we will see
you on the political circuit.

451
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:49.508
-Bye.
-Bye.

452
00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:50.910
Bye, guys.

453
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.879
-Crystal Methyd.
-Hello!

454
00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:54.213
Why, you old geezer.

455
00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:55.815
So this is the famous mullet.

456
00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:57.216
This is the mullet
that built an empire.

457
00:16:57.216 --> 00:16:59.785
Would you like a feel?

458
00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:00.920
[laughs]

459
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.089
Now, listen,
are you politically minded?

460
00:17:03.089 --> 00:17:05.091
I live in a really
conservative area,

461
00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:07.994
so just being myself
and dressing the way I do

462
00:17:07.994 --> 00:17:09.128
and walking around,

463
00:17:09.128 --> 00:17:11.030
I definitely make
political statements.

464
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.200
Drag is very political,
just like you said.

465
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.102
What is your platform?

466
00:17:16.102 --> 00:17:18.571
Um, I've been messing
with a few.

467
00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:19.972
I was trying to think of, like,

468
00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.808
creating funding
for the arts and crafts.

469
00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:26.979
Oh, I'm asleep already.
Boring!

470
00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:28.614
Listen to what
you're being told.

471
00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:29.682
That's not gonna work.

472
00:17:29.682 --> 00:17:32.752
So if that's in there,
get rid of it.

473
00:17:32.752 --> 00:17:34.654
[all laugh]
It's just one of those things.

474
00:17:34.654 --> 00:17:38.391
You have to listen to what nods
you're being given.

475
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.894
Let me ask you this.
What is the Crystal Methyd?

476
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:46.799
Ugh, uh...

477
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:49.268
These are the questions
I would be asking myself.

478
00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.369
Yeah.

479
00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:51.871
What I am,
what I stand for, you know?

480
00:17:51.871 --> 00:17:53.639
Mm-hmm.

481
00:17:53.639 --> 00:17:55.875
My walkthrough with Ru
is not going well,

482
00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:58.811
but I know
that Ru sees what's in me,

483
00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:01.347
and I just need to find it and
bring it out for this challenge.

484
00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:04.317
All right, Crystal,
I know you can do it.

485
00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:06.852
Just you gotta unlock that door.
Let's hit it, Raven.

486
00:18:06.852 --> 00:18:08.621
-Bye.
-Bye.

487
00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:13.960
All right, ladies, gather round.
Gather round, ladies.

488
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.763
Now, tomorrow,
the Choices 2020 debate

489
00:18:17.763 --> 00:18:21.734
will be moderated by
our extra-special guest judges,

490
00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:25.004
my crazy ex-squirrel friend
Rachel Bloom...

491
00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:26.272
[cheering]
Yes!

492
00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:30.343
And the super fly
Jeff Goldblum.

493
00:18:30.343 --> 00:18:31.911
[cheers and applause]

494
00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:34.814
Jeff Goldblum
is a dinosaur doctor.

495
00:18:34.814 --> 00:18:36.749
Now, I don't know
if that's his real life,

496
00:18:36.749 --> 00:18:40.086
but I love a man
who knows about dinosaurs.

497
00:18:40.086 --> 00:18:43.155
Ladies, don't fuck it up.

498
00:18:43.155 --> 00:18:44.790
Come on, Raven.

499
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.759
-Bye!
-Thank you!end act

500
00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:53.165
Come on, Season 12,
let's get political!

501
00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:54.700
Yeah!

502
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.336
Child, whew, today is the day.

503
00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:58.938
We're gonna do this debate.

504
00:18:58.938 --> 00:19:00.773
What's important
for us to do in this challenge

505
00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:03.643
is to make sure that
we give it a political tone.

506
00:19:03.643 --> 00:19:06.479
But don't forget, a bitch
can't come in being all serious.

507
00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.381
You gotta make sure
you making the judges laugh.

508
00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:10.449
How are people feeling?

509
00:19:10.449 --> 00:19:12.418
I feel good,
but I also felt good

510
00:19:12.418 --> 00:19:14.053
about the last thing
I had to be funny at.

511
00:19:14.053 --> 00:19:17.656
So hopefully I can do
the American people proud.

512
00:19:17.656 --> 00:19:19.458
-Choices.
-Choices.

513
00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.227
-Choices.
-Choices.

514
00:19:21.227 --> 00:19:23.696
[laughs] So I don't know
if I'm just delirious

515
00:19:23.696 --> 00:19:26.432
from not sleeping all night,
but I feel good

516
00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:30.503
that I got some funny shit
so let's see. [laughs]

517
00:19:30.503 --> 00:19:34.306
I'm gonna get to nerd out
a little bit in this challenge,

518
00:19:34.306 --> 00:19:36.942
because it do take nerd.

519
00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:41.113
I love politics
and I love making people laugh.

520
00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:44.116
I'm very excited to show Ru

521
00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.718
that I don't just deserve
to be in the top,

522
00:19:45.718 --> 00:19:48.554
I deserve
that mother-tucking win.

523
00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:52.258
Anyone here really passionate
about politics besides Jackie?

524
00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:55.261
The current political climate
is just so terrifying to me.

525
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:56.429
Gigi, I get it.

526
00:19:56.429 --> 00:19:58.531
Like, it's hard to sit
and watch the news.

527
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:01.400
It can be traumatizing
to sit and watch that stuff.

528
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.768
But I feel like in bad times,

529
00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:06.138
like, this is more important
than ever to be patriotic,

530
00:20:06.138 --> 00:20:09.308
because you need that
to, like, make a change.

531
00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:12.311
And right now, we really,
really, really, really,

532
00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:14.213
really, really,
really need a change.

533
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.682
My parents are both
really conservative,

534
00:20:16.682 --> 00:20:18.651
and they voted for Trump, and--

535
00:20:18.651 --> 00:20:20.486
-Wow, really?
-Yeah.

536
00:20:20.486 --> 00:20:22.121
Do they still stand
by that vote?

537
00:20:22.121 --> 00:20:25.224
They do, and it's really hard,

538
00:20:25.224 --> 00:20:27.359
because I love my parents
and I'm so close to them.

539
00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.528
And I'm like almost,
like, confused

540
00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:31.330
as to how I grew up
in their house

541
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.731
and share
so many of their values

542
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:36.302
when there are just some things
we have this disconnect on.

543
00:20:36.302 --> 00:20:38.070
I can't even imagine, knowing
how close you are with them,

544
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.505
like, what that's like.

545
00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:43.109
Yeah. It's frustrating to have
parents that support Trump.

546
00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:46.078
I just try not
to bring up politics

547
00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.214
when I'm with my family,
although there are times

548
00:20:48.214 --> 00:20:50.049
during our family Thanksgiving
and stuff

549
00:20:50.049 --> 00:20:51.550
that I have, like, blown up.

550
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.819
All I can do
is try and provide them

551
00:20:53.819 --> 00:20:55.988
with as much education as I can

552
00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:57.656
whenever
I get the opportunity.

553
00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.825
I have a lot of disagreements
with my mom

554
00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:01.160
and with other people
in my family.

555
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.629
But the one thing that
we all agreed on was no Trump.

556
00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:06.732
It's, like, really affected mine
and my family's life.

557
00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:07.800
When Trump was elected,

558
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.703
he enacted terrible,
racist policies,

559
00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:14.607
including a ban on people
from Muslim-majority countries.

560
00:21:14.607 --> 00:21:17.643
You know, my mom moved here
right before the revolution,

561
00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:20.479
but her close sister
is still back in Iran,

562
00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.715
and my mom has actually been
having a lot of health issues

563
00:21:22.715 --> 00:21:23.949
in the last couple years.

564
00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.919
And we were hoping that
her sister could come here

565
00:21:26.919 --> 00:21:29.488
and kind of help
take care of my mom,

566
00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:34.593
and because of Trump and racism,
it's not happening.

567
00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:39.365
And I just don't think
that's okay.

568
00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:42.301
My aunt is the sweetest woman

569
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.104
and has always been there
for my mom.

570
00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:46.906
And the fact
that she can't be there now

571
00:21:46.906 --> 00:21:49.375
because of Trump's travel ban
is devastating.

572
00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:53.112
These are two women who, you
know, need each other right now.

573
00:21:53.112 --> 00:21:55.047
-Yeah.
-And more than anything

574
00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:59.151
I'm just so angry
that this is America.

575
00:22:00.452 --> 00:22:05.257
As a black, gay man
in this country,

576
00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:06.826
and especially
being in Missouri,

577
00:22:06.826 --> 00:22:09.728
I don't go places in my own city

578
00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.830
that are
predominantly, like--

579
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.599
have, like, straight patriots.

580
00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:16.735
And as a black man,
it's a big problem

581
00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:19.805
that I cannot drive my car
down the street

582
00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:22.274
without being afraid that
someone's going to take my life.

583
00:22:22.274 --> 00:22:26.779
With all the stuff
that Trump and the Republicans

584
00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:29.548
have put this country through,

585
00:22:29.548 --> 00:22:33.953
put people of color through,
queer people, LGBTQIA,

586
00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:38.824
we need to be on the front
lines fighting every day.

587
00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:42.628
I think people who gave him the
benefit of the doubt in 2016,

588
00:22:42.628 --> 00:22:45.364
like, wake up, because there
is nothing to doubt here.

589
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:47.833
This person is not here
for Americans.

590
00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:50.302
What I try to do myself is just,
like, make sure that I get out,

591
00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.571
like, to everybody
that's in my family

592
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.706
and to give them information.

593
00:22:53.706 --> 00:22:55.708
If we get as much information
as we can,

594
00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:59.011
it's like a weapon against
people who try to hold us back.

595
00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:01.247
The further we go back
into the shadows,

596
00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:04.283
the stronger the clown
in the White House gets.

597
00:23:05.851 --> 00:23:07.586
No more closets!

00:23:07.586 --> 00:23:09.989

I was the secretary of my high

-I remember that.
-You were a great president.

why do you deserve

is very clear.

of the bitches, for the bitches.

700
00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:51.003
Finally, a spokesperson
for the bitches.

701
00:27:51.003 --> 00:27:54.106
She done already
done had herses.

702
00:27:54.106 --> 00:27:56.308
Let's proceed with questions.

703
00:27:56.308 --> 00:27:59.411
Crystal Methyd, if you were
elected first drag president,

704
00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.647
what would your first
official action be?

705
00:28:01.647 --> 00:28:05.317
To include bare chests and bare
backs to the Second Amendment,

706
00:28:05.317 --> 00:28:08.287
because bare arms
are not enough!

707
00:28:08.287 --> 00:28:10.889
Quite powerful.
Widow Von'Du.

708
00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:14.860
The first thing I would do in
office is do a split on the D.

709
00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:17.229
A split on--
A split on the D?

710
00:28:17.229 --> 00:28:21.533
Deficits! I would split
the deficits in half.

711
00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:23.368
Well, if she did it,
it would certainly break.

712
00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.137
Oh! The slander.

713
00:28:25.137 --> 00:28:28.040
Candidates, candidates,
let's keep it civil, okay?

714
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.341
Jackie Cox, same question.

715
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.109
I'll be recruiting Deborah Cox

716
00:28:31.109 --> 00:28:33.312
to disco-fy the national anthem.

717
00:28:33.312 --> 00:28:35.013
Can I do a little bit
for you right now?

718
00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:36.148
Please.

719
00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:37.149

You're bringing up Canada a lot.

If I were you, I would not keep
pushing this Canada aspect.

No sissification so far.
But wait.

If that is the walk of America,

740
00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:24.630

I would like to re-tittle
that rebuttal.

745
00:29:34.206 --> 00:29:35.474
I think the only thing

746
00:29:35.474 --> 00:29:38.710
that Miss Goode needs
to sissy is that hairline.

747
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.179
Okay, ladies, ladies,
let's keep it civil.

00:34:30.802 --> 00:34:36.207
I'm going to prioritize,
politicize, and accessorize.

876
00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:38.543
You repeated that bit
about the accessorizing.

877
00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:40.345
Bah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

878

That's okay. Widow Von'Du.

I promise you that a change
is on the horizon.

880

I say shablam
for a better future.

881
00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.224
What does "shablam" mean,
actually?

882
00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:56.361
See, uneducated.
This is the problem in America.

883
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:58.063
Uneducated people.

884
00:34:58.063 --> 00:34:59.831
-Ooh, girl!
-Wow.

885
00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:01.166
Did you just call Jeff
uneducated?

886
00:35:01.166 --> 00:35:02.934
You just called Jeff uneducated.

Here's the thing.

00:35:20.552 --> 00:35:22.520
The candidates did not
even bring up the issue--

897
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.655
Oops, and we're out of time.

898
00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.191
Well, that concludes
tonight's debate.

It's time for
the judges' critiques,

982
00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:42.120
starting with Sherry Pie.

983
00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.456
During the debate
you were really, really funny,

984
00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:47.425
and it felt like a really
polished character to me.

985
00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.227
I would just say be careful

986
00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:51.262
about giving us
variety of characters.

987
00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:55.166
It was similar, I think,
to your mother in Gay's Anatomy

988
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:58.570
in that it was an older person,
like you did for Snatch Game.

989
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.905
I'm definitely gonna steal
this look from you.

990
00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:02.907
I love the peplum-esque thing

991
00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:04.842
that's happening
with the jacket.

992
00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:08.713
And you accentuate your fine
and generous décolletage,

993
00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:09.714
I believe is the--

994
00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:11.616
-Oh, yes.
-Ah. You see, I know.

995
00:39:11.616 --> 00:39:15.720
I may not know "peplum,"
but I know décolletage.

996
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.623
All right, up next,
Crystal Methyd.

997
00:39:18.623 --> 00:39:20.091
Hi.

998
00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:22.260
In the debate, I thought
you were a real stand-out

999
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:25.096
because you were stumping
to be the drag president.

1000
00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:27.332
You did a really great job
of embracing that concept.

1001
00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.167
You talked about
your love of glitter.

1002
00:39:29.167 --> 00:39:31.202
I'm gonna cover the White House
in glitter!

1003
00:39:31.202 --> 00:39:33.671
And we've always said bring
the you to the challenge,

1004
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:35.340
and I thought you did that
really well.

1005
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.109
And there was never
a moment of fear.

1006
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:40.545
You just seemed incredibly
sure of your character

1007
00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:41.813
and having a ball.

1008
00:39:41.813 --> 00:39:44.983
This runway look might be
a little bit confused.

1009
00:39:44.983 --> 00:39:48.086
I think the grosgrain belt
I think is a great touch,

1010
00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:51.489
but having all of that excess
to me was very distracting.

1011
00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:55.326
But when I see a fedora,
it's awful nice.

1012
00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:56.661
You find them fedorable.

1013
00:39:56.661 --> 00:39:58.029
-Yes, yeah.
-Ah, as you say.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.802
I have to say
I fell into the gap.

1017
00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:06.204
-Did you really?
-Yeah.

1018
00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:08.506
I thought your debate
was really charming.

1019
00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:11.175
I think tapping into
your small-town roots

1020
00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:13.378
from Ramseur, North Carolina,
was great.

1021
00:40:13.378 --> 00:40:15.546
You know, you embraced
who you are.

1022
00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.382
Yeah, you ever read
Tennessee Williams?

1023
00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:20.218
I'd like to see you do
Glass Menagerie or something.

1024
00:40:20.218 --> 00:40:21.352
Ooh.

1025
00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:24.022
I'm more partial
to the Ass Menagerie myself.

1027
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.159
And then this look, I just
feel like you're serving me

Baby June and her Newsboys.

1029
00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:34.198

I love that you're the standout
in this lineup.

1034
00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:45.910
The challenge
was Stars and Stripes,

1035
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.413
and you gave us that
in a nontraditional way.

1036
00:40:48.413 --> 00:40:50.515
I love that
it's black and white.

1037
00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:51.582
The presentation is perfect.

1038
00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.351
During the debate,

1039
00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:56.354
I thought you made some
really wonderful points,

1040
00:40:56.354 --> 00:40:59.357
and looking at drag
as a form of theater

1041
00:40:59.357 --> 00:41:01.192
to challenge you
and make you think,

1042
00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:03.261
I thought you did
such an excellent job.

1043
00:41:03.261 --> 00:41:06.664
I was craving, I guess
for lack of a better term,

1044
00:41:06.664 --> 00:41:08.099
like, a joke punch-up in there.

1045
00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:12.103
You're such a presence on stage
and you're so commanding,

1046
00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:15.707
but I felt like kind of it came
across just a little bit angry.

1047
00:41:15.707 --> 00:41:16.975
Terrorists!

1048
00:41:16.975 --> 00:41:19.744
I wanted to give you
a politician that was angry

1049
00:41:19.744 --> 00:41:21.746
because they are trying
to get their point across.

1050
00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:25.416
And I just don't know...

1051
00:41:25.416 --> 00:41:27.085
[sighs]

1052
00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:32.857
It's very difficult to satirize

1053
00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:36.127
or do something that's wackier,
funnier, wilder

1054
00:41:36.127 --> 00:41:37.528
than of course
what's going on now.

1055
00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:40.264
-That's right.
-I generally was having fun.

1056
00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.934
Playing the character
that I was doing,

1057
00:41:42.934 --> 00:41:46.037
I literally thought
I was doing the challenge.

1058
00:41:46.037 --> 00:41:47.305
You did do the challenge.

1059
00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:49.073
What the judges are saying

1060
00:41:49.073 --> 00:41:51.576
is that there weren't
a lot of laughs in it,

1061
00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:55.046
and of course that's really
what we're doing here.

1062
00:41:55.046 --> 00:41:58.683
I stayed up till 4:30 in
the morning just writing stuff,

1063
00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:01.652
and it just feels like
it was all for nothing.

1064
00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:05.056
You're digging yourself
into a hole right now,

1065
00:42:05.056 --> 00:42:06.524
and you don't have to do that.

1066
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:08.893
This is all just
constructive criticism.

1067
00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:12.430
I am a musical theater kid,
and you raise yourself

1068
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.299
to think that your craft,
your art is who you are.

1069
00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:16.567
And when you
fuck something up,

1070
00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:19.270
it fundamentally takes away
your self-worth.

1071
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.304
Preach!

1072
00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:23.207
And separating
a little more your craft

1073
00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:26.744
from who you are as a person,
it's really helped me.

1074
00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.346
Let the church say a-man.

1075
00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:29.714
-A-man.
-A-man.

1076
00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:33.317
That is so important right now.

1077
00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:34.719
And do you hear
what she's saying, Widow?

1078
00:42:34.719 --> 00:42:38.189
I hear everything that everybody
is saying to me.

1079
00:42:38.189 --> 00:42:40.425
I just--it's really hard
for me to be here and just--

1080
00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:41.759
It's hard. The competition's
fucking hard.

1081
00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.428
But don't do that to yourself.

1082
00:42:43.428 --> 00:42:45.196
The payoff is not worth it.

1083
00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:48.833
You belong here, and don't let
your saboteur do that.

1084
00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:52.403
So catch yourself.
Be the star that you are.

1085
00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.539
Thank you.

1086
00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:57.809
Up next, Jackie Cox.

1087
00:42:57.809 --> 00:42:59.043
Salaam, RuPaul June.

1088
00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:00.611
So the debate.

1089
00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:03.915
When I figured out what
your whole shtick was "aboot,"

1090
00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:06.350
I thought
this is gonna get good.

1091
00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.287
For me, the Canada thing
became a little tiresome.

1092
00:43:09.287 --> 00:43:11.556
Jeff even said,
"Can you answer this question

1093
00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:13.257
and not reference Canada."

1094
00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:16.394
You're talented, obviously,
and bright and quick.

1095
00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:18.663
But it's a one-joke idea,
and you know,

1096
00:43:18.663 --> 00:43:20.631
you keep doing variations
of that, there you go.

1097
00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.868
In comedy, you always want some
sort of element of surprise.

1098
00:43:23.868 --> 00:43:26.337
So unless you heighten
to the absurd,

1099
00:43:26.337 --> 00:43:29.774
there was just kind of
a plateauing point.

1100
00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:31.476
Let's talk about
your runway look.

1101
00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:33.945
You exposed a piece of you
and your heritage,

1102
00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:37.782
embracing something
very beautiful and touching,

1103
00:43:37.782 --> 00:43:39.951
and this makes
a political statement.

1104
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:41.619
I love what this says about
what America really is,

1105
00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:43.921
which is, yeah,
we're a nation of immigrants,

1106
00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.690
of people
who come from everywhere,

1107
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:46.958
and we come together.

1108
00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:51.062
And it's such a simple outfit
that says so much.

1109
00:43:51.062 --> 00:43:52.964
Are you religious, may I ask?

1110
00:43:52.964 --> 00:43:54.866
I'm not, and to be honest,

1111
00:43:54.866 --> 00:43:57.034
this outfit really represents
the importance

1112
00:43:57.034 --> 00:44:00.004
that visibility for people
of religious minorities

1113
00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.973
need to have in this country.

1114
00:44:01.973 --> 00:44:03.975
Isn't this an interesting
wrinkle, though.

1115
00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:06.711
Is there something
in that religion

1116
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:12.350
that is anti-homosexuality
and anti-woman?

1117
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.952
Does that complicate the issue?

1118
00:44:14.952 --> 00:44:16.754
I'm just raising it
and thinking out loud,

1119
00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.356
and maybe being stupid,
but what do you think?

1120
00:44:18.356 --> 00:44:21.058
No, no, I think, you know,
drag has always

1121
00:44:21.058 --> 00:44:22.960
shaken the tree, so to speak,

1122
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.531
and there are so many different
layers to this presentation.

1123
00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:28.533
And if it
was ever gonna be done,

1124
00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:29.901
this is the stage to do it.

1125
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:31.435
It's a complex issue.

1126
00:44:31.435 --> 00:44:33.938
I have my own misgivings
about the way

1127
00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:36.440
that LGBT people
are treated in the Middle East.

1128
00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.576
And at the same time, I am one.

1129
00:44:38.576 --> 00:44:41.212
But what is so important
is to me,

1130
00:44:41.212 --> 00:44:44.682
that if you just happen
to be different,

1131
00:44:44.682 --> 00:44:46.717
then, like, live that truth.

1132
00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:51.422
And when the Muslim ban
happened,

1133
00:44:51.422 --> 00:45:00.097
it really destroyed a lot
of my faith in this country.

1134
00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:03.134
And it really hurt my family.

1135
00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:07.371
[sobs] And that's
so wrong to me.

1136
00:45:08.873 --> 00:45:13.945
And I had to show America

1137
00:45:13.945 --> 00:45:19.717
that you can be LGBT
and from the Middle East

1138
00:45:19.717 --> 00:45:21.619
and there's gonna be
complicated shit around that,

1139
00:45:21.619 --> 00:45:22.687
and that's okay.

1140
00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:25.890
But I'm here,

1141
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.291
and I deserve to be in America

1142
00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.293
just as much as anyone else.

1143
00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:32.096
Everything you're saying
really registers with me.

1144
00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:35.833
At the end of the day,
this country is for everyone,

1145
00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:40.938
and I'm so sorry that this
has happened to your family.

1146
00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.573
Thank you, guys.

1147
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.542
Thank you, Jackie.

1148
00:45:44.542 --> 00:45:46.677
[sniffles]

1149
00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:49.046
Up next, Gigi Goode.

1150
00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:50.548
Let's talk about this look.

1151
00:45:50.548 --> 00:45:55.953
Normally, I hate a minute man,
but this is fantastic.

1152
00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:59.724
It's beautiful and tailored.
It's delicious.

1153
00:45:59.724 --> 00:46:00.992
But are you dressed
as an American

1154
00:46:00.992 --> 00:46:02.593
or are you dressed as a Redcoat?

1155
00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:05.529
You'll never tell.
Maybe you're Benedict Arnold.

1156
00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:06.731
Certainly not Bene-dick Arnold.

1157
00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:08.966
Nope, maybe not tonight.
[all laugh]

1158
00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:11.936
How, exactly--because
I'm a little unfamiliar--

1159
00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:15.606
so what do you--
how--how--what--

1160
00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:17.508
Yeah.

1161
00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.045
What do you do, exactly?

1162
00:46:21.045 --> 00:46:22.580
Is it--is it all tucked?
[all laugh]

1163
00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:25.716
Everything is tucked,
and you can achieve that--

1164
00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:29.286
It's not something for
national television right now.

1165
00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:31.589
Okay, okay.
[all laugh]

1166
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:33.991
I'm not sure.
Are you a big politics fan?

1167
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:36.193
You know,
unfortunately, I'm not.

1168
00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.428
No further questions.

1169
00:46:37.428 --> 00:46:39.830
Yeah, I think that hurt you
in this challenge,

1170
00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.098
because to be able
to parody something,

1171
00:46:41.098 --> 00:46:43.167
you have to kind of have
a base knowledge of it.

1172
00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:45.169
And I felt like
maybe that was missing,

1173
00:46:45.169 --> 00:46:46.704
and you were
a little less confident

1174
00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:48.339
and a little more quiet
than you normally are.

1175
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.077
Up next, Jaida Essence Hall.

1176
00:46:53.077 --> 00:46:54.345
Hi, y'all.

1177
00:46:54.345 --> 00:46:56.514
Let's re-tattle the re-tittle
of her rebuttal.

1178
00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:58.549
[all laugh]

1179
00:46:58.549 --> 00:47:00.284
Your platform
was about being confused

1180
00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:03.087
with what's going on in politics
today, and I'm with you.

1181
00:47:03.087 --> 00:47:05.756
You had a great moment where
Jeff had asked you a question,

1182
00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.791
and you didn't really know
the answer.

1183
00:47:06.791 --> 00:47:07.925
You were like,
"Look over there."

1184
00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:09.860
It was so genius.

1185
00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.861
I liked it, too.

1186
00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:12.096
I don't know if you planned it.

1187
00:47:12.096 --> 00:47:14.231
I really wanted to, like,
show how politicians

1188
00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:16.567
are always, like, well,
whatever we have to say

1189
00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.002
to get the attention off of me.

1190
00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:19.370
Yeah, you had

1191
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:21.972
the best off-the-cuff remarks
in the debate.

1192
00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.574
You made me laugh the most.

1193
00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:26.911
You just did
Jaida Goes to Washington.

1194
00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.012
Ooh!

1195
00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.013
And it was really effective.

1196
00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:30.815
2020, honey.

1197
00:47:30.815 --> 00:47:32.450
We're getting ready, baby.

1198
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:35.519
And this outfit,
wowie, wow-wow-wow.

1199
00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:37.588
Yeah, that's something.

1200
00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.490
[all laugh]

1201
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:41.425
I don't know
where your body ends

1202
00:47:41.425 --> 00:47:43.627
and then, like,
the illusion begins,

1203
00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.895
and I guess I don't wanna know.

1204
00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.398
But I also wanna know
everything.

1205
00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:49.233
[all laugh]

1206
00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:51.302
This outfit makes me proud
to be an American.

1207
00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:52.837
Oh, well, thank you.

1208
00:47:52.837 --> 00:47:53.938
Thank you, ladies.

1209
00:47:53.938 --> 00:47:55.372
I think we've heard enough.

1210
00:47:55.372 --> 00:48:00.511
While you untuck backstage,
the judges and I will debate.

1211
00:48:01.812 --> 00:48:06.016
All right, now, just between
us political animals,

1212
00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:07.618
what do you think?

1213
00:48:07.618 --> 00:48:09.120
Sherry Pie.

1214
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.955
In the debate, I thought
she was pretty polished.

1215
00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:14.592
I could tell it was a character
that she had done before.

1216
00:48:14.592 --> 00:48:15.726
It's just getting
a little tired.

1217
00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:17.661
Throughout the season,
on the runway

1218
00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:19.130
she was giving us
a lot of, you know, dresses

1219
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.264
with kind of
a trumpet kind of shape.

1220
00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:23.033
So this was
a refreshing change for me.

1221
00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:24.735
Crystal Methyd.

1222
00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:29.006
She didn't try too hard
to do the politician act.

1223
00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:31.675
She just did Crystal Methyd.

1224
00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:32.810
And then her runway look
was amazing.

1225
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:34.478
It went so different.

1226
00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:36.247
Yeah, I love
Crystal Methyd's aesthetic,

1227
00:48:36.247 --> 00:48:38.983
and I'm so happy that
at this point in the competition

1228
00:48:38.983 --> 00:48:40.985
she's really
finding her confidence

1229
00:48:40.985 --> 00:48:43.187
to just be her freaky self.

1230
00:48:43.187 --> 00:48:44.588
Heidi.

1231
00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:47.158
During the debate, I got an air
of real sweetness from her.

1232
00:48:47.158 --> 00:48:48.292
What she smartly did,

1233
00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:50.461
when she didn't have
something funny to say,

1234
00:48:50.461 --> 00:48:52.863
she gave us a funny reaction
to somebody else.

1235
00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.799
She gave us a pearl clutch
and a gasp.

1236
00:48:54.799 --> 00:48:56.534
She reminds me a little bit
of Jimmy Carter

1237
00:48:56.534 --> 00:48:58.202
and President Clinton, too.

1238
00:48:58.202 --> 00:49:00.571
She reminds me of George Clinton
and Billy Carter.

1239
00:49:00.571 --> 00:49:03.073
Ah. [laughs]

1240
00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:05.810
The Widow Von'Du.

1241
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.179
She almost just played the part

1242
00:49:08.179 --> 00:49:10.114
of an actual candidate
for president.

1243
00:49:10.114 --> 00:49:12.316
There was nothing
that drag about it.

1244
00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:14.485
I think it's good to be
conscientious and preparation,

1245
00:49:14.485 --> 00:49:17.688
but sometimes I say
get some sleep.

1246
00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:19.023
[laughs]

1247
00:49:19.023 --> 00:49:21.559
Although she didn't pop
in the debate,

1248
00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:22.893
she could have
remained positive,

1249
00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:25.663
because her runway look
was really striking.

1250
00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:28.732
But I feel like she's almost
giving up on herself.

1251
00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:33.671
It is like the thorns of a rose
growing inward on itself,

1252
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:37.074
but it's hers
to understand this about herself

1253
00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.542
and to dig herself out of it.

1254
00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.777
Jackie Cox.

1255
00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:41.879
For the debate,
I say blame Canada.

1256
00:49:41.879 --> 00:49:43.047
[all laugh]

1257
00:49:43.047 --> 00:49:44.381
I think over-preparation

1258
00:49:44.381 --> 00:49:46.217
may have gotten in her way
this week.

1259
00:49:46.217 --> 00:49:48.385
And it started really strong,

1260
00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.955
but it got really tired
really fast.

1261
00:49:50.955 --> 00:49:56.260
But her runway look was
beautiful and sort of amazing.

1262
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.262
That outfit
spoke so many volumes,

1263
00:49:58.262 --> 00:49:59.797
and hearing about her family

1264
00:49:59.797 --> 00:50:01.732
emphasized
what she was going for.

1265
00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.467
Gigi Goode.

1266
00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.636
When I saw her standing there
to start her debate,

1267
00:50:05.636 --> 00:50:07.104
she looked so great.

1268
00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.940
It looked like Ralph Lauren
and Emilio Pucci had a baby.

1269
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.208
Yes!

1270
00:50:11.208 --> 00:50:12.810
But there was a kind of
deer-in-headlights quality.

1271
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.745
I would love to have seen
more politics,

1272
00:50:14.745 --> 00:50:17.114
even if it was just absurd.

1273
00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:19.783
I would have just been throwing
in political words like caucus.

1274
00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:20.985
[all laugh]

1275
00:50:20.985 --> 00:50:23.053
Jaida Essence Hall.

1276
00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.955
She was so fun
during the debate.

1277
00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.624
She was just so sharp.

1278
00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:29.426
The insults that she threw
were so quick.

1279
00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:34.164
And it's actually a beautiful
social commentary on politics.

1280
00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.634
Yeah. We have every right
to be confused.

1281
00:50:36.634 --> 00:50:40.037
And then tonight's runway look
was funny and fabulous.

1282
00:50:40.037 --> 00:50:42.039
She is the woman I aspire to be

1283
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:43.173
when I get dressed
in the morning,

1284
00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:45.142
and I know that
I will never look like that.

1285
00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:48.212
All right, so let's go to
Michelle Visage via satellite

1286
00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:49.980
and hear what she has to say.

1287
00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.148
Hi, Michelle!

1288
00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:52.716
[static]
Ru! Oh, my God.

1289
00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.285
First and foremost...

1290
00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:55.886
Um, excuse me.

1291
00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:58.055
Who is that woman
sitting next to you?

1292
00:50:58.055 --> 00:51:00.190
It's a bad transmission.

1293
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.693
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Who is that by your side?

1294
00:51:02.693 --> 00:51:03.928
Okay, we'll just move on.

1295
00:51:03.928 --> 00:51:06.030
What a shame, what a shame.
What a loss.

1296
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.966
Oh, hell, no. This is not
some girl sitting in my seat.

1297
00:51:08.966 --> 00:51:11.001
Silence.

1298
00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:12.770
I've made my decision.

1299
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.805
I will not be silenced!
Listen to me!

1300
00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:15.873
-Turn it off.
-Who is that woman--

1301
00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:16.874
[static]

1302
00:51:16.874 --> 00:51:19.310
Bring back my girls.end act

1303
00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:22.846
Welcome back, ladies.

1304
00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.882
I've made some decisions.

1305
00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:31.188
Sherry Pie.

1306
00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.289
You're safe.

1307
00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:35.225
You may step
to the back of the stage.

1308
00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.833
Heidi.

1309
00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:47.738
Tonight, lady sings
the red, white, and blues.

1310
00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.609
-You're safe.
-Thank you.

1311
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.879
Jaida Essence Hall.

1312
00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:58.983
Your campaign
was all about confusion,

1313
00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:03.821
but tonight, it's very clear.

1314
00:52:03.821 --> 00:52:06.190
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1315
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.358
[applause]

1316
00:52:07.358 --> 00:52:08.926
Oh, my God. [laughs]

1317
00:52:08.926 --> 00:52:10.661
Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

1318
00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:15.099
Con-drag-ulations. You've
won a cash tip of $5.000.

1319
00:52:15.099 --> 00:52:17.534
Ooh, I can buy nice shoes.

1320
00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:20.004
You may join the other girls.

1321
00:52:20.004 --> 00:52:22.706
Bitch, I won another
motherfucking--

1322
00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.241
I can't say motherfucking,
can I?

1323
00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:25.676
I won!

1324
00:52:25.676 --> 00:52:27.244
That's it. [laughs]

1325
00:52:29.213 --> 00:52:30.247
Crystal Methyd.

1326
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:35.953
You're safe. Glitterally.

1327
00:52:35.953 --> 00:52:37.154
[laughs] Thank you.

1328
00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:42.326
Widow Von'Du.

1329
00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:47.197
On the runway, you stood out
like the star that you are.

1330
00:52:47.197 --> 00:52:52.169
But in the debate, you blended
into the background.

1331
00:52:52.169 --> 00:52:53.771
Jackie Cox.

1332
00:52:53.771 --> 00:52:58.442
Your runway look
is bold and beautiful,

1333
00:52:58.442 --> 00:53:04.214
but your debate performance
was a little Canada Dry.

1334
00:53:05.382 --> 00:53:07.551
Gigi Goode.

1335
00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:11.021
This runway look
is a feather in your cap,

1336
00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:15.926
but your debate
was not revolutionary.

1337
00:53:19.029 --> 00:53:20.264
Gigi Goode.

1338
00:53:23.267 --> 00:53:24.568
You're safe.

1339
00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:26.737
You may join the other girls.

1340
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.776
You will not see me
in the bottom again.

1341
00:53:37.181 --> 00:53:40.484
Widow Von'Du, Jackie Cox,

1342
00:53:40.484 --> 00:53:42.252
I'm sorry, my dears,

1343
00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:46.023
but you are up for elimination.

1344
00:53:47.491 --> 00:53:50.360
Two queens stand before me.

1345
00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.798
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1346
00:53:54.798 --> 00:54:00.471
and save yourself
from elimination.

1347
00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:04.274
The time has come...
[thunder]

1348
00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:07.644
for you to lip sync...

1349
00:54:07.644 --> 00:54:12.015
[echoing] for your life!

1350
00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:16.653
I want Mama Ru to see
why she brought me here,

1351
00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:19.323
and that even though I
let her down in this challenge,

1352
00:54:19.323 --> 00:54:20.757
I'm a fighter,

1353
00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:23.360
and I'm not gonna let her down
in this lip sync.

1354
00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:27.331
Oh, trust, I am not losing this.

1355
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:29.533
This is my chance
to redeem myself,

1356
00:54:29.533 --> 00:54:32.569
and I'm not ready
for this dream to die.

1357
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:38.008
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
