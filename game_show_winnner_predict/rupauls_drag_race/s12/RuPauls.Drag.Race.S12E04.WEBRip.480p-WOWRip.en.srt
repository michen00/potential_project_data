00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,774

39
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,517

40
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,419

Like, bitch, I told you so.

45
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,963
You didn't lead us at all.

46
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,333
At times, I felt like
we were carrying you.

47
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,369
I thought I did a good job.

00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,739
I am happy that I chose

49
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,376
two powerhouses of queens
for my team,

50
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:24,244
and we fucking did it.

51
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,980
I still think that Aiden
is a weak competitor,

52
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,082
but she's definitely
a smart bitch.

53
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,851
I mean, she picked me.

54
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,519
I thought I did a good job.

55
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,022
I mean, it would have been nice
to get critiqued on something

56
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:37,357
that I like to think
that I'm very, very good at.

57
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,159
It was nice to be safe,

58
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,795
but, like,
I wanna be at the top, honey.

59
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,531
Because of Brita's reputation
in New York,

60
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:47,000
she came in here
expecting that her name

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,001
would carry her
through the competition

62
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,436
and that she would slay.

63
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:52,105
But unfortunately, Brita,
it doesn't work that way.

64
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,807
It's like Nicky said.

65
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:55,409
I mean, different situations,
of course,

66
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,777

the past two challenges

I should be excelling in.

saying, like,

00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,315
Why are you killing the bees?

180
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,750
[all laugh]

181
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,918
Heidi!

182
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,987
I will never say
"Heidi N Closet" ever again.

183
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,357
I'm just putting that out there.

184
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:13,093
My bee likes to make
a statement.

185
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,728
If you take a close look
at her drawers,

186
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:17,097
it says, "Bee-lieve."

187
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:20,166
[laughs]

188
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,369
Don't get your knickers
in a honeybunch.

189
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,737
What did I call me?

190
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,441
Brita. [laughs]

191
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,710
Yeah!

192
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,946
Whoo!

193
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:36,249
Nicky Doll.
Get it, Miss Sting.

194
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,684
Oh!

195
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,720
[cheering]

196
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,889
Jaida Essence Hall.

197
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,025
Come on, girl.

198
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,159
[laughs]

199
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,395
Whoo!

200
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,398
Ooh, she is giving me Bee-yonce.

201
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:53,700
Aiden Zhane.

202
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,969
Ooh, and this bitch
is giving me Bee Arthur.

203
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,705
Aiden is definitely
the Edith Piaf of the beehive.

204
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,939
Bitch look sad.

205
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,444
Simply Jan.

206
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,246
[cheering]

207
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,348
Oh, honey.

208
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,316
Yes, honey!

209
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,719
Crystal Methyd.

210
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,654
Ooh, careful
with that stinger.

211
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,922
Just the tip.

212
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,158
[cheering]

213
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,493
Gigi Goode.

214
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,862
[cheering]

215
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,697
-Yes!
-[laughs]

216
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,466
Hey!

217
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,801
Yes!

218
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,606
[cheering]

219
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,976
Shake that stinger, mama!

220
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,850
Ladies, the winner
of today's mini-challenge is...

221
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,821
Gigi Goode.

222
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,089
Yes!
[applause]

223
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,359
Yes, I won
the mini-challenge! [laughs]

224
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,128
I think this means

225
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,931
that I'm the Queen Bee
of the season, doesn't it?

226
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,499
Con-drag-ulations.

227
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:03,002
You've won
$2.500 cash money, henny.

228
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,938
Okay! All right!

229
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,806
And in your name,

230
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,877
Hask will be making
a $2.500 donation

231
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,713
to the HoneyBeeConservancy.org,

232
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:17,650
where you'll find simple things
you can do to save the bees.

233
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,253
Aw. Yay!
[applause]

234
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,355
And most importantly,

235
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,557
we'll be posting your bee videos

236
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,960
on Instagram
at RuPaul's Drag Race

237
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,629
to haunt you
for the rest of your lives.

238
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,097
[all laugh]

239
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,901
Now, ladies, did you know
Drag Race and sports

240
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,803
have a lot in common?

241
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,439
They both involve competition,

242
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,907
colorful outfits,

243
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,209
and balls.

244
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,244
Okay.

245
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,879
So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

246
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,582
we are throwing
a fashion ball, darling.

247
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,451
[cheering]

248
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,253
Why y'all gagging so?

249
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,822
She bring it to you every ball.

250
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,357
Always gagging on the balls.

251
00:10:57,357 --> 00:11:01,227
Now, you need to slam-dunk
three homerun looks.

252
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,364
The first look is Lady Baller,

253
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,800
serving sexy Title IX realness.

254
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,104
Second look,
Basketball Wife Realness,

255
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,274
a posh look that screams,

256
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,609
"He owns everything, henny."

257
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,912
And for your third lurk,

258
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,247
you need to design and create

259
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,918
a look that serves
Balls to the Wall Eleganza.

260
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,986
[murmuring]

261
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,855
Now, to create
your eleganza look,

262
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,058
you can play
with all these balls,

263
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,694
plus materials
from the F&S Fabrics wall.

264
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,564
I have been waiting
for a design challenge,

265
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,968
so I'm really excited
to show what I can deliver.

266
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,202
Hey, listen, I gotta bounce,

267
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,838
but, uh, gentlemen,
start your engines,

268
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,241
and may the best woman win.

269
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:50,710
[cheers and applause]

270
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,079
[sighs]
I am a little nervous.

271
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,214
You know, this is the first
design challenge we have,

272
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,651
and I've only sewn
one garment before this.

273
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,154
So just pray for me.break

274
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,426
Gimme the balls!

275
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:09,262
This week's challenge
is the Ball Ball.

276
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,531
We have three categories.

277
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,799
Our first two looks

278
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,768
can be pulled from our wardrobe
that we brought with us,

279
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,639
but the Balls to the Wall
Eleganza

280
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,209
must be constructed while
we are here from scratch.

281
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:25,211
[crash]
Oh, my God.

282
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,813
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

283
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,147
-Brita!
-Brita!

284
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:33,152
Come on, Season 12,
let's get sewing!

285
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,622
Hey, miss.
What are you doing?

286
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,658
I wanted to have
a little bit of Latin flair.

287
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,360
Mm.

288
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,362
Carmen Miranda's
a big inspiration of mine

289
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,132
because I like wearing
lots of necklaces and bracelets.

290
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:49,669
I wanted to show the judges
my Mexican side,

291
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,670
so I thought it would be fun

292
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,171
to glue a bunch of balls
to my head.

293
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,741
And I wanna look like
I'm a piñata.

294
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:56,309
Doing everything myself
is something

295
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:58,611
that I'm really proud of
when it comes to my drag.

296
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,180
I'm excited to show everyone
what I can do.

297
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,851
I'm also really excited
to see some people fail.

298
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,822
Oh, wow.

299
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,090
These were the very first things
I saw,

300
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,126
and I made sure that nobody else
was gonna get these,

301
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,094
because I have a plan.

302
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,362
I have a plan, too.

303
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,764
You got cheese balls?

304
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:18,931
-Girl.
-Just to snack on?

305
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,968
I'm gonna step on the runway
and be like...

306
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,504
My ball comes
from the voguing scene

307
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,272
in Harlem, New York,
in the eighties,

308
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,074
and it's basically categories

309
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:29,909
that you have to
portray yourself in.

310
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,811
And you have to sell
the garment, darling.

311
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,579
Miss Nicky.
So what are you doing?

312
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,349
I'm really gonna do,
like, this fringe dress.

313
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,018
But covered with those fringes,
so it's just gonna--

314
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,053
I'm gonna have, like,
a very tight structure.

315
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,054
Oh, it's just gonna move.

316
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,422
And it's gonna move on the legs.

317
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:45,258
I feel like they have been
praising me for the fashion,

318
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,392
but arriving with fashion
is good,

319
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,493
but you wanna show them

320
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,795
that you're really
part of the process,

321
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,763
and this is my attempt
to show them that I can do that.

322
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,098
Great.

323
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,801
Finally, no English needed
for that one, honey.

324
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,769
No, bitch.

325
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,738
Finally, something
that I can fucking slay.

326
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,973
I don't have to work
with bitches I don't know.

327
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,176
I'm just relying on myself.

328
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,510
This is creative,
this is fashion-forward,

329
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,578
this is what I like to do.

330
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,679
It's good
to be a good seamstress,

331
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,048
but it's better
to be a good designer.

332
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,519
I like what Nicky's doing
right now.

333
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,957
My biggest threat in this
challenge is Nicky Doll.

334
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,259
She definitely has
a concept together,

335
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,730
so I do kind of feel
a little bit of pressure on me

336
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,832
to kind of step up my game.

337
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,801
I think I'm gonna go,
like, really mod sixties

338
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,437
and just, like, add these balls
every which way.

339
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:32,839
-Whichever way you can, yeah.
-Yeah, girl.

340
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,507
Oh, bitch.

341
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,776
Since, though,
I am a seamstress,

342
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:41,080
I really pride myself on being
able to construct a garment.

343
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,682
I wanna make this
look like something

344
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,985
that was very impeccably
put together.

345
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,920
I wanna win this challenge,
you know?

346
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,225
You said you used to play
soccer, right, Jan?

347
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,627
I did. I grew up
playing soccer my entire life.

348
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,830
Does this hurt you, seeing
this soccer ball destroyed?

349
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,100
No, because it's just like
the patriarchy.

350
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,436
Oh, yes.
Tear it down, rebuild it.

351
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,705
I started playing sports
when I grew up.

352
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,041
Soccer was my number one thing,
and I played that for 13 years.

353
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,678
Growing up in a Catholic school,
it's not really great to be gay.

354
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:14,714
And because I played sports,

355
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:17,350
I think that people kind of
gave me a little bit of a pass,

356
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,852
because they thought,
oh, well, he's really athletic,

357
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,187
so he can't be that gay.

358
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,122
Like, sure.

359
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,758
But I like to call myself
the Troy Bolton of drag,

360
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,994
because, yes, I do love sports,

361
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,996
but I also love
some musical theater.

362
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,397
I love to belt it out.

363
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,368
Getting your patterns out, girl?

364
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,602
Yes'm.

365
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,738
Remember,
the neck is at the top.

366
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,740
[laughs]

367
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,210
Right now, I am freaking out.

368
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,212
Everyone is, like,
cutting fabric,

369
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,481
they have, like,
concepts laid out,

370
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:53,519
and I'm--I don't--
I have no idea what I'm doing.

371
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,221
Jackie, I got it.

372
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:56,689
I think you're done, Brita.

373
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,090
I think this is it.

374
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:01,060
I might get eliminated, though,
because I have no shape.

375
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,030
Round is a shape, actually.

376
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,364
[laughs and coughs]

377
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,699
My asthma.

378
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,436
Is that cheating if I just
wear this as a hoop skirt?

379
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,438
Pineapple Princess.

380
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,473
I could be a pineapple.
I have enough green.

381
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,843
-There you go.
-That's pretty freaking cute.

382
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,644
Now I have a concept,

383
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,747
but, like, how the fuck
am I gonna construct this?

384
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,282
Like, I don't know
what I'm doing.

385
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,684
Gigi, you sew, right?

386
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:25,985
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,587
I'm gonna need some help.

388
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:29,889
I'm freaking out a little
bit.break

389
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,428
This week's challenge
is the Ball Ball.

390
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:38,164
We're gonna have
some basketball, some football,

391
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,399
some hanging balls,
some highballs, some lowballs.

392
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,635
-Jan's got a plan.
-Blue balls.

393
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,537
I'm just ready
to play with the balls.

394
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,607
Let's go. [laughs]

395
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,250
In order to make the look
that I've envisioned,

396
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,853
I'm gonna go with this method
that we use for cosplay.

397
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,890
You create a cast of your body

398
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,492
using tights and some duct tape.

399
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,029
Crrrrk!

400
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,130
Crrrrk!

401
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,865
Who wrapping gifts over there?

402
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,369
Rock M., what are you doing?

403
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,405
The roll's too loud!
I can't hear you!

404
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,476
When you wrap all this duct tape
around your body,

405
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,478
it'll hold
the shape of your body

406
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,613
and then it'll become
the base of my outfit.

407
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,816
Ah, she's free!

408
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,287
My goal is to put as many balls
as possible on this dress,

409
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,556
and to really impress the judges

410
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:40,293
with just how big
my outfit is gonna be.

411
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,595
I need more duct tape.

412
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:46,132
Someone that I'm concerned
for is Rock M.

413
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,668
I'm very confused
on what's going on.

414
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:52,538
It looks like a science fair
project gone wrong.

415
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,878
We're all still hustling,

416
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,179
we're all still trying to think
how can we make this better?

417
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,480
How can we top ourselves?

418
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,717
How do we turn this
from an outfit to an eleganza?

419
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,419
So, friends, what do we think

420
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,154
the judges are actually
looking for in this challenge?

421
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:11,557
It has to read ball,
but scream high fashion.

422
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,693
-Exactly.
-Just walk down the runway,

423
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,329
and you scream "high fashion"
at the top of your lungs.

424
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,463
High fashion!

425
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,664
This is high fashion!

426
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,099
Balenciaga!

427
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,301
Screaming high fashion
right now.

428
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,804
Wow. [laughs]

429
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:27,606
The concept for my
Balls to the Wall Eleganza look

430
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,309
is a beautiful white gown.

431
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,578
There's more white balls
somewhere.

432
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,580
Normally, I'm not the type

433
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,148
to be running around
playing with white balls.

434
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,351
But for this look,
I'm gonna have to get my hands

435
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,186
on as many white balls as I can.

436
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:43,289
♪ She's gonna need
a bunch of popcorn balls ♪

437
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,490
♪ To make it through ♪

438
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,660
♪ She's gonna take
some wiffle balls ♪

439
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,928
♪ To make it through ♪

440
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,330
Jaida's got this white gown
going on.

441
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,201
I don't think
it's a cute bottom of it.

442
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:58,304
It kind of disconnects
a little bit.

443
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,139
She was gonna be a lovely gown,

444
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:05,378
but, darling, major issues
I'm running into at this moment.

445
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:10,816
My original idea
is to make this beautiful gown.

446
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,519
But I just realized that
there are not enough white balls

447
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,522
to do exactly what it is
that I want to do.

448
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,725
So right now my heart
is palpitating shit.

449
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,394
I don't know what the hell
is going on.

450
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,529
A bitch is going through
a little bit of panicking.

451
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,464
Bitch, this might
have to be a leotard.

452
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,972
I'm sewing my base garment,

453
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,374
and then I realize, oh, my God,

454
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,244
I just spent so much time
making this stupid base.

455
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,278
Like, oh, my God,
I'm running out of time

456
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,446
to put these balls on it.

457
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,747
And, oh, my God,
am I gonna have time

458
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,849
to make this dress
come to fruition?

459
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,418
The stress is setting in.

460
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,354
I have to cover
this whole thing in balls,

461
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,424
and I've already spent hours
just making a white dress.

462
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,626
Oh, I hope it's enough.

463
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:55,528
Other girls have
half-finished garments,

464
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,197
so I feel kind of fucked
right now.

465
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,237
I'm really enjoying
this black-and-white theme.

466
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,707
My look is turning into sort of
a pinup kind of moment.

467
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,277
I'm honestly loving
what I'm creating.

468
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,246
The only thing about mine
is I'm just, as of now,

469
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,116
hoping it's not too simple,
maybe.

470
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,222
[clucks tongue]

471
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,464
I am racking my brain,

472
00:20:31,464 --> 00:20:34,300
trying to find ways
to zhuzh up this outfit.

473
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,303
[hums]

474
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:40,506
But I am feeling like
if I add anything else,

475
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,308
it's going to lose shape,
it's going to lose meaning.

476
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,744
And one thing I don't wanna do

477
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,013
is walk down that runway
looking like a mess.

478
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,982
Like I said, I know
it's, like, more simple.

479
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,383
Mm-hmm.

480
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,651
But that's, like,
generally my drag.

481
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,355
I'm most worried for Aiden.

482
00:20:56,355 --> 00:21:02,128
It's a two-colored corset
with a couple of droopy balls.

483
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,164
[nervous chuckle]

484
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,732
It's not necessarily about--

485
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,901
-Having to have the most on.
-Having it be the most, yeah.

486
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,469
It's if you have
a strong concept.

487
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,204
This is, like, referee.

488
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,006
It fits perfectly
with the sports theme.

489
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,876
I didn't even
think of that, yeah.

490
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,078
Bitch, you didn't know
that you were creating

491
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,648
a pinstriped
white and black costume

492
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,083
that resembles a referee?

493
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,185
It's a ball challenge.

494
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,653
Girl, what?

495
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:28,954
I'm trying to think
if I have a whistle

496
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,089
that could go with that.

497
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,891
That would be hilarious.

498
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,761
Jan has pointed out that
it sort of reads as referee,

499
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,663
and it's this sort of
lightbulb moment

500
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:41,333
that's just adding another layer
of confidence on my outfit.

501
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,502
I think I might
be pretty much done.

502
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,773
Aiden is done working on it,

503
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,043
and isn't really
going the extra mile

504
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:55,114
to see if there's anything else
that he can add to the
look.break

505
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,960
Woop, woop, woop, woop.

506
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,895
It's time to get ready
for the ball.

507
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,264
Yesterday
I just wasn't really sure

508
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,532
if this dress
was going to come together

509
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,767
the way that I wanted it to,

510
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:18,370
but last night I was able
to work on my dress,

511
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,105
so this morning
I've just decided

512
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:23,909
to hike up my panties
and make it fucking work.

513
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,812
[laughs] Oh, my gosh.

514
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,981
Get your inches!

515
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,517
Nicky, we gotta put our wigs on.

516
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,885
Okay, let's see
who has the best human hair.

517
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,387
One, two, three.

518
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,622
Oh, yeah.

519
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,791
You just slapped me
with your hair, bitch!

520
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:39,825
Well, that's what happens

521
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:42,127
when you have
this much volume, Nicky.

522
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,231
Too much volume. Real.

523
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,066
The problem that Nicky is having
in this competition

524
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,034
is that she's not
letting the judges

525
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,636
see the goofy side
that we all see.

526
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,971
I feel like Ellen DeGeneres.

527
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,172
[all laugh]

528
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,640
And that's not gonna bode
very well for her.

529
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,576
How you feeling, Miss Heidi?

530
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,011
I'm feeling good.

531
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,646
My vision
kind of came together.

532
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:01,680
It's really cool.

533
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,716
It's very clean.
I love the lines.

534
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,785
I didn't want it to just be
a bunch of balls everywhere.

535
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,554
[laughs]

536
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,923
I wanted--I wanted--

537
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,024
Good thing she's on the other
side of the room right now.

538
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,025
I wanted them to be, like--

539
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,426
Miss Thing.

540
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,328
I wanted them to be
meticulously placed.

541
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,830
Uh-huh, I see.

542
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,032
The shade starts this week.

543
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,502
Rock M.'s garment could use
a little bit of editing.

544
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,671
It's a little too...

545
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:28,607
It is balls to the wall,
and that it is,

546
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:32,845
very balls to the, mm, wall.

547
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:33,979
[tongue pop]

548
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,484
With the challenge,
I feel like

549
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,852
I really, like, turned it.

550
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,920
Anybody else, like,
really happy with what they did?

551
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,789
Aiden, how well do you feel?

552
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,024
Because I know you had,
like, a lot of time left

553
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:46,292
between what you did.

554
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,093
Yeah, I was the first one done
out of everybody.

555
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,731
So last night, while I'm, like,
struggling to finish this dress,

556
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,001
Aiden is over here
in the corner taking a nap.

557
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,704
She took the least
amount of time on her look,

558
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:01,573
and she was on the couch
sleeping.

559
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,642
Aiden isn't working hard enough.

560
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,011
I'm actually really happy,
like, with what I made.

561
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,480
I think it's, like, totally me.

562
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,481
Don't you think you
could have added more to it

563
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,482
with, like, the extra time?

564
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,483
-Because, like--
-No.

565
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,653
I think if I had
added anything else,

566
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,756
it would have pulled away from
the vision that I have for it.

567
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,158
-Okay.
-And like I said,

568
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,126
I do tend to have sometimes

569
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,162
a "less is more"
kind of aesthetic.

570
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:26,265
My face is something
that I use to kind of pull--

571
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,667
like, bring my looks together,
if that makes sense.

572
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,703
But don't you feel like
this is gonna be an issue

573
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:31,904
in front of the judges,

574
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,605
when it's a fashion ball
and not a face category?

575
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,809
Well, I'm not
just going down there

576
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,810
with my face painted and naked.

577
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,311
Nicky: No, no, no, for sure.

578
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,046
This is an eleganza challenge,

579
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:44,516
and to me, that means
do as much as you can

580
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,885
and be as creative as possible.

581
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,021
There's a lot of shit
you can do to spice it up.

582
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,523
Well, somebody's
going home today.

583
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,625
Shit done got real, honey.

584
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,830
Come on, Sakura.

585
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,199
I live for this mug.
This is so nice.

586
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,533
Ooh, thank you.

587
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,268
I first started doing
Sakura face

588
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,738
because the first time
I ever started in drag,

589
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,340
someone told me, oh,
it must be really easy for you

590
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,508
because you're Asian.

591
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,643
And, like, you don't
have to try very hard.

592
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,545
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

593
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,514
They're like, you don't have to
try very hard at all, do you?

594
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,983
And I was like,
I'll show you who's not trying.

595
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,151
And so I just started

596
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,388
putting more and more
and more makeup on.

597
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,056
The fact that people think

598
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:26,258
that Asian queens
don't have to try too hard

599
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:29,995
because they already
look like women

600
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,198
or they're highly feminized
really got to me.

601
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,401
So I started to look like

602
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:37,603
I was at least
trying hard with my makeup.

603
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:40,739
But now that I paint so bold,

604
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:44,777
all I ever hear is, wow,
you're giving me Trixie makeup.

605
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,012
Wow, you're giving me
Kim Chi makeup.

606
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,115
But the thing is I've been
drawing anime-ish styles,

607
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:51,683
I had that
How to Draw Manga book

608
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,419
ever since I was a little kid.

609
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:56,622
And a lot of people do this
style and have done it before.

610
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,524
Sakura, you took it
to a whole other level.

611
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:00,692
I'm a lady now.

612
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,595
Just like you girls.

Now, do you play any sports?

No, my doctor doesn't want me
doing any activities

624
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,509
that involve balls
flying at my face.

Well, I don't wanna brag,
but in college,

Imagine Ariana Grande,

702
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,141
but instead of a ponytail,
she had a tetherball braid.

703
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:38,143
I'm gonna rope them in

to all of these super-crazy
talented girls

715
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,468
who work really hard
on the court,

716
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,704
and they don't get the shine
that they deserve.

717

but black queens sure can strut.

This is a slam-dunk, though.

724

737
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,477
I worked in the basement
of a bowling alley,

738
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,746
and I know
a lot of old bowlers.

739
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,448
I've got cute little glasses

740
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:51,616

and give Michelle a wink,

741
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,618

but she's really
just gonna go for putt-putt.

is just about a feel
that you give.

853
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:10,442
Like when you see a woman and
she just looks pulled together,

854
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,910
that's a basketball wife.

855
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,945
I mean, look, my man
do not play basketball,

Her husband gave her

00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,806
She is a Blade Runner fantasy

I'm having a cocktail
in the sunset in Brazil.

947
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,094
And I'm going all fringe dress,

948
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:52,730
but I'm bringing
a little French twist to it

949
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,200
by adding extra hips,
so very Marie Antoinette like.

950
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,635
RuPaul: Michelle, is there
an anal bead option?

951

957
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,814
Aiden: I am serving you
a little bit of Bettie Page,

958
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,784
but I'm also giving you
the nod to a referee.

959
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,353
I am loving this
black-and-white color scheme.

960
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,990
I've got my whistle, so
don't you dare commit a foul.

961
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,825
RuPaul:
What's in this season?

962
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:22,160

Leslie: What is
that thing called

968
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,102
that you jump in
with all the balls in it?

969
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,103
Michelle: A ball pit.

970
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,238
[all laugh]

971
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:35,173
Rock: They said
"dripping with balls,"

972
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,376
so I dragged balls
all over this outfit.

973
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,813
I have every color
you could possibly imagine.

974
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,215
It doesn't exactly make
too much sense,

975
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,150
but it looks visually appealing.

976
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:49,921
Michelle: This is what
it looks like when the cat wins.

977
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,656

have took that LSD, you guys.

Jaida: Bitch,
I'm really excited,

983
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,034
because my look
turned out amazing.

984
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,936
It's giving me
this rich bitch fantasy,

985
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,472
dipped in a beautiful,
sudsy, foamy bubble bath.

986
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,942
And I just feel the fantasy
sweeping over me.

I'm giving you
my pineapple crown.

996
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,594
A beautiful, tight pencil skirt

998
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,832
and pineapple tidbits
on my shoes.

999
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,935
I got my pineapple powder puff

1000
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,370
that I'm wiping
the oil on my nose with,

1001
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,441
because she is just oozing
of pineapple juice, honey.

1002
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,643
Ross: Corn?

1003
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:47,845
Is it corn?
Is it a pineapple?

1004
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,113
-It's a pineapple.
-Oh.

1005
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,214
Is that a pineapple?

1006
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,349
Yeah, it's supposed to be
a pineapple.

1012
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,892
inspired by Carmen Miranda.

1013
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,694
She's one of my favorite
style inspirations.

1014
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:05,496
She's always wearing
the most amount of accessories,

1015
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,665
and I really appreciate that
in a woman.

1016

Michelle: You know,
the last time

1017

1050
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,644
Leslie: Run, Forrest, run!

1051
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,413
[all laugh]

1052
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,648
RuPaul: Widow Von'Du.

1053
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:35,119
This is what the fashionable
are wearing in Machu Picchu.

1054
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,554
Michelle: Yes.

1055
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,390
Widow:
My Balls to the Wall Eleganza

1056
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,193
kind of looks like
Wakanda Forever

1057
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,562
and Christmas
with Cindy Lou Who.

1058
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,632
And a bitch gots a ponytail.

1059
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:50,201
Ross; Yellow?
It's your shoes.

1060
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:53,704
[all laugh]

1061
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,072
Leslie: No!

1062
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,074
You can't do that to me, no!

1063
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,476
RuPaul: Gigi Goode.

1064
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:01,245
Silly rabbit.
Trix are for kids.

1065
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,547
Ross: Now with drag berries.

1066
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,782
[all laugh]

1067
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,786
Gigi: I am so proud
of what I came up with.

1068
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,255
It has a cute little
box-pleated skirt,

1069
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,790
puffy little pirate sleeves,

1070
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,792
and, yes, bitch,
there's a zipper.

1071
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:16,994
No one else in this challenge

1072
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,597
has made a look
as elaborate as mine.

1073
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,399
Leslie: I got
a pocket full of quarters.

1074
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,234
I want some of them gumballs.

1075
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,236
RuPaul: Young and full of gum.

1076
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:26,737
[all laugh]

1077
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,372
Young and full of gum!break

1078
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,441
RuPaul: Welcome, ladies.

1079
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:35,112
Based on
your 36 Ball Ball looks,

1080
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,714
I've made some decisions.

1081
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,286
Jackie Cox.

1082
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,922
Crystal Methyd.

1083
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,158
Jan.

1084
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:48,159
Heidi.

1085
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,760
Sherry Pie.

1086
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:51,996
The Widow Von'Du.

1087
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:55,666
Ladies, you're safe.

1088
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,203
You may...bounce.

1089
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:01,572
[all laugh]

1090
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:07,979
You represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1091
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,682
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1092
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:14,285
starting with Nicky Doll.

1093
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,387
This is a fashion challenge.

1094
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:19,557
I expected a lot from you,
and you delivered.

1095
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:22,059
In your first look,
the Lady Ballers,

1096
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,561
you heard of fantasy football?

1097
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:24,729
You were my football fantasy.

1098
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,697
-Ooh!
-Basketball Wives realness,

1099
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,366
girl, you worked that.

1100
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,102
On your Balls to the Wall
realness,

1101
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:32,203
I think this is fun.

1102
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,237
It's a corset with a panty,

1103
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,705
but you threw
a lot of stuff on it

1104
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,408
that brought us into,
like, a fantasy.

1105
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,176
The color palette is perfect.

1106
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,345
-Thank you.
-There's a lot of whimsy in it.

1107
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,614
My favorite part is what
you've done with the hips,

1108
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,817
because it gave you a shape.

1109
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,019
We know that you have
a nice aesthetic,

1110
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,353
but I'm gonna challenge you

1111
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,588
to keep pushing
that personality up.

1112
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,256
Get out here and be a fool.

1113
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,526
[sighs] I understand completely
what you mean.

1114
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:59,463
I think it is hard to really
understand my personality,

1115
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,766
and it's up to me
to deliver it to you.

1116
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:06,604
What's the wackiest
you've ever been in your life?

1117
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:09,607
I'm always wacky.

1118
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:10,975
That's the most
frustrating part.

1119
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,410
Make an ugly face right now.

1120
00:45:13,578 --> 00:45:15,379
Yeah!
[all laugh]

1121
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,014
-Thank you, Nicky.
-Merci.

1122
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,816
Up next, Aiden Zhane.

1123
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,118
Lady Baller was adorable.

1124
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,788
It was perfectly
in the right era,

1125
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,256
which I really appreciated
and loved.

1126
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,758
You hit a home run
in the first inning.

1127
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,193
-You guys follow me?
-Very good.

1128
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,128
What is that?
Is that baseball?

1129
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,129
Oh, my gosh!

1130
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,332
And then your team
had a drought.

1131
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:36,434
Basketball Wives realness,

1132
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,136
it looked just like
minor leagues.

1133
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,504
And again, with this last look,

1134
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:43,574
the execution isn't as polished
as it needs to be.

1135
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,476
This is not
going to be enough, Aiden,

1136
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,779
because this is a corset
with cotton balls on it.

1137
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,581
My drag sometimes
does tend to maybe have

1138
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,784
a little bit of a less is more,
maybe, thing about it.

1139
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,953
I'm not always the girl
who puts everything on.

1140
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,656
Yeah, it doesn't have to always
be more, more, more.

1141
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,157
It just has to have
a consciousness behind it

1142
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:04,061
that says, "I am here,
and I have something to say."

1143
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:06,197
You've got it, kiddo.

1144
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,933
Now spread those wings
and what?

1145
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,268
♪ Fly ♪

1146
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,571
Up next, Rock M. Sakura.

1147
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:15,072
Hi, hi.

1148
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,943
In all three of your looks,
your hair and makeup, girl.

1149
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,978
That tetherball,
when you came out

1150
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,279
and swung that thing
around your neck,

1151
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,514
I was like, oh, that's dope.

1152
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,883
The problem was
there was nothing exciting

1153
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,351
going on below the ball.

1154
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:29,453
For your Basketball Wife
realness look,

1155
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,721
I thought you looked
really beautiful.

1156
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,590
There was just an issue
with the padding.

1157
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,492
It was a little disjointed.
Mm, mm, mm.

1158
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:37,561
Now, this look, it takes a lot
of balls to wear that look.

1159
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:38,896
[all laugh]

1160
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:40,865
We were just saying, Aiden,

1161
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:42,933
that sometimes
more, more, more is not right,

1162
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,002
and I'm gonna use you
as an example.

1163
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:47,271
I feel like maybe
every single thing

1164
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,606
that you could have
gotten your hands on

1165
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:49,907
is on your body right now.

1166
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,842
And then the chest
is very far open,

1167
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,545
and it almost looks like
you have sores on your chest.

1168
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,647
Sometimes you do need to edit.

1169
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,882
Imagine, if you could,

1170
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,617
a world where you
cut the dress off at the knees.

1171
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:00,751
That would have been chic.

1172
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,319
That hair and makeup, dope.

1173
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,822
Just, you gotta bring
the outfits now to match that.

1174
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,559
Up next, Jaida Essence Hall.

1175
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,328
Girl, I've played basketball
since the sixth grade.

1176
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,897
You cannot play.

1177
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,131
[all laugh]

1178
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,499
You cannot play, girl.

1179
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:17,134
But you know what?

1180
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,537
I would still pick you on
my team, 'cause you looked fly.

1181
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,572
I was like, oh, my God.

1182
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,341
The second look,
the first thing I thought about

1183
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,242
was Porsha
from Atlanta Housewives.

1184
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,577
Yes.

1185
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,678
You were living
the rich fantasy,

1186
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,381
and tonight,
this is really fun.

1187
00:47:30,381 --> 00:47:32,817
This is the glamorous woman
taking a bath.

1188
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:35,119
She so rich,
she bathes in diamonds.

1189
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,688
Yeah, I mean,
the proportions are fantastic,

1190
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,657
and it's really beautiful.

1191
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:40,891
Thank you so much.

1192
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,094
I think I would change
the same thing

1193
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:45,763
about all three
of your looks tonight:

1194
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:46,764
not a damn thing.

1195
00:47:46,764 --> 00:47:49,133
Thank you.

1196
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,935
Up next, the great Brita.

1197
00:47:50,935 --> 00:47:52,570
We're gonna start
with your Lady Ballers.

1198
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,038
You chose baseball.

1199
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:57,007
I thought it was really fun, the
puffy kind of baseball sleeves.

1200
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,543
The baseball socks, they were
kind of a little loose,

1201
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,811
so they were kind of baggy.

1202
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,046
The Basketball Wives,
it didn't have

1203
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:05,149
that kind of "I'm married
to a baller" vibe to it.

1204
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,284
It was just kind of
clubby pedestrian.

1205
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,787
This look, I'm still confused.

1206
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,188
Like, is it corn,
is it a pineapple,

1207
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,189
is it a cornapple?

1208
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:13,357
It's a pineapple.

1209
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,458
What you talking 'bout, Willis?

1210
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,193
Because that is not a pineapple.

1211
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,228
It's a pineapple.

1212
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,130
No, I say, no!

1213
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,765
[all laugh]

1214
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,899
My family lives in Hawaii.

1215
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,435
My mom calls my sisters
"pineapple princesses,"

1216
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,670
so I wanted to be one, too.

1217
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,006
I just love your energy.

1218
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,775
I think
that is so beautiful

1219
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:32,543
that your family calls you
little pineapples and cute.

1220
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:35,579
But listen, if you're telling
a story, we should get it.

1221
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,681
We shouldn't wonder,
"Is it a corn?"

1222
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,283
If you have a vision

1223
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,384
and we don't know
what the hell's going on,

1224
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,919
you did not execute your vision.

1225
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,054
Up next, Gigi Goode.

1226
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,190
Your first look
was a Heathers moment,

1227
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,394
with the croquet, and
it was gorgeous and fabulous.

1228
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:51,962
I mean, there's nothing sexier

1229
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,397
than a woman in a blazer,
I think.

1230
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,733
Maybe because
they look most like a man.

1231
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,301
[all laugh]

1232
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,602
The Basketball Wives,

1233
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,038
the snake print with the collar
up and the black hair,

1234
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,140
I'm partial to black hair.

1235
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,576
Can I just say that I wanna eat
your hair right now?

1236
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,011
It looks delicious.

1237
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:08,379
And it's all mine.

1238
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:09,580
That was funny.
Tell another one.

1239
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,516
[all laugh]

1240
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,352
This look, it's perfection.

1241
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:16,687
Thank you so much.

1242
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,889
It's exciting, and it's chic.

1243
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,925
It's like you've been studying
this for a very long time,

1244
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,226
which I actually think
you probably have been.

1245
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,728
My mom is a seamstress.

1246
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,831
She's taught me
everything that I know.

1247
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,599
She's made, like, most
of the looks that I brought,

1248
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,335
and she does not give herself
enough credit.

1249
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,170
And she means the world to me.

1250
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:34,972
Honestly, the biggest reason
that I'm here

1251
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,141
is to make my mom proud.

1252
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,210
And your mom is proud. Trust.

1253
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,111
Thank you so much.

1254
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,347
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1255
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:45,549
While you untuck backstage,

1256
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,118
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1257
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,822
All right, now,
just between us ball queens,

1258
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,324
what do you think?

1259
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:54,859
Nicky Doll.

1260
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:56,427
Nicky is a fashion queen,

1261
00:49:56,427 --> 00:50:00,231
and she served us fashion
in every single look.

1262
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,399
What's missing for me
is the personality.

1263
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,601
I don't know anything about her,

1264
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,369
apart from the fact
that she's French.

1265
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,471
I'm rooting for her, because
I think she does have it.

1266
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,839
I love the aesthetic.

1267
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,943
What I need for her to do
is work from the inside out.

1268
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:15,412
You know, she's got
the outside working.

1269
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:16,981
That's good, girl.

1270
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,582
Aiden Zhane.

1271
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,451
Where Nicky Doll
is lacking in kooky,

1272
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:23,821
Aiden Zhane has plenty of kooky
to go around.

1273
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:26,857
Her first look was amazing,
but no, no, no,

1274
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,093
you are not putting on
a pair of panties and a corset

1275
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,362
and trying to pass that off
as a look to me.

1276
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,531
Aiden's such an original,

1277
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,299
but I worry
that she's overwhelmed.

1278
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:38,202
What she's gonna have to do
is get her head out of her ass

1279
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:40,738
and put on some blinders
and go for it.

1280
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:42,706
It's about channeling
that energy to fuel you

1281
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,707
rather than to fear you.

1282
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,842
Exactly. Thank you.

1283
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,443
Rock M. Sakura.

1284
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,978
You know, when Rock M.
first came around the corner

1285
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,280
with her Lady Ballers outfit,

1286
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,250
I saw her face and I was like,
ooh, she looks gorgeous.

1287
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,020
And then my eyes panned down.

1288
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,488
[laughs]

1289
00:50:57,488 --> 00:50:59,857
She's the only queen who really
gave us a show with the balls,

1290
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,292
you know what I mean?

1291
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,794
And if she did that in the club,
people would go crazy for it.

1292
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:04,895
Yeah, they would.

1293
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,130
It was a fun concept,

1294
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,299
but it wasn't enough
to make the outfit great.

1295
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:09,867
And then her final look tonight

1296
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,836
was probably my least favorite
on that runway.

1297
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,640
The outfit was just not good.

1298
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,776
It looks like cats
just lost they mind.

1299
00:51:18,776 --> 00:51:21,312
Yeah.
[all laugh]

1300
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:23,280
Jaida Essence Hall.

1301
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,715
I loved Jaida tonight.

1302
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:26,650
She was just gorgeous.

1303
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,320
The Balls to the Wall
extravaganza was my favorite.

1304
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,754
She just looked so glamorous,

1305
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,990
and I just thought
she was a star tonight.

1306
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,092
Three points for Jaida.

1307
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,160
Is that a basketball term?

1308
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,461
That's a basketball term,
thank you!

1309
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,595
-It is, three-pointer.
-Three pointer, that's a thing?

1310
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,297
Yeah, it's a thing.

1311
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:41,365
Thank you!

1312
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:42,733
All right, up next, Brita.

1313
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,802
I love her energy,
it's infectious.

1314
00:51:44,802 --> 00:51:46,236
I just think that tonight

1315
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:47,905
was a little bit of a miss
for Miss Brita.

1316
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:49,807
What was she pulling out
of her mouth at the beginning?

1317
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:52,142
I don't know what it was.
Chewing gum?

1318
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:54,244
I can't get past this.

1319
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:55,379
If you're auditioning
for a musical

1320
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:56,647
and they say
come with three numbers,

1321
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,182
you don't do
the same number twice.

1322
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,316
-Right, right, right.
-Right.

1323
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,819
And she wore essentially
two yellow dresses.

1324
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:02,820
She's better than that.

1325
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,221
Yeah, yeah.

1326
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,622
And then I had to look up
a pineapple,

1327
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,391
because I was like, that is not
what a pineapple look like.

1328
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,059
The only thing worse
than not knowing you ate corn

1329
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,761
is not even knowing
you're eating corn.

1330
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:11,929
[all laugh]

1331
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,398
It's hard to digest,
and so were her looks.

1332
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,399
[all laugh]

1333
00:52:15,399 --> 00:52:18,535
Damn! Damn!

1334
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,137
All right, let's move on now
to Gigi Goode.

1335
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,640
Not only was each look
better than the last,

1336
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,011
but with each look that she
showed us, there was a story.

1337
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,278
That's what fashion should do.

1338
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,314
She's so perfect, she almost
looks like a mannequin.

1339
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,317
Like if I walked into a store
and saw this mannequin,

1340
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,985
I'd be like,
where is the salesperson?

1341
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,287
I want this outfit now!

1342
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,555
She's a sample size.

1343
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,924
But take away the body,

1344
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:44,561
and you still have fabulous,
gorgeous clothes

1345
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:48,932
with texture and storyline
and a consciousness behind it.

1346
00:52:48,932 --> 00:52:51,101
Just fabulous.

1347
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,737
Gigi Goode
was a triple threat tonight.

1348
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:57,307
All right. Silence.
I've made my decision.

1349
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,843
Bring back my girls.break

1350
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:02,546
RuPaul: Welcome back, ladies.

1351
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,715
I've made some decisions.

1352
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,921
Nicky Doll,
you look magnifique.

1353
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,625
Now show us your freak.

1354
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,294
You're safe.

1355
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:19,663
You may join the other girls.

1356
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,570
Jaida Essence Hall.

1357
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,239
Girl, you really cleaned up
this week.

1358
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,441
Thank you.

1359
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,910
You are safe.

1360
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,845
Thank you so much.

1361
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,784
Gigi. Tonight you weren't
just good, you were great.

1362
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:42,986
Con-drag-ulations.

1363
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,521
You're the winner
of this week's challenge.

1364
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:46,990
[applause]

1365
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,358
Thank you so much.

1366
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,929
And you've won
a cash prize of $5.000.

1367
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:53,931
-Yes!
-Nice!

1368
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:56,266
I feel so incredible.

1369
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,902
I feel like I secured my place
in this competition,

1370
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:02,439
and I let every last one
of these bitches know

1371
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,440
who to look out for.

1372
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:09,513
Aiden Zhane, you're in a league
of your own,

1373
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,116
but tonight on the runway
you made a bad call.

1374
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:16,086
Rock M., I like
that you take risks,

1375
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:20,257
but tonight it was
a bit of a swing and a miss.

1376
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:24,928
Brita, you're a sweet
pineapple princess,

1377
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,765
but tonight you didn't crush it.

1378
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,172
Aiden Zhane.

1379
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:37,207
You're safe.

1380
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,579
You may join the other girls.

1381
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,014
Bitch.

1382
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,482
Oh, my God.

1383
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,284
Bitch, too bad.

1384
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,419
I'm safe. End of story.

1385
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:52,756
Rock M. and Brita,
I'm sorry, my dears,

1386
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,792
but you're up
for elimination.

1387
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,927
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1388
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:00,864
I take a deep breath, and I say
if you wanna be here, you fight.

1389
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,667
[mouthing words]

1390
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,871
Look at her. Oh, my God,
this is gonna be good.

1391
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:11,074
My arrogant ass thought that
I wasn't going to lip sync.

1392
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,343
