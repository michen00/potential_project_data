RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,442
We're playing the Snatch Game.

3
00:00:08,442 --> 00:00:09,977
[cheering]

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:12,779
What's up, bitch?
[all laugh]

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:16,116
Own it, baby! Own it!

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:19,119
I do not understand
the rules of the damn game.

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,091
Brita.

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,593
It was just one note
that went nowhere.

9
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,694
Aiden Zhane.

10
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,162
When you say, "I don't know,"

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,298
it's a full-stop dead-end for
whoever's performing with you.

12
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,766
Gigi Goode.

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,802
You landed all the jokes, and
I thought that was brilliant.

14
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,105
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

15
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,506
[applause]
Yes!

16
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:42,876
-Brita, shantay you stay.
-Thank you.

17
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,679
Aiden, sashay away.

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,882
Aah!

19
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,959
Back, back, back again.
[sighs]

20
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,695
-Oh, my God.
-Aiden.

21
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:06,066
Dear Aiden,
my small-town sister girl.

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,735
Oh.

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,073
"You may not know me now,
but you sure will later."

24
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,577
I know that she
had been feeling pressure

25
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:19,313
of some of the girls
coming at her,

26
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,714
but she has a personality.

27
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,316
It just didn't get to come out.

28
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,317
I love Aiden.

29
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:24,651
She stuck with it.

30
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,253
She certainly did.

31
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,788
I'm proud of that bitch.

32
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:30,524
Once again...

33
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:34,928
you can just taste
the fakeness in the air.

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,730
We love you, Aiden Zhane!

35
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,166
-I love you!
-Love!

36
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,567
Everybody wants to act like

37
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,337
they actually
gave a shit about Aiden.

38
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,072
You all wanted her gone.

39
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:49,843
My name is Aiden Zhane,
and I have one thing to say!

40
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,412
Can somebody tell me when this
turned into Best Friend Race?

41
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,314
Because back
in Untucked, bitch,

42
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,950
I guess y'all had a lot to say,
but now you don't.

43
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,053
[coughs]

44
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,955
Okay, so look, you all.

45
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,957
Untucked was fucked up.

46
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,426
Feel like we got
a lot of unresolved issues,

47
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,129
but, child, it's over with now.

48
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,099
Fuck that bullshit.

49
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,034
Y'all gonna have to call me
the umpire,

50
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:16,503
because, bitch, I'm about
to call these bitches out.

51
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,972
I just have one question.
During Untucked,

52
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,308
Gigi, I don't understand
why you pointed out

53
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,744
that I haven't really improved
in makeup-wise.

54
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,145
You're a sickening performer,

55
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,481
but the judges have told you
week after week

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,983
that you have to improve
on your face.

57
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,486
It came out of nowhere,
and it was like, damn, bitch.

58
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,688
It came across very,
like, she's an ugly bitch,

59
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,157
and fuck my drag
and fuck my face.

60
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,027
Okay, well, first of all,
I never said you were ugly,

61
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,796
and I never would
because you're not. Okay?

62
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:46,033
Second of all, I regret the way
that it came out of my mouth.

63
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,201
Some of you
had brought up the fact

64
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,103
that you didn't understand
why you were in the bottom.

65
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,205
I was just pointing out
why they weren't seeing them,

66
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,141
and I know
what you're about to say.

67
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,043
-I've never said--
-Listen, Heidi, I'm--

68
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,411
Go for it.

69
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,414
I've never said I didn't know
why I was in the bottom.

70
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,183
I really respect you
and what you do.

71
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,219
I respect you, but I lost
some respect for you today.

72
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,554
That's all I gotta say.

73
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,691
Okay. Well, I've spoken
my piece. I'm sorry.

74
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,993
I appreciate you spoke
your piece. Thank you.

75
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,495
-Oh, God, girls.
-Child.

76
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,564
It is what it is.
Like, I failed in the challenge.

77
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,833
I did not need y'all
to come in there

78
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,435
and stab a bitch in the back
about it.

79
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,736
This is the challenge

80
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,972
that we had the most time
to prepare for.

81
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,474
Yes, we fucking know.

82
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,843
But sometimes, in the fucking
moment, you can't be prepared.

83
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:30,911
You freeze up.

84
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,312
Y'all could have said it
way differently.

85
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,713
Yes, I'm still in my feelings
about it.

86
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,948
I'm gonna be
in my feelings about it.

87
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,516
It is what it is.

88
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,018
I'm sorry that
we were poking you guys.

89
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,653
We shouldn't be kicking you
when you're down.

90
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,589
I apologize for anybody's
feelings that were hurt.

91
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:46,660
I hate a backtracking-ass bitch.
I really do.

92
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,031
Because now they're
trying to apolo-lie...graphic

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,434
For what they said.

94
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,969
Yeah, we can question each other

95
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,838
when you know that someone
could probably do better.

96
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,239
But we know that when
we should do that.

97
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,440
-The right time.
-The right time.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,142
Bitch, we haven't had
a dance challenge yet,

99
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,543
and I'm sure
we're gonna be dancing soon.

100
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,779
And then I hope you all feel
the exact same way

101
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,180
that we feel
that we're in the bottom

102
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,715
when you all
don't do just as well.

103
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,818
Because when y'all fall, I hope
that somebody tears y'all down

104
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,553
just as much as y'all
tore us down. I'm sorry.

105
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,090
Oh.

106
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,126
He's saying that
I'm sorry for what I said

107
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,560
and the way I said it.
That means nothing to you?

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,761
You're like,
"Well, then screw you.

109
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,130
I hope you fall
in the next challenge"?

110
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,331
This ain't
RuPaul's Best Friend Race.

111
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,133
At the end of the goddamn day,

112
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,267
it's me, myself, and I.

113
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,669
And on that note,
I'm getting out of drag.

114
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,770
-Bye, y'all.
-Ooh, child.

115
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,539
Five, six, seven, eight.
Don't go on seven.

116
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:36,543
Well, that took a turn
for the wicked.

117
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,812
We couldn't just be
Best Friend Race

118
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,113
for the whole season, could we?

119
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,517
I'm really over today.
I'm... mmm.

120
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,285
Buckle up, bitches.

121
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,720
It's about to be
a bumpy-ass ride.

122
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,091
Love and peace for everybody.

123
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,495

Good morning, Miss Goode.

134
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,059
It is a brand-new day,

135
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,528
and I'm excited for what
the day's going to bring.

136

Child, so I'm excited
for a new day.

Hey, the past is in the past.
Let it go.

00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,509
-Okay.
-Aha.

141
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,948
You can cut the tension
with a goddamn butter knife.

142
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:50,884
Not even a warm
butter knife.

143
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,687
Just a cold-ass butter knife.

144
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,189
Hello, hello, hello!

145
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,525
[cheering]

146
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,028
Ladies, there are
all kinds of queens:

147
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,566
pageant queens, comedy queens,
ball queens.

148
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,203
But there is only one
queen of pop.

149
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,839
That's Madonna, bitch.

150
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,474
[cheering]

151
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,410
From her music
to her humanitarian work

152
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,615
to her early support of AIDS
education and prevention,

153
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:26,086
Madonna has been a fearless
and unapologetic trailblazer.

154
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,520
I love Madonna.

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,023
The bitch is a vibe,
and she's always serving you,

156
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,524
like, raw energy, sex,

157
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,627
and just always a fucking
fun time all around.

158
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,929
Now for this week's
maxi-challenge,

159
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:37,797
you get to pay tribute

160
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:42,769
as you star in Madonna:
The Unauthorized Rusical.

161
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,638
[cheering]

162
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,172
#DragRace.

163
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,241
A Rusical! It's here!

164
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,143
This is my favorite challenge.

165
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,245
I have a Rusical party
where me and my friends

166
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,114
just watch each and every
Rusical from each season.

167
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:56,683
But also I'm a singer,
I'm a dancer,

168
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,084
so to be a part of it

169
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,621
and to think that I could
possibly win it is astounding.

170
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,624
Now, each of you
will portray Madonna

171
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:09,195
from a different iconic moment
in her epic career.

172
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,598
First, you'll be
recording vocals

173
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,335
with the world's foremost
Madonna expert...

174
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,569
Michelle Visage.

175
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,705
[cheers and laughter]

176
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,407
And then you'll strike a pose

177
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:24,744
with a man who has choreographed
Madonna herself...

178
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,246
Jamal Sims.

179
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:29,082
-Oh.
-Oh.

180
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,786
Uh-oh.

181
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,655
I'm nervous this is gonna be
some intricate dancing.

182
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,658
Jackie, karma's a bitch,
ain't it?

183
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,261
[laughs]

184
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,029
To help dress you up,

185
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,066
we've got hair
provided by Wigs and Grace

186
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:49,536
and heels provided by
Fierce Queen.

187
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,970
Yes!

188
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,240
There are several many
different Madonna parts,

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,910
and you get to assign the roles.

190
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,314
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

191
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,851
Come on, ladies,
pass out those lyrics, girls.

192
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,721
Now is the time for us
to pick out our roles.

193
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,623
The catch is is that nobody's
in charge of assigning,

194
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,159
so we all kind of
have to listen to the song

195
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,961
and duke it out
and see who's gonna get what.

196
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,162
Let's go through the list,
right?

197
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,897
Boy Toy Madonna?

198
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,432
I want Boy Toy Madonna.

199
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,968
-Sexy Madonna?
-I really wanna do that one.

200
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,269
-That'd be cute.
-So Jaida, then sure.

201
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,804
What about Fempire?

202
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,807
I want Fempire number one,
all day, nothing else.

203
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,275
-That's the one I want.
-Okay.

204
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,377
Early Madonna?

205
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,978
Does anybody
really want Early Madonna?

206
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,381
[chuckles]

207
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,649
I feel like Early Madonna, Jan,

208
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,718
is, like, you're
the only one I think of us

209
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,320
could make that
actually sound good.

210
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,422
Thank you, no.

211
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:46,393
I just don't wanna go first.

212
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,762
You get to open up the show,
girl.

213
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,930
You've been saying
you wanna show us all up.

214
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,199
Yeah, I'll sing my tits off.

215
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,534
All right,
I'll do Early Madonna.

216
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,336
So let's keep going.
Does anyone want, like,

217
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:59,072
the most current Madonna,
the Spoken Rap Madonna?

218
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,306
That's my number one choice.

219
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,708
Okay, Madonna Forever is Heidi.

220
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,443
Crystal seems like
Enlightened Madonna,

221
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:05,879
like, in her light to me.

222
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,846
Like, you are
the most hippy-dippy

223
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:07,881
out of the rest of us.

224
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,282
I mean that
with the all the love.

225
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,351
-I'll take it.
-And I'll do Movie Star.

226
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,686
-Cone Bra Madonna?
-I want that so bad.

227
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,256
-I want it, too.
-Okay, so Brita and Gigi.

228
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,125
That's my number one.

229
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,027
Gigi really wants Cone Bra.

230
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,595
[whining] I really want
Cone Bra Madonna.

231
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,697
I mean, we may have to rock,
paper, scissors that.

232
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,435
Yeah, I can't--
I'm not doing Unapologetic.

233
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,203
I can't.
It's too high for me.

234
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,639
Ugh.

235
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,007
My question to you is

236
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:37,977
would you be willing
to do Unapologetic Madonna?

237
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:41,915
I know that the choreography for
this video is incredibly iconic.

238
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,017
[sighs] Okay. Yeah,
I'll do Unapologetic.

239
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,186
Okay, great, I'll do Cone Bra.

240
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,720
Final choices
locked and loaded, ladies?

241
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,656
-Yes.
-Locked and loaded.

242
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:50,757
Bitch, we're Madonna.

243
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:55,428
Some of you hos are in trouble.
[laughs]

244
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,997
I got my first choice.end of act

245
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,936
-Hi!
-Hi!

246
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,639
It's time to record
the Madonna-inspired tracks

247
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,174
in front of Michelle Visage.

248
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,342
And I know Michelle

249
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,378
is the biggest Madonna fan
in the world,

250
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,114
so I really gotta put
my Madonna spin on it.

251
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,118
Say hello to our composer
and producers,

252
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,321
David Steinberg
and Erik Paparozzi.

253
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,456
-Hi.
-So I hope you're ready.

254
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,859
Jan, let's start with you.

255
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:29,062
The rest of you take a seat.
You're doing Early Madonna.

256
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,363
Yes. I think the lyrics

257
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,099
speak to what I wanna do
in this competition.

258
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,100
I wanna win this challenge.

259
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,402
-Wow, she's hungry.
-Famished.

260
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,137

You sound fantastic.

267
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,791
Your high register
is killing it.

268
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,760
Thank you.

269
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:06,499
Let's give the fucking singer
the lead role at the beginning,

270
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,702
which means the rest of us
non-singing bitches

271
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,505
gotta follow that shit.

272
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,673
You kicked it off right.

273
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,343
You all have
big Madonna shoes to fill.

274
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,146
Whose fucking idea was that?

275
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,750
Now, Jaida,
you're doing Sex Madonna.

276
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,851
Yes, of course.

277
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,486
Okay, here we go. Hit it!

278
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:29,656
I made a video in Paris.

279
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,759
It was too hot for MTV.

280
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,394
Okay.

281
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,329
Okay, stop, stop.

Okay. [laughs]

Girl.

286
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:48,341
It's ironic that Jaida
is the trade of the season

287
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,243
and finds it hard to be sexy.

288
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,979
Maybe she's not
the trade of the season.

289
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,348
What if I'm the trade
of the season?

290
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,183
[gasps]

291
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,585
Oh, girl, we gotta talk.

292
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,220
Jaida, listen,
it's wanting...

-Whoo!
-Okay, here we go.

297
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,667
I made a video in Paris.

298
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,736

00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,223
I went to school
for musical theater.

a vocal scholarship.

334
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,063
And she became a drag queen,
she stopped singing...

335

of all time,

could sing the deep part, too.

One thing I know
about working with Madonna

395
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,941
is that she don't play.

396
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,976

all right?

and we'll start from the top.

400
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,784
So we're gonna start here.

401
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:27,687
One, two, three, four.

402
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,157
I'm gonna turn,
five, six, seven, eight.

403
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:35,328
Snap that Daftboy fan,
all right?

404
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,930
And make sure that this line
is a line, right?

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,365
It should be here.subtitle

406
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,201
Let's try this.

407
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,103
Let's see it, let's see it.
Here we go.

408
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,438
Are you okay?

409
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,139
Yeah, I just hurt my knee
the first challenge, so--

410
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,308
You did, really?

411
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,743
In the first challenge,

412
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,712
when I did my slide split
across the stage,

413
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,981
I busted my knee open.

414
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:58,985
So the fan choreography on the
ground going down to one knee

415
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:01,721
is painful
than a motherfucker.

416
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:02,989
I mean, I can do it.

417
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,790
I just need to switch knees
or I need a kneepad

418
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,992
or I'm gonna just bleed
all over the place

419
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,294
and we can just make it do
what it does.

420
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,832
Let's do a different version
for you, all right?

421
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,200
So instead of the knee,
we're gonna do a sit.

422
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,303
Turn five, six, seven, sit.

423
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,339
Great. So we'll be
watching for the knee

424
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,774
through this whole performance.

425
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,543
If there's anything that feels
uncomfortable, let me know.

426
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,279
But the show must go on, right?

427
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,614
[exhales]

428
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,349
It seems to me

429
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,251
that Widow has trouble
rolling with the punches.

430
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,387
I mean, I understand
your whole leg is cut up,

431
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,555
but also that was challenge one,

432
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,556
and that shit
should be healed by now, sis.

433
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,990
Like, why are you complaining?

434
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:43,229
All right, so who's ready to get
their individual choreography?

435
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:46,632
Yeah? All right, Jan,
Early Madonna...

436
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,401
-Yep.
-...is very jazzy, right?

437
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,102
So we're gonna get
these hips swiveling.

438
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,072
I want one, two,
hips, hip.

439
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,841
Wow. Now grapevine.

440
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,511

and wow, wow, hmm, pop.

00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,680
-And snap that at the end, okay?
-Cool.

442
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,548
Jan is killing it.

443
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,649
This is what Jan does.

444
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,917
Try it one more time.

445
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,553
She went to a very expensive
musical theater school,

446
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,956
and, like, this is really
a time for her to shine.

447
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:14,126
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

448
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,630
Jan also sometimes thinks that
she's better than other people,

449
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,432
and sometimes
you gotta check that bitch.

450
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,467
Five, six, seven, eight.

451
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,269
-Great.
-Yeah.

452
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,804

00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,905

it feels like that, right?

498
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,693
Okay.

Let me have it.

00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,641
Class is in session.
All right.

00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,643

00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,373
and you were in
the bottom two last week.

522
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,376
So you've really got to step
your Madonna pussy up now, girl.

523
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:49,849
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

524
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,383
One, two, three, four,

525
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,384
Girl, shit.

526
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,987
I'm pumping and humping,

527
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,889
and I'm doing something
to the air.

528
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,758
I don't know
if it's a Roger Rabbit.

529
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:03,362
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

Yes, Brita!

531
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,298
Brita is over here

532
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,268
Roger Rabbiting
all the way wrong.

533
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,370
Ooh, ooh, nah, bah, bah.

534
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,073
-Mama, no.
-One, two, good, three, four,

535
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,642
cross, five, six,
seven, eight.

536
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,844
[all laugh]

537
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:21,714
Don't defeat yourself
before you've done this.

538
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,349
Okay.

539
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,717
Don't think
that you can't do it.

540
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,318
You're still in the game.

541
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,753
I'm praying to Madonna
right now,

542
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,290
just asking for help
with these moves.

543
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,826
Because I am not going anywhere.

544
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,896

Bitch, we're Madonna!

547
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,271
Today is the day

548
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,740
that we're going to be doing
our lip sync performance

549
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,809
of Madonna:
The Unauthorized Rusical.

550
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,711
I think your vocal
sounds so good.

551
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:56,081
Thanks! I was feeling
really good in rehearsal.

552
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,052
I got to sing,
I'm opening the musical.

553
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,321
I finally feel like
this is the one.

554
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,924
This is the challenge
that I'm going to win.

555
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,992
Is anybody nervous?

556
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,929
I'm nervous because I've been
in the bottom three times.

557
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,898
I hope
that I'm at least safe.

558
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,600
I have to represent
for New York City,

559
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,969
so I need to show them the Brita

560
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,371
that everyone in New York City
knows and loves,

561
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,408
and I'm glad I have
another chance to do
that.subtitle

562
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,349
I think there was a phase in her
career that she had a beard.

563
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,985
Thinking about Truth or Dare,

564
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:35,921
which featured
all of her queer dancers,

565
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,456
and that
there weren't other artists

566
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,658
really highlighting
the LGBT community.

567
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,094
The reason why
I really appreciate Madonna

568
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:46,098
is all the work she's done
for HIV and AIDS and all that.

569
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,099
Oh, yeah.

570
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,867
I actually had an uncle,

571
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,037
he passed when I was young
from HIV.

572
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,006
It was hard, because he was--

573
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,242
he really made me feel
like I belonged,

574
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,943
and made me feel like--

575
00:22:57,943 --> 00:22:59,612
Was he a guncle?

576
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,781
He was a guncle, yes,
he was a fabulous guncle,

577
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,984
and I miss him so very much.

578
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,686
My uncle
was the very first person

579
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,089
I felt a really good
connection with.

580
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,725
He wasn't well
for a long period of time.

581
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,727
I would be the one to run
and get his medicine

582
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,895
and bring it to him
so he'd be okay,

583
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:22,901
and then just one day
it was over, and just...

584
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,870
It was hard losing him, because
it was right around the time

585
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,039
I started getting bullied
at school.

586
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,508
-So it was just--
-So you didn't have--

587
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:33,545
I no longer had that blanket
of security that he gave me.

588
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,481
I don't have
the best relationship

589
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,517
with my father at all.

590
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,119
Crystal, you have
a good relationship

591
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,687
with your father, right?

592
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,889
Yeah, I'm really close
with my family.

593
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:44,990
That's part of the reason

594
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,759
why I haven't moved out
of my small town.

595
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,093
That's so amazing.

596
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,595
In doing drag, him and my mom

597
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,964
love to go garage sale-ing
and find me props.

598
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,465
-Aw!
-Oh!

599
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,337
And a few years ago, my father
was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

600
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,505
-Yeah.
-Oh!

601
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,573
So it's been affecting...

602
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,077
it, like, all has been
happening really fast.

603
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:09,248
So just watching him,
like, lose mobility

604
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:11,750
and, like, not be able to,
like, sit up and stuff

605
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,986
for long periods of time
has been really hard.

606
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:18,090
Every time I leave the house,
I usually drive away crying.

607
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,560
Um...

608
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,864
I don't know how to support him.

609
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,966
He's, like, literally
been my superhero

610
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,802
and taught me
how to do everything.

611
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,971
And that's why I'm so crafty.

612
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,472
He was, like,
a construction worker,

613
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,507
so, like, him not even
being able to, like,

614
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,076
do things with his hands
anymore--

615
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,711
Like, my mom doesn't cook.

616
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,212
He cooked every meal.

617
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:43,582
And, like, he can't even,
like, you know, use a knife.

618
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:47,019
So, you know, that's a bummer.

619
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,988
I just worry about him
and think about him,

620
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,293
and, you know,
I just wanna make him proud.

621
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,295
Let's rally around our sister.

622
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,663
Thanks, babe.

623
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:59,465
Don't cry too much, bitch.
You can't mess up your face.

624
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,899
Don't cry too much.

625
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,769
Crystal is somebody
that just reminds me so much

626
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,872
of some of my really close
friends back home.

627
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,842
And I think it's been
such a short amount of time

628
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,045
since we've all been together,
but we've built a family.

629
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:16,648
And families fight,
and families get over it.

630
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,251
I hope that people
can forgive and forget,

631
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,121
because for as long
as we do have each other,

632
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,289
we are all that we have.

take one thing off.

997
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,654

and a red pleather onesie.

1045
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,354
I just like it
'cause also my titties

1046
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,922
are smushed in it
like a can of biscuits,

1047
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,357
so I'm definitely giving you

1048
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,526
that Michelle vibe
with the titties.

1049
00:43:48,526 --> 00:43:49,961
RuPaul: That's when Michelle

1050
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,129
was trying
to join the Spice Girls

1051
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,332
as Old Spice.

1052
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:55,800
[all laugh]

1053
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,903
RuPaul: Heidi on the set
of Towie Michelle.

1054
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,037
Michelle: Oh, my God.

1055
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,439
-Dug deep for this one.
-Yes!

1056
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,007
Michelle: Y'all right, babes?

1057
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,509
Y'all right?
Y'all right, babes?

1058
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:07,745
Heidi: I chose this look
because it's a little elegant,

1059
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:11,315
and I like to think of myself
as, you know, she's a lady.

1060
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,017
RuPaul:
Michelle's huge in the UK.

1061
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:14,051
Carson: Or at least her bun is.

1062
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,320
Michelle: Yeah.
My bun's always huge.

1063
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,223
[all laugh]end of act

1064
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,860
Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

1065
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:27,165
Now, when I call your name,
please step forward.

1066
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,169
Jan.

1067
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,538
Gigi Goode.

1068
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:34,805
Crystal Methyd.

1069
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,608
Jackie Cox.

1070
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:40,111
Heidi.

1071
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,113
Brita.

1072
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:47,251
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1073
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,823
Sherry Pie,
Jaida Essence Hall,

1074
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,091
the Widow Von'Du.

1075
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,094
You're safe.
You may leave the stage.

1076
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:05,203
Ladies, now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1077
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,205
starting with Simply Jan.

1078
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,107
You were Early Madonna.

1079
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:12,577
-Yes.
-Your voice was amazing.

1080
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:13,945
You sounded like a pop star.

1081
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,313
And I think
all of the choreography

1082
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,747
was borderline perfect.

1083
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:18,216
-Yes!
-Oh, Borderline.

1084
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,084
That was a Borderline joke,
everybody!

1085
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,920
And tonight on the runway,
this is fantastic.

1086
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,021
It was already drag.

1087
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,591
-Yeah, girl.
-And you made it draggier.

1088
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:28,960
You bring this polish
to your look

1089
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,462
that I think
really should be something

1090
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,530
to be proud of tonight.

1091
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:33,798
Thank you so much.

1092
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:35,600
Just being able
to do what I love

1093
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,734
for all of you is amazing.

1094
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,069
Oh, one last question.

1095
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,137
Can your breasts be used
as a flotation device?

1096
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,073
Absolutely,
if you pull hard enough.

1097
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,342
[all laugh]

1098
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:46,911
Up next, Jackie Cox.

1099
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:50,114
You came straight
out of the Tristate area

1100
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,749
with this runway look.

1101
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,184
I love it.

1102
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:56,087
It's bold,
maybe borderline, um--

1103
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,655
-Tacky?
-Tacky, yes.

1104
00:45:57,655 --> 00:45:59,490
Trashy? Whoreish?

1105
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,992
You nailed it!

1106
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:04,695
Out of everybody, you have
every single detail nailed,

1107
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,664
down to the nails.

1108
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,766
You had the corset nailed
that I had painted,

1109
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,067
the lightning bolt,

1110
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,303
and you're the only one
who has the mole.

1111
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,238
Gigi has a mole.

1112
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,239
Put your glasses on, Michelle!

1113
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,841
I did!

1114
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:19,110
Let's see. Moles up,
everybody, moles up.

1115
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,811
Now everyone has the mole.

1116
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,246
[all laugh]

1117
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,515
When you came out
in the wedding dress,

1118
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:27,118
I just felt it was
a little bit more restrained.

1119
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,854
There was an extra oomph
that was just missing.

1120
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:30,988
We wanted more.

1121
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,991
It seems as though
there's an uncertainty,

1122
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,861
and there's no reason
for you to be uncertain.

1123
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,096
You are right
exactly as you are.

1124
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:41,399
Just share you with us.

1125
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,767
Thank you.

1126
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:47,271
I do have to say
it is--aah!

1127
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,506
Crazy to meet you.

1128
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,174
[laughs]

1129
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:53,377
Seeing you working in Congress

1130
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:57,248
and in solidarity
with Congresswoman Tlaib

1131
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:00,551
and Congresswoman Omar

1132
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,155
gives me so much hope
for our country.

1133
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:07,625
My mom emigrated here from Iran,

1134
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,160
and people would tell her
to go home

1135
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,795
and go back where she came from.

1136
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:18,669
And when I was young, I hid this
part of my heritage for so long.

1137
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,671
She's an American citizen now,

1138
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,842
and seeing you standing up
for people like my mom

1139
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,777
gives me so much hope.

1140
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,414
I'm so thankful
that your mother is here

1141
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,616
and part of our country.

1142
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:33,884
Thank you.

1143
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,953
Thank you.

1144
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,322
Up next, Gigi Goode.

1145
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:40,891
You sold every moment
of your performance,

1146
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,327
because you were just actually
living what you were singing

1147
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,528
and connecting with the judges.

1148
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,765
I really feel as though
you embodied Madonna,

1149
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,433
that energy, the most.

1150
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,302
You look amazing.

1151
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:53,604
I didn't think it could get
any more supermodel

1152
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,073
until you walked out here
in a freaking bikini.

1153
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,908
I thought,
is that my new competition

1154
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,076
in the modeling world?

1155
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,045
Oh, my God!

1156
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,180
This was really fun to see,
down to the nails.

1157
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,049
And now that you have
the fake ones on,

1158
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,450
imagine doing anything
with them.

1159
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:07,785
How did you wipe?

1160
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,487
[all laugh]

1161
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,388
Just to inform everybody,
you don't wipe with your nails,

1162
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,257
you wipe with your fingertips.

1163
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:14,425
What? Really?

1164
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,227
So the toilet paper goes around,
and you scoop.

1165
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,162
The more you know.

1166
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:20,698
[all laugh]

1167
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:22,433
-Up next, Brita.
-Hi.

1168
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,468
I think what happened
with you, Brita,

1169
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,237
is when you did mess up
here and there,

1170
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,671
it kind of threw you off.

1171
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,440
On the runway, however,
this happens to be

1172
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,375
one of my favorite gowns
I've ever worn.

1173
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:32,810
I love how it fits you.

1174
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:34,612
It fits you
just like it fit Michelle.

1175
00:48:34,612 --> 00:48:36,847
The structure, the glasses.

1176
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,382
But I did wear
a drop earring.

1177
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:39,583
I'd never wear a button.

1178
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,585
Yeah, I know you did,
and it was beautiful.

1179
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,720
It's a pretty simple look.

1180
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,855
It's glasses, earrings,
and the dress,

1181
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,957
and now the earrings
are kind of taking us away

1182
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:51,896
from how great
all the rest of it is.

1183
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:54,331
Up next, Crystal Methyd DeBarge.

1184
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,666
♪ To the beat
of the rhythm of the night ♪

1185
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:56,867
Hi.

1186
00:48:56,867 --> 00:48:59,670
I thought your
Madonna Rusical number

1187
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,105
was funny and quirky.

1188
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:04,175
You kind of sang the reverb
on all of those chorus moments.

1189
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:05,976
Was that something
that you came up with?

1190
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:06,977
I thought it would be fun.

1191
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,813
I know that
I'm not, like, a singer,

1192
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:12,183
so I wanted to try and play up
the funny as much as I could.

1193
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:15,786
As someone who cannot sing
herself, I totally get it.

1194
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,256
And I love the hair-ography,
so great job.

1195
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,257
Thank you.

1196
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:21,659
I absolutely love this look.

1197
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,195
I love the hair.
It's giving me life.

1198
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:26,163
You did a great job tonight.

1199
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,331
-Thank you.
-I'm really proud of you

1200
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,133
and your uptick that you're on.

1201
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,134
Thank you.

1202
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,468
Don't fall back.

1203
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,304
I won't.

1204
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:34,638
Up next, Heidi Ciccone.

1205
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,273
[all laugh]

1206
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,575
Hi.

1207
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,077
Your performance was amazing.

1208
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,914
You gave us the chaturangas,
the vinyasas, the B-girls.

1209
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,916
You really rose to the occasion.

1210
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,886
But what was kind of missing
was Madonna.

1211
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:51,555
She would poke through,
and then go away.

1212
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:54,959
Tonight on the runway,
I'm glad you did a recent one.

1213
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,294
I don't know how
you ended up choosing this one.

1214
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,563
You know, I was just scrolling
on the social medias

1215
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:00,598
and whatnot.

1216
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:02,399
-[laughs]
-The medias.

1217
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,735
I think the only issue for me
would be the hair.

1218
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,070
It was more textured,

1219
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,305
because I don't want it to look
like a globe on my head.

1220
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,908
She has
a little buoyancy to her.

1221
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:12,877
What's in the middle?

1222
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:14,411
Hairspray and desperation.

1223
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,646
I've been there.

1224
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,350
Well, thank you, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

1225
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,618
You may leave the stage.

1226
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,556
All right, now,
just between us Madonna-bes,

1227
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,658
what do you think? Jan.

1228
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:30,628
Jan has a beautiful voice
and she knows how to use it,

1229
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:33,030
but more importantly,
she embodied Madonna.

1230
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,833
Her runway look,
the makeup was perfect,

1231
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,067
the clothes were perfect.

1232
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,437
The details really brought
both characters to life,

1233
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:42,373
and I think
she did a fabulous job.

1234
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,674
Jackie Cox.

1235
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:45,976
Jackie Cox
had a very polarizing night.

1236
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:47,311
The Rusical performance,

1237
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,513
I say to myself all the time,
I wish it was bigger.

1238
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,015
[laughs]

1239
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:54,485
How she was playing it
was more innocent and coy,

1240
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:55,719
and that wasn't this Madonna.

1241
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,554
The runway, though,
was the flipside of that.

1242
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,823
It was really impressive.

1243
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:00,925
Gigi Goode.

1244
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:03,327
She is such a superstar.

1245
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:05,496
She did a back handspring
in heels.

1246
00:51:05,496 --> 00:51:06,630
Then she did lifts.

1247
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,865
Then when she was in the air,

1248
00:51:07,865 --> 00:51:09,667
she did, like, a round-off.

1249
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:13,003
She was that badass Madonna

1250
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,439
that girls look at and say,

1251
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,441
"I wanna be that
when I walk down the street."

1252
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,877
I am obsessed with Gigi.

1253
00:51:19,877 --> 00:51:22,046
She gives me supermodel vibes.

1254
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,414
I love
that Michelle Visage look.

1255
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,718
It was a simple look,
but my God, she pulled it off.

1256
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,887
Let's move on down to Brita.

1257
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:31,188
In her Madonna moment,

1258
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:34,224
she was representing
that Gaultier-era cone bra.

1259
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,260
That's all about,
like, domination

1260
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,195
and it just didn't have
that feeling for me.

1261
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:40,030
She did get in her head,

1262
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:46,136
but I just really love
the joy that Brita brings.

1263
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,973
Tonight on the runway, the gown
was wonderful and smooth,

1264
00:51:48,973 --> 00:51:51,041
but the earrings
were completely off

1265
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,676
and it changed the look
a little bit.

1266
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,078
You're absolutely right,
you know.

1267
00:51:54,078 --> 00:51:57,448
The devil is in the details,
and those things do matter.

1268
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,316
Crystal Methyd.

1269
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:02,319
As Enlightened Madonna,
she was really silly.

1270
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,488
Like, her head popped up,
and it was just kind of funny.

1271
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,656
We're really getting to know her

1272
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:07,091
at this point
in the competition.

1273
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:10,494
The more she reveals of herself,
the more we're charmed by her.

1274
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:14,331
She was kind of giving me
Madonna as Bianca Del Rio

1275
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:18,168
or Bianca Del Rio as Madonna.

1276
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,470
Heidi.

1277
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,506
She has oodles and oodles
of charisma.

1278
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,341
-Mm-hmm.
-Great dancer.

1279
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,277
But I didn't get
any Madonna-isms at all.

1280
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,879
And especially with
some of the gags that she had,

1281
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,881
you know, the underwear
peek-a-boo moment

1282
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,683
she could have really hammed up.

1283
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,118
And then tonight on the runway,

1284
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:36,253
I love that she chose
the Towie look,

1285
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,289
but it just got a little skewed.

1286
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,291
Her performance, her charisma,
it was all there.

1287
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:46,163
It just had no relationship
to Madonna or Michelle Visage.

1288
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,198
Because if you squint,

1289
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,267
they're pretty much the same.

1290
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:52,169
[all laugh]
They are.

1291
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,973
Silence.
I've made my decision.

1292
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:57,808
Bring back my material girls.end
of act

1293
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,110
Welcome back, ladies.

1294
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,613
I've made some decisions.

1295
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,153
Jan, tonight
you ruled the world.

1296
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,022
You are safe.

1297
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,692
You may join the other girls.

1298
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:21,832
I know Jan wanted to win this.

1299
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,934
Like, y'all didn't see her face
when she turned around,

1300
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:24,935
but I saw that.

1301
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,170
You know like the scary movies

1302
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,705
where the serial killer
finally just, like, snaps

1303
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:30,307
and just starts
tearing faces off?

1304
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:34,311
Hon-ey, she is upset.

1305
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,446
[laughs]

1306
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,850
Crystal Methyd.

1307
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,587
I feel like
you just got home-home-home.

1308
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,722
[all laugh]

1309
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
You're safe.

1310
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:52,262
Gigi Goode.

1311
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:53,497
I've made up my mind.

1312
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,165

1316
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:02,840
Thank you.

1317
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,211
You've won a cash tip
of $5.000.

1318
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:11,648
Oh, my God, I just won
my third challenge.

1319
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:13,283
That's nuts to me.

1320

You may join the other girls.

1321
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,695
Jackie Cox,
you nailed your Michelle,

1322
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:28,298
but your virgin
wasn't shiny and new.

1323
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,969
Brita, you are a joy,

1324
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:36,707
but tonight you didn't fully
express yourself.

1325
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:40,978
Heidi, tonight in the Rusical

1326
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:43,514
you got the moves
and the motion,

1327
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:47,718
but your Madonna
didn't cause a commotion.

1328
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,322
Jackie Cox.

1329
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,260

Brita and Heidi.

1334
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:13,977
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

1335
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,215
Two queens stand before me.

1336
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:23,787
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1337
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:26,757
and save yourself...

This is my third time
lip-syncing.

What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
leave it all on the stage.

I'm here to fight.
I'm a fighter.
