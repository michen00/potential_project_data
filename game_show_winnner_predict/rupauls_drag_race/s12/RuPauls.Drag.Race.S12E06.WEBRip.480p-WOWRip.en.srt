00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:25,859
You need to overact
in Gay's Anatomy.

3
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,828
-Aah!
-[laughs]

4
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:29,663
[deep voice]
Get this baby outta me!

5
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm about to shove my baby egg
in your--sorry.

6
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:37,704
Heidi N Closet.

7
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,373
I almost feel like I'm looking
at two different outfits.

8
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,774
Nicky Doll.

9
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,977
I just wanted you to do more
with this super funny drag baby.

10
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,514
Heidi, shantay you stay.

11
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,285
Nicky Doll, sashay away.mirror?

12
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:04,531
Oh, my God, girl.

13
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,100
Jeez Louise.

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,303
Oh, Nicky.

15
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,438
Watch out, because I don't plan
on lip syncing no more.

16
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,106
[all laugh]

17
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,175
Don't put me in the bottom
no more!

18
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:18,679
I had been doing so well
up until this point,

19
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,781
and then bang, oh!

20
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,584
It was like taking me
from 100 to a 10 real fast.

21
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,753
But I think I showed everyone
just what I'm made of,

22
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,956
and I'm ready to send
all them home if I need to.

23
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:33,093
Brita, how did you feel
about being towards the bottom?

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,728
I was shook, honestly.

25
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,763
I don't know why
I was in the bottom.

26
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,432
And I don't know why,
honestly,

27
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:43,870
why my scene partner
wasn't in the bottom with me.

28
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,472
Again?

29
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,907
We're doing this again?

30
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,508
Why does she get a free escape

31
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,410
when all of our stuff
was together?

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,812
All we can do

33
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:55,015
is try to bring what the judges
are asking from us specifically.

34
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:59,419
Just because Brita views herself
as a strong competitor

35
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:02,456
and is upset that
she is in the bottom this week,

36
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,726
she feels like somehow
that's my fault.

37
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,895
Look, we all were great
in this challenge.

38
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,897
There is no mother-freaking
excuses anymore.

39
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,201
So you better
be on your Ps and Qs, bitch.

40
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,004
This is not
RuPaul's Excuse Race, bitch.

41
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,538
Let's go.
Let's get out of drag.

42
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,309
How you feeling, boo-boo?

43
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,711
It's just been a buildup
from the moment we got here.

44
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,179
Oh, I understand.
Yeah, I understand.

45
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,648
I don't wanna have to continue
going through this competition

46
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,484
in those moments feeling good
about myself,

47
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,853
just to have other people,
like, tearing me down.

48
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,955
These bitches have been
coming for me from day one.

49
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,657
Honestly, I'm not here for it,

50
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:41,995
so quiet Aiden isn't gonna
be quiet for much longer.

51
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,197
At the end of the day,
it is what it is.

52
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,099
All we can do is fucking slay.

53
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,768
There's 10 girls left
in this competition.

54
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,370
It's time to step up my game,

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,706
because I am not satisfied
with just being safe now.

56
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,674
If you're accepting
any less than the top,

57
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,309
then you might as well
get packing.

58
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,015
Whoo!

59
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,286

We're on Drag Race!
How fun!

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,949
It's a new day in the werkroom.

72
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,717
I haven't won a challenge yet.

73
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,820
Just Jan has been just safe.

74
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,856
So I'm ready to slay
whatever's coming my way.

75

Hello, hello, hello!

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,628
All right, suit.

78
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,863
Yeah, the Emerald City
has arrived.

79
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,433
Now, ladies, for this week's
maxi-challenge...

80
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,036
We're playing the Snatch Game.

81
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,939
[cheering]

82
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,708
Pick a celebrity
that you can impersonate,

83
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,144
then make me
and the world laugh.

84
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:08,281
RuPaul Charles
done shuck up the building.

85
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,051
It's the motherfucking
Snatch Game.

86
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,554
I'm excited!

87
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:19,793
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win!

88
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,796
[applause]
Yes!

89
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,264
Let's get snatched.

90
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,199
I wanna know
who everyone's doing.

91
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,069
The Snatch Game
shows the drag queens

92
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,705
at their celeb
impersonation best...

93
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,174
or not so best.

94
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,543
Brita, what are you
thinking of doing?

95
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,811
Jennifer Holliday.

96
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,146
Jaida, what about you?

97
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,647
I'm doing Cardi B.

98
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,349
-Aow!
-Oh, shut up.

99
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,584
Yes, so, okurr?

100
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,386
I'm doing...

101
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,954
Widow, who are you doing?

102
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,590
You can't tell by the hair?

103
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,361
-It looks like Tinta Turntur.
-Thank you.

104
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,130
Someone's cultured
in this bitch.

105
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,934
I'm thinking of doing
Ike and Tina.

106
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,237
Widow's doing Tina Turner,

107
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,039
but then halfway through
she wants to do Ike Turner.

108
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,108
But I don't know
if that's a good idea.

109
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,910
Like, eww.

110
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,479
It seems like
a very sticky situation.

111
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,481
Luckily, I did good
in the last improv,

112
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,918
so hopefully I can continue
my improv career.

113
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,388
Yeah, I was in the top group
that week,

114
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,090
but as my sisters in that group
liked to say,

115
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,792
they "carried me through," so...

116
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,327
Yeah, they did say that,
didn't they?

117
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,062
Aiden?

118
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,632
I am doing Patricia Quinn.

119
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:33,967
Who's that?

120
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,503
She played Magenta in
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

121
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,637
Oh.

122
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,974
She's like an old,
kooky woman now, so--

123
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:44,044
Are you playing the old her
or the new her?

124
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,279
The more current old her, yeah.

125
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,714
She's somebody
that I've met personally

126
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,815
and I've had lunch with.

127
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,518
Oh, okay, cute.

128
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,819
I hang out with my mom.

129
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,487
It doesn't mean she's funny.

130
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,289
Good luck, bitch,

131
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,391
because she doesn't have
any scene partners in this one.

132
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,998
Our maxi-challenge today
is the Snatch Game.

133
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,935
I'm super excited
and a little terrified.

134
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,471
America is judging you
during Snatch Game.

135
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,474
Hey, stars!

136
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:15,942
-Hey!
-Hey!

137
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:17,277
We've got company.

138
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,812
-Ooh!
-Uh-oh!

139
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:21,581
Bam, bitch! Yeah!

140
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,483
[cheers and applause]

141
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,119
Aah! Vanjie is here!

142
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,520
I am so excited to see her.

143
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,521
Vanjie!

144
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,623
-Vanjie!
-Vanjie!

145
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,993
She has the iconic Miss Vanjie.

146
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,928
-Miss Vanjie.
-Vanjie.

147
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:37,564
I'm not a regular there.
I'm cool.

148
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,999
Thank you, Miss Vanjie.

149
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,834
I thanked myself.

150
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,371
She's one of the most popular
people from this competition.

151
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,473
Vanjie and I are here
to school you

152
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:50,810
on the dos and don'ts
of winning Snatch Game.

153
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,579
Y'all know I'm here
for the don'ts.

154
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,414
[all laugh]

155
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,549
My Snatch Game was...

156
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,353
[whistles, laughs]

157
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,354
What's up, Dr. Phil?

158
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,456
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
I mean, Ru.

159
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:06,559
So I'm here to let
the chickenheads know

160
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,827
what not to do for Snatch Game.

161
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,862
That's what we're doing today.

162
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,597
Come on, Vanjie.

163
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,832
I want you to meet Heidi.

164
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,668
-Hi!
-Hi, Heidi.

165
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,770
-How are you doing?
-Good, and you?

166
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,371
I'm doing blessed
and highly favored.

167
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,106
That's right, mm.

168
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,375
[laughs]
See, now, that's funny.

169
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,444
Are you in character right now?

170
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,846
That was Heidi, but, no,
I got Leslie Jones on the back,

171
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,448
and she's about
to come out here, so, yeah.

172
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,252
Oh! Now, Heidi,
you're very charismatic.

173
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,288
How are you gonna infuse that
into Leslie Jones?

174
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,559
Leslie Jones, her comedy
is very loud, in your face,

175
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,162
and very thirsty with her skits.

176
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,097
So I can really
tap into that real well,

177
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,465
so I'm going there.

178
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,567
Why did you choose someone
who's got a Southern accent

179
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,569
who's very close
to your personality?

180
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,171
You know, all you bitches
come in here,

181
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,372
and you think
you're Meryl Streep.

182
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,040
[laughs]

183
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,709
Why not stay
a little bit close to home?

184
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,477
That way, you don't
have to work so hard.

185
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,879
I feel like you could
definitely give me

186
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,148
one of the Housewives
of Atlanta.

187
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,150
-Phaedra.
-Oh, Phaedra.

188
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,719
She sounds like her,
doesn't she?

189
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,220
Yes, you give me
a lot of Phaedra.

190
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,089
You know, that's what
I'm getting, the vibe.

191
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,091
Atlanta Housewives, Phaedra.

192
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,661
That's somebody who I feel that
she could execute naturally.

193
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,963
Ooh, that's big. "Execute."

194
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,498
Child, I almost choked
saying that one.

195
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,333
Just start tapping into whatever
you naturally can do,

196
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,334
you know what I'm saying?

197
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,802
Because you already
naturally funny.

198
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,504
Bitch, you got acrylics, too?

199
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,439
These are my real nails.
What are you talk--acrylics?

200
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,907
[both laugh]

201
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,743
-Aah! Let me see them.
-She needs to feel it right now.

202
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,578
Them is sophisticated.
Yeah, don't do these ones.

203
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,012
Don't talk me
into feeling things.

204
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,148
You see how
you just responded there?

205
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,283
You see that volley
that you just did?

206
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,252
That's what Snatch Game is.

207
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,720
But if you have to think
too hard

208
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,790
of did Leslie Jones do that,
that will make you stumble.

209
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,527
I don't know who Miss Phaedra
is personally, and...

210
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,664
I think I'm gonna stick
with Miss Leslie Jones.

211
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,999
That's it, all right.

212
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,502
Aah! She definitely
snatched you bald on that one.

213
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,404
All right, make me laugh.

214
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,638
-Awesome sauce.
-All right.

215
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,474
Come on, Vanjie.
[laughs]

216
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:05,578
Vanjie, I wanna introduce you
to Simply Jan.

217
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,946
I see a little Tony.

218
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,449
Yeah, she's won a Tony.
You're getting warm.

219
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,617
Lindsay Lohan.

220
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,219
Oh, I know.
Bernadette Peters.

221
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,354
[imitates Bernadette Peters]
That's correct, Ru.

222
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,622
[laughs]

223
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,757
Musical theater is something
that I grew up with,

224
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,526
so I love her.

225
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,295
I know in your audition reel
you did Kris Jenner.

226
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,830
That was my music video.

227
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,900
I did Call Me Mother
for my tape as Kris Jenner,

228
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,636
walking around
my uncle's house, doing it.

229
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:31,237
That was pretty phenomenal.

230
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,873
I actually started doing drag
as Kris Jenner.

231
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,042
I was not even going by Jan.

232
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:39,012
I was just going by my boy name
"as Kris Jenner."

233
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,380
-Really?
-Yeah.

234
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,514
So you're doing Kris Jenner
today, then.

235
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,750
-Basically the fucking story.
-No, no.

236
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,921
I feel more comfortable being
able to riff as Bernadette.

237
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,457
I know her voice is
kind of like a babydoll voice.

238
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,392
[normal] Mm-hmm.
[Bernadette] Hi, how are you?

239
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,160
Are you having a good day today?

240
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,663
I'll tell you this because
I'm gonna tell you the don'ts.

241
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,099
Don't be switching your voice
halfway through.

242
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,700
I started with a voice,
and I was like that--

243
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,701
you know,
by the second question,

244
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:02,769
I said, "That has to go."

245
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,604
So don't be switching
your voice.

246
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,706
-That would be a don't.
-Do not.

247
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:07,841
Well, we will see you out there.

248
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,309
-Yes, see you out there.
-Come on, Vanjie.

249
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,543
Do it. Go on now.

250
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,113
Vanjie, meet El DeBarge.

251
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,149
No, I mean Not El DeBarge.

252
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,784
This is Crystal Methyd.

253
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,486
-Hi, Vanjie.
-Hi.

254
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:23,323
So I see a blonde wig, I see
a pink, furry something there.

255
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:27,060
I was gonna be the pop superstar
android Poppy.

256
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,797
Who?

257
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,398
So she is a robot
or not a robot?

258
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,633
She's a real person
playing a robot.

259
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,202
She's got a robot persona.

260
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,404
Well, that sounds like
a laugh riot.

261
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:42,976
If I were you, I would do
motherfucking El DeBarge.

262
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,310
Fuck. Hello!

263
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,280
Well, I mean, you need a brick
to fall on your head?

264
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,582
Ru doesn't seem to know
who Poppy is.

265
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,918
I really just don't wanna
make a fool of myself

266
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,119
during this challenge.

267
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,522
I'm a little nervous.
I never do characters,

268
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,223
and I thought it'd be something
easy to do.

269
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,559
But I'm a little worried that
it's not gonna help me stand out

270
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,194
and really show myself.

271
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,929
Yeah. Well, whatever you do,

272
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,700
make sure you stuff your
character full of behavior.

273
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,869
And preferably something
that can volley with me.

274
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,337
You know, I throw you a ball,

275
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,739
you go, oh, yeah,
motherfucker.

276
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:13,740
And, uh, bop.

277
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,343
I just--I'm putting
all this pressure on myself

278
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,345
because I know I didn't do good
in the improv challenge,

279
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,180
and this is so similar.

280
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,284
You know, I, like...

281
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:28,388
It's, like, really,
um, frustrating

282
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,557
that I've been
in the bottom, and...

283
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:34,894
Uh. And...

284
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,030
I just really wanna bring it
this challenge.

285
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,199
Okay, but I can tell you're
very sensitive right now.

286
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,900
-Yeah.
-Do you want a hug?

287
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,602
-Yeah?
-Okay.

288
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,304
Now, don't cry on my suit, okay?

289
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,272
[all laugh]

290
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,774
I really wanna do good
in the Snatch Game.

291
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,243
I know I have what it takes,
and I know what's inside of me,

292
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,446
but I just have so much
self-doubt in me right now,

293
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,281
and I...

294
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:56,549
I don't know
how to get over it.

295
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,719
Whew.

296
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,354
What got you here
in the first place

297
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,523
is what you already have.

298
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,858
You have to remember
who the fuck you are.

299
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,794
You're freaky, you're fun.

300
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,696
You are
El motherfucking DeBarge.

301
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,297
[all laugh]

302
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,066
You just gotta pop.

303
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,501
Is there anything else
I need to tell you?

304
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,971
Um... "You're the winner
of this week's challenge."

305
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,906
[all laugh]

306
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,708
See, now, that's how you volley.

307
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,043
-Do that, okay?
-Okay.

308
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,913
Seeing Crystal, I could totally
relate to how she's feeling.

309
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,349
I just hope that
she could shake this off

310
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:30,617
and, girl, press reset.

311
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,951
We'll see you out there.

312
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,057
Jackie Cox.

313
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,092
Salaam, RuPaul.

314
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,493
You are cute!

315
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:41,928
-Oh!
-Uh-huh.

316
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,996
You know, I'm known
for going into the werkroom

317
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,263
and walking out with a piece.

318
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,332
-[laughs]
-I ain't no sugar mama,

319
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,968
but I could give you a Lunchable
or something, you know.

320
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,637
Go ahead, don't be jealous.

321
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:53,139
Don't be mad.
The peanut gallery.

322
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,075
Now what you wanted to ask me?
Yes, I'm single.

323
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,678
Well, you know,
I am a taken man back home,

324
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:02,415
but we're, you know,
always down to make friends.

325
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,651
Next! Who out there--
who's single?

326
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,986
All right,
I see a little wig here.

327
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,187
Are you doing Ruth Buzzi?

328
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,089
Well, let's take another look.

329
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,458
-She's a housewife?
-She's a housewife.

330
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,960
-Oh, Lisa Rinna.
-There she is.

331
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,995
She's always trying
to sell herself,

332
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:18,131
and if it's not her, then
it's her husband Harry Hamlin,

333
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,832
who she will name-drop
at the drop of a hat.

334
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,368
Well, I mean,
on paper it sounds great.

335
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,670
What were your other choices?

336
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,004
Dame Julie Andrews.

337
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,205
Oh, I love her!

338
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,473
-I love her, too.
-Yeah.

339
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,875
But I mean, this wig,

340
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,245
I would probably do a little bit
more of a reddish.

341
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,646
I love Julia Roberts.

342
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,215
One of my favorite movies
is Pretty Woman, so...

343
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,052
Well, darling, I cannot wait
to see your Julia Roberts.

344
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,653
[laughs]

345
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,388
Make me laugh as Julia Roberts.

346
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,323
And what about Julie Andrews?

347
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,625
Thank you. I love Julia.

348
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,626
Oh, okay, bye.

349
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,729
I don't know. Well...

350
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,664
Well, Gigi Goode.

351
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,566
Good morning, Miss Paul.

352
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,801
Do you have any guesses, Vanjie?

353
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,803
She bald-headed.

354
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,338
There is this very famous robot

355
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,708
who she's been on
a number of talk shows,

356
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:05,111
she's famous for being
the first robot U.S. citizen.

357
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,479
This is a real person?

358
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,981
-Wait. No, it's a robot.
-She's a literal robot.

359
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,085
But how do you
make a robot funny?

360
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:13,453
The references
that I'm going to make

361
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,556
are more along the lines
of mechanics and science

362
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,826
and stuff like that, which
sounds so incredibly boring.

363
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:20,927
Yeah, it does.

364
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,929
However,
I have never seen someone

365
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,898
with a drier sense of humor
than a robot.

366
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:28,968
Yeah. May not work
with Snatch Game.

367
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,271
-You understand my concern.
-Absolutely.

368
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,341
Because a robot
doesn't really volley.

369
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,976
It's a lot
of rapid-fire stuff,

370
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,079
and I'm thinking that's
gonna be very difficult.

371
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,014
I understand your concern,

372
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,683
but I do not have
the same concern.

373
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,984
Okay, all right.

374
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,619
Well, you have
a lot to think about.

375
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,620
I do.

376
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,689
But mainly, make me laugh.

377
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,057
I'm going to.

378
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,992
The biggest personality
won the Snatch Game: Silky.

379
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:54,360
She was TS Madison.

380
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,695
She was doing the most.

381
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,697
And trust me, these bitches
gonna be big and loud.

382
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,966
Yeah.

383
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,200
All right,
we will see you out there.

384
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,235
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

385
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,336
-Bye. Come on, Vanjie.
-See you later.

386
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:05,371
I feel like Gigi is taking

387
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,374
probably the biggest risk
so far in this challenge,

388
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,978
because Ru wasn't really
understanding the character.

389
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:13,913
So good luck to her.

390
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
All right, ladies, gather round.

391
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,917
Gather round, ladies.

392
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,085
So, Vanjie, do you have

393
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:23,055
any final words of encouragement
for my girls?

394
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,824
Mm-hmm,
just one simple thing.

395
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,128
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up, bitch.

396
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,097
[laughter and applause]
Turn it out, bitches.

397
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,033
If not, catch me outside,
how 'bout dat?

398
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,770
Oof, the prime example
of what not to do.

399
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,639
Bye!

400
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,779
Welcome to Snatch Game!

401
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,681
Let's meet our contestants.

402
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,484
He was Damian in Mean Girls,

403
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,618
the legendary father

404
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:57,190
of the house of Glen Coco,
Daniel Franzese.

405
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,626
It's all for you, Ru Coco.
You go, Ru Coco.

406
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:04,030
Our next guest played the role
of Aaron Samuels

407
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,832
in Mean Girls.

408
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,600
Welcome, Jonathan Bennett.

409
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,969
Jonathan,
did anyone ever tell you

410
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,271
that you look sexy
with your hair pushed back?

411
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,173
That's not the only thing
that's pushed back, Ru.

412
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,675
Ooh!
[all laugh]

413
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,244
All right, contestants,
let's meet our stars.

414
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,548
First up,
from Saturday Night Live,

415
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,318
the hilarious Leslie Jones.

416
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,887
I'm back, Ru!
I just got the girls done.

417
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,423
Blacker the berry,
sweeter the juice.

418
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,124
I thought it was
"darker the berry."

419
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,593
What berries are black?

420
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,927
Blackberries.

421
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,563
[all laugh]

422
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:41,767
From the Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills, Lisa Rinna.

423
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,604
Hello, Ru. I just flew in.

424
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:48,708
I was busy selling my new line:
adult diaper swimsuits.

425
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,743
Hello!

426
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,712
-I needed one of those!
-Oh, they are perfect.

427
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:53,946
You're on the beach,

428
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,882
and you can have a piddle
and a puddle, honey.

429
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,617
Owning it!
[all laugh]

430
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:02,388
Up next, Grammy award-winning
rapper Cardi B is here.

431
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,923
Hey, y'all. Hey.

432
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,759
Ooh, and I see you're
featuring the girls there.

433
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:07,927
Ooh, always.

434
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:10,096
Now, what was
the first purchase you made

435
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,931
when you started
making all that money?

436
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,133
I got these
motherfucking teeth fixed.

437
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,201
[all laugh]

438
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,435
Which set?

439
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,204
The bottom ones.

440
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,775
Up next, we've got
a Broadway legend.

441
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,410
Bernadette Peters is here.

442
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,580
Now, of all your roles,
which one is your favorite?

443
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,815
My favorite is the one
that I won this bad boy for:

444
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,584
Annie Get Your Gun.

445
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,252
You were fantastic in that.

446
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,553
Thank you.

447
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,355
I starred
in off-Broadway production

448
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,790
of Annie Get Your Cum.

449
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,893
There's no business
like show business,

450
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,795
so let's send in the clowns!

451
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,463
Wait. They're already here.

452
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:45,498
Yeah.
[all laugh]

453
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,301
Up next, simply the best,

454
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:51,003
Tinta Turnter is in the house.

455
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,605
-Hey, Tina.
-How you doing, Ru?

456
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,007
Oh, you look fantastic.

457
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,475
What does love
have to do with it, Tina?

458
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,844
When you find out what's love
got to do with it...

459
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,346
-Uh-huh.
-I'll let you know.

460
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,415
[laughs]
This is salty Tina.

461
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:07,019
Now let's move on down here
to Maria the robot.

462
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,220
Hi, Maria.

463
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,056
What's up, bitch?

464
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:12,124
Ooh!
[all laugh]

465
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:16,162
So Maria, getting to the studio
today, do you drive yourself?

466
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,298
I'm so sorry. I'm unable
to receive that information.

467
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,702
I wonder if you can receive
a big black cock.

468
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,237
Oh, yes. Let me tell you,

469
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,173
I've got quite
the USB port for it.

470
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,942
[all laugh]

471
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,111
Up next, she played Magenta

472
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,481
in The Rocky Horror
Picture Show.

473
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,851
Loved that movie.
Patricia Quinn is here!

474
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,687
Are you ready to do
the Time Warp again?

475
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:45,458
I have no idea what
you're talking about, Ru.

476
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,226
Really?
Whatever happened to you?

477
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,394
Did you make other films?

478
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,697
I don't remember a damn thing.

479
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,399
You don't remember anything.

480
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,234
If you had done
as many drugs as I did

481
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,036
while filming
The Rocky Horror Picture Show,

482
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,604
you wouldn't remember
shit either.

483
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,109
Sis.

484
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,844
All right, up next,

485
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:09,515
the original Effie from
Dreamgirls, Jennifer Holliday.

486
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,118
Hi, Jennifer Holliday!

487
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,755
It's a beautiful day, because
it's a Jennifer Holliday.

488
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,189
-[laughs]
-I'm curious.

489
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,959
Are you still able
to hit all those notes?

490
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:24,497
Yes, I have a very--
a signature sound.

491
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,065
Okay.

492
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,534
Up next, she's a YouTube
sensation: Poppy.

493
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,269
What's new, Poppy?

494
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,471
Oh, just working on new music.

495
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,974
I'm really into death metal
right now.

496
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,976
Hmm?

497
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,611
Were you always
into death metal?

498
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,646
No, I started with pop music,

499
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,683
but they make me listen
to death metal now.

500
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,117
Who makes you listen
to death metal?

501
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,519
They, my cult.

502
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,055
Your cult? Oh, my goodness.

503
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:50,222
Hmm?

504
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:54,693
Moving on down,
she's won four Academy Awards.

505
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,729
Katharine Hepburn is here.

506
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,831
-Now, Miss Hepburn.
-Mm, yes?

507
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,132
I've always wanted to ask you,

508
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,401
if you could be any kind
of a tree--

509
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,402
Yes?

510
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:04,603
What tree would you be?

511
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:09,041
This question has popped up
so many times.

512
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,342
[all laugh]
Yes.

513
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,778
Yes, I think I would be...

514
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,947
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-

515
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,949
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-

516
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,417
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-

517
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,119
mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm--

518
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,253
an oak.

519
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,255
[all laugh]

520
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,991
All right, who's ready
to play Snatch Game?

521
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,526
The time has come

522
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,795
for you to snatch
for your life, people.

523
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,933
Welcome back to Snatch Game.

524
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,504
Daniel and Jonathan,
here's how the game works.

525
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,674
I ask a question
and you give an answer

526
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:45,411
that you think will match
our celebrity contestants.

527
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,947
Okay, here we go.
First question is for Daniel.

528
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:52,384
Mean Girls' Regina George
is so mean,

529
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,087
when you type her name
into your phone,

530
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,790
it autocorrects to blank.

531
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,627
Ducking fitch.

532
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:02,995
Stop trying to make fitch
happen.

533
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,096
It's not gonna happen.

534
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,231
[all laugh]

535
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,032
All right, let's go
to our celebrities.

536
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,101
-Lisa Rinna.
-Ah, hello, Ru.

537
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,703
I was talking about
Cardi B earlier,

538
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,605
and I remembered
I am wearing a cardi-gan.

539
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,641
This is my Lisa Rinna duster.

540
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,044
So, you know, I love an outfit
that is coming and going.

541
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,014
And speaking of people that
I hate to autocorrect to,

542
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,782
the other Lisa,
my arch-nemesis--

543
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,585
I can't stand her--
it is Lisa Vanderpump.

544
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,521
She has pulled me
into so many of her schemes,

545
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,523
and I'm out,
I'm out, I'm out.

546
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,458
Not a match.

547
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,894
Oh, is it time
to take your vitamins?

548
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,061
Oh, yeah, uh-huh.

549
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:38,130
Do you ever take
Harry's vitamin D?

550
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,633
I take Harry Hamlin's
big vitamin D.

551
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,669
He went right up
in my Melrose Place.

552
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,837
You know what I'm saying?

553
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,272
Absolutely.

554
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,940
Have you met Harry Hamlin?
My husband, Harry Hamlin.

555
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,642
Yeah, from
Clash of the Titans.

556
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,011
Clash of the Titans.
My husband, Harry Hamlin.

557
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:54,213
Let's move on down
to Maria the robot.

558
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,716
Maria, we are looking
for "ducking fitch."

559
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,585
What say you?

560
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,687
Shit.

561
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,190
Oh, God, fucking hands.

562
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,859
So lifelike. Just like us.

563
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,528
Gigi's physical comedy
is hilarious.

564
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,198
Watching her
try to pick up her cards:

565
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,966
comedy gold.

566
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,734
I said "vageena."

567
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,403
Yeah, I think she meant
"vagina."

568
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:20,172
I meant what I said.
[all laugh]

569
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,342
Actually, I went to high school
with a girl named Vageena.

570
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,312
She was a little saucy.

571
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,347
I'm just loving watching
her pick up-- [laughs]

572
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,183
Maria, stop.

573
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,952
You trying to control me?

574
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,020
[all laugh]

575
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,188
How very dare you.

576
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,290
[all laugh]

577
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,992
Let's go on down to Poppy.

578
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,794
What did you write?

579
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,797
I thought Regina George
was a meanie.

580
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:48,968
All right, we're looking
for "ducking fitch," Poppy.

581
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:50,869
I've never heard of that.

582
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,971
Great title for a song.

583
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,939
I'd love to hear you sing it
right now.

584
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,375
They don't let me release
my music without permission.

585
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,444
Well, I think we're giving you
permission right now, Poppy.

586
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,179
-They.
-They.

587
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,715
-[laughs]
-Gotcha.

588
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,149
Ru is giving her bones.

589
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,684
He's, like,
trying to clue her in.

590
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,152
Bitch, I would have been, like,

591
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:10,623
♪ I'm motherfucking Poppy ♪
or something.

592
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:14,326
Let's go on
to Jennifer Holliday.

593
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,262
Mean Girls Regina George
is so mean,

594
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:18,430
when you type her name
into your phone,

595
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:20,532
it autocorrects to what?

596
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,102
And I'm telling you,
Jennifer Hudson.

597
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,536
Jennifer Hudson.

598
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:25,871
Are you friends
with Jennifer Hudson?

599
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,872
Who?

600
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,873
Jennifer Hudson.

601
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,208
-Who?
-Jennifer Hudson.

602
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,610
[laughs]

603
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,711
No.

604
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,380
I guess that answers that.

605
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,816
I hope Brita has a little
more for Jennifer Holliday

606
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,953
than just the... [braying].

607
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,824
Let's move on down to the great
Miss Katharine Hepburn.

608
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:51,330
Well, Ru, I think
the answer is obvious.

609
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,464
What does that say?

610
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,502
Ducking fitch.
[all laugh]

611
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,105
That is a match.

612
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,574
[applause]

613
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,944
Okay. Next question
for Jonathan Bennett.

614
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,681
Michelle Visage is a cool mom.

615
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,717
When her daughters' friends
come over,

616
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:15,220
she doesn't serve ice cream,
she serves blank.

617
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,592
Freshly brewed teabags.

618
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,593
-Not the tea.
-No, teabags.

619
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,362
The teabags.

620
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,397
She's serving
freshly brewed teabags.

621
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,800
Tea. bop. Yep, there you go.

622
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,201
What say you,
Patricia Quinn?

623
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,438
Well, you know,
I still have no clue

624
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,106
what the hell's
going on here, but--

625
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,641
Okay.

626
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,277
I put "a blunt."

627
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:41,180
Because if I had
one of these right now,

628
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,916
I might remember
where the hell I'm at.

629
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,785
Aiden isn't referencing anything
from Rocky Horror,

630
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,921
and none of this is landing.

631
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,255
I don't think anyone
is laughing.

632
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,024
I hear crickets.

633
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,426
Let's go on over to Leslie.

634
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,595
Oh, your hair is different,
Leslie.

635
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,664
Yes, I had to let
the civil rights hair out, Ru.

636
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,933
-Oh.
-Real tight in there.

637
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:03,469
I'm not gonna lie, young man.
This ain't a match.

638
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:06,839
But last time I was here,
I saw Widow's ugly-ass shoe,

639
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,775
and I told her not to wear
this ugly-ass shoe no more.

640
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:11,877
This is hideous.
Just throw it in the trash.

641
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,313
It's one inch away
from being a flat.

642
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,314
Well, not a match.

643
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:18,417
I'm trying
to be your match, baby.

644
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,819
All right,
let's move on down to Cardi B.

645
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,654
Now, Michelle Visage
is a cool mom.

646
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,889
When her daughters' friends
come over,

647
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,125
she doesn't serve ice cream,
she serves what?

648
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,693
Ass.

649
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:31,096
[all laugh]
Okurrr?

650
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,399
I always wave this ass.

651
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,635
-[laughs]
-Oh, okay.

652
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:39,171
Took me from stripper poles
to selling multiplatinum albums.

653
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,506
That's true, very true.

654
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,208
What say you, Bernadette?

655
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,746
She serves them green, green,
nothing but green.

656
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,917
Parsley, peppers, cabbages,
arugula, all of that.

657
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:53,719
-Not a match. Sorry about that.
-Not a match.

658
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,088
Into the Woods
does not match Mean Girls.

659
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,823
Into the woods, around the dell,

660
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,059
behind the bar at Mickey's,
I know it well.

661
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,061
[all laugh]
Yes.

662
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,030
It looks like Ike Turner
has joined us.

663
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,865
Hi, Ike.
Tina was here earlier.

664
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,866
Now Ike is here.

665
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,334
It's Ike and Tina,
Ike and Tina.

666
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,702
What say you, Ike?

667
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,604
She serves them a good old cake.

668
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,440
-Cake.
-You wanna eat the cake?

669
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,507
[all laugh]

670
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:16,975
You wanna eat the cake?

671
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,976
Oh, she's gonna eat it.

672
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,778
I mean, damn,
this is good cake.

673
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,480
Not a match.

674
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,283
All right, let's move on down
to Jennifer Holliday.

675
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:28,554
Michelle Visage doesn't serve
ice cream, she serves...

676
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:30,556
I said "loose jaw."

677
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,524
-[laughs]
-Loose jaw.

678
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:36,428
-Yaaaaah.
-Huh. Loose jaw.

679
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,897
Well, it takes one
to know one, huh?

680
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,732
All right.

681
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,767
Oh, God.

682
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,101
Jennifer Holliday

683
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:47,773
is really
just a loud version of Brita.

684
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,141
Okay, now, Jonathan,

685
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,710
this is a question
that is perfect for you.

686
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,878
Oh, good.

687
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,914
Ross Mathews does not
understand the rules

688
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,749
of his gay softball team.

689
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,986
Instead of hitting the ball,
he blanks it.

690
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,592
I think Ross Mathews
would swallow it.

691
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,594
-Swallow the ball.
-Swallow the ball.

692
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,864
All right, celebrities.
What say you, Lisa?

693
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,966
Oh, my. First of all, Jonathan,
you are very handsome.

694
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:17,803
Not as handsome
as my husband Harry Hamlin.

695
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,706
Harry Hamlin, I love you, baby.

696
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:21,707
Yeah, from L.A. Law.

697
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,375
Harry Hamlin.
Harry Hamlin.

698
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,110
-Have you met my husband?
-Say it one more time.

699
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,881
Harry Hamlin.
Don't talk about my husband!

700
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,749
Harry Hamlin.
I love Harry Hamlin.

701
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,884
Yes. [laughs]

702
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,419
What say you, Lisa?

703
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,688
I gotta say "owns it."

704
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,892
Own it, baby!
Own it! Own it!

705
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,661
Jackie is cracking me up.

706
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,929
Own it, baby!

707
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,399
My husband is Terry Hamilton
or something.

708
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,901
[laughs]

709
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:52,905
Let's move on down
to Maria the robot.

710
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:55,674
Do you know Siri and Alexa?

711
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,676
One second. Searching.

712
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,279
Okay, here's what I've found.

713
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,214
She's my sister, bitch.

714
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,950
[all laugh]

715
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,719
I said he "pegs the ball."

716
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,422
Pegs the ball.
I just learned what pegging is.

717
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,992
Apparently everybody knows
what pegging is except for me.

718
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:16,461
In my day,
it was called fucking.

719
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,462
[all laugh]

720
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,831
Sorry, Maria, not a match.

721
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:22,935
Are you losing it, Maria?

722
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,837
Oh! I smell smoke.

723
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:27,806
There's smoke
coming out of her backside.

724
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,776
Get a fire extinguisher.

725
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,444
Oh! Reboot. Marie, reboot.

726
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,279
[all laugh]

727
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,814
I've seen Brandi Glanville
do that a couple times.

728
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:37,549
-You know what I mean, Ru?
-Yeah. [laughs]

729
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,319
How about you mind
your own fucking business?

730
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,486
Oh! Oh!

731
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,022
[all laugh]

732
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:45,891
All right, let's move on down
to Patricia Quinn,

733
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,527
Rocky Horror Picture Show.

734
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,195
You guys filmed it--
what year was that?

735
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:54,833
Today I thought I was
on the way to the hairdresser,

736
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,502
and look, I'm here, and I don't
even know where I am now.

737
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,904
Oh, okay.

738
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,974
What say you? Ross Mathews,
what does he do with that ball?

739
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,611
Well, much like Ross Mathews,

740
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,981
I do not understand
the rules of the damn game.

741
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,617
So I put he tucks it.

742
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:15,053
He tucks the ball.
Not quite.

743
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:20,058
All right, let's move on down
to the great Katharine Hepburn.

744
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,294
We're looking for
"swallowing balls."

745
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:26,131
I wrote...swallow?

746
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,566
[all laugh]

747
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:31,336
It's a match!
It's a match!

748
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,305
[all laugh]

749
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:35,641
I love being in the movies.

750
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,376
[all laugh]

751
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,111
Poppy, how are you feeling?

752
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,846
Um, I'm feeling good,

753
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,848
and I'm ready
to write a new song.

754
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,283
Oh, good, can't wait to hear it.

755
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,219
Now, what did Ross Mathews
do with that ball?

756
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:51,390
Well, they've never let me play
any kind of sports before,

757
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,992
so I just drew a picture
of a flower

758
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,661
because I love nature.

759
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,997
Well, how about that. Wow.

760
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:02,501
At this point, I don't know if
Crystal's gonna tell any jokes.

761
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,037
Because at this point,
there are no jokes.

762
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,906
It's--it's a moment.

763
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,508
It's something.

764
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,943
Well, that's our show.

765
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,613
That means the winner
of Snatch Game is...

766
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,916
Registered voters.

767
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,052
Because they've earned
the right to bitch

768
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:23,121
and do something about it.vote
sign

769
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:27,392
Until next time, we'll see you
on the Snatch Game.

770
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,061
Say good night, Vanjie.

771
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,495
Bye!

772
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,402
Today is another
elimination day,

773
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,672
and one of these queens
is getting the boot.

774
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,542
Today's runway theme
is Frozen Eleganza,

775
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:47,012
inspired by the Broadway
musical, and I'm so excited.

776
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,081
My look for this is so cool.

777
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,152
Snatch Game, it was not
what I expected at all.

778
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:57,089
Snatch Game
was a whole different animal

779
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,390
than I thought it was gonna be.

780
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,226
But I feel like I did enough
to stay another week.

781
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:03,595
When it was lights, camera,
action, I was just...

782
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,398
[all laugh]

783
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,599
Like, I was just struck.

784
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,568
Once you take the lines
away from us

785
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,370
and we have to start improv-ing,
ooh, girl.

786
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,207
Inside, I was like, aah!

787
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,408
We all know it's coming.

788
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:17,709
This is the one challenge

789
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,644
you have the most time
to prepare for.

790
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,484
I was nervous because Ru didn't
really know who Poppy was.

791
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:26,952
I didn't know who Poppy was,
either.

792
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:29,421
I always just get really nervous
that I'm not gonna do well.

793
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,124
-Poor El DeBarge.
-[laughs]

794
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,225
I'm a fan of Poppy,

795
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,293
and everything that Crystal
was doing

796
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,163
was something that Poppy
would have said or done.

797
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:40,298
I feel so bad for Crystal,

798
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:43,835
because as accurate
as the portrayal of Poppy was,

799
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,137
it just wasn't funny.

800
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,239
Aiden, how are you feeling?

801
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,074
You're being quiet over there.
Talk to us.

802
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,210
I mean, I know my performance

803
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,581
wasn't definitely in the top
this week, by any means.

804
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,084
I'm just gonna focus on today
and see what happens.

805
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,687
I am feeling nervous,
but I am hoping

806
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,157
that there were some
weaker contestants, maybe.

807
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:08,460
And at the end of this,
I will make it through.

808
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,463
But Aiden, come on,
was it her forgetting?

809
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,031
You gotta be straight with us.

810
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,533
In my head, yeah,
there was that moment, like,

811
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,934
I don't know where she lives.

812
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,602
So the easiest thing
for me to do

813
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,604
was, like, the bitch
doesn't, like, remember shit,

814
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,072
so just try to,
like, go to that.

815
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:27,412
My look for this runway is
very cartoony, campy, and fun.

816
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,848
So I'm just hoping
that at the very least

817
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,683
I am safe this challenge.

818
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,388
Did anybody, like,
pick their character

819
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:40,392
because of, like, a personal
connection to the character?

820
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:43,762
I picked, you know, Tina Turner
for the sole purpose

821
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,764
that I've been through
a lot of relationships

822
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:47,799
that were very abusive.

823
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,837
Like, mentally, physically,
emotionally.

824
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,605
Like, I was--
I was homeless for a year.

825
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,073
I slept in
an abandoned building downtown.

826
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,442
Like, I drank
from sunup to sundown

827
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,944
just to get through the day.

828
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,812
The person underneath
all the glitz and glam

829
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,714
has a lot to deal with.

830
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,549
That's why I gravitate to Tina.

831
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,885
I know how that is.

832
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,954
After my mom died,

833
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,989
my uncle kicked me out
because I was gay.

834
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,224
I dropped out of high school,

835
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:15,393
started couch-surfing,
floor-surfing,

836
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,895
boy-surfing.

837
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,764
I dated
a lot of horrible people.

838
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,166
I had to stop, you know,

839
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,169
letting douchebags
treat me like shit.

840
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,039
I think you
just sharing this story

841
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,375
is gonna be empowering
for people to know

842
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,177
that, like, you can rise up.

843
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,513
It's not just Tina Turner,
it's also Widow Von'Du

844
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,749
who, like, got out
of that cycle of abuse.

845
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,585
Drag has given me everything
I've ever wanted in life.

846
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,256
I was able to pull myself out
of having absolutely nothing,

847
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:48,526
being homeless, being verbally
abused and mentally abused.

848
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,830
Drag lifted me
out of all of that.

849
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:55,033
Like now, with my husband
of two years, you know,

850
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,669
I've got a fabulous marriage
and I have a great cat.

851
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,070
Come on, cat!

852
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,573
You've gotta go through some
shit to see some shit.

853
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:02,841
[tongue pop]

854
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,510
I had to learn that
I could be strong on my own,

855
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,145
and to appreciate myself

856
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,914
before someone else
could appreciate me.

857
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,917
She has not just survived,
honey, she has thrived.

858
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,752
And arrived, mama!

859
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:15,020
Good for you, baby.

860
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,155
That's hard.

861
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,660
Of all the characters
we could have chose,

862
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,595
I'm like, you chose a robot.

863
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,663
[all laugh]

864
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,731
I knew it was gonna be risky

865
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,966
because, you know, she's bald.

866
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,367
Like, she's a bald character,

867
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,304
which is definitely
more of a masculine thing,

868
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,508
and I kind of rely so heavily
on looking feminine,

869
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:40,612
and I think that that's
kind of how I feel my best.

870
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:44,950
And I mean, I've kind of always
teetered between male/female

871
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,518
throughout my whole life.

872
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:53,058
I think I really always carry
some sense of female in me,

873
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,460
even when I'm in,
you know, non-drag.

874
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,128
Your non-drag.

875
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,763
Growing up, I've always been
interested in feminine things.

876
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,399
I wanted to wear dresses
to school.

877
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,968
I've kind of always thought

878
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,103
there was no point
to putting a label on anything

879
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,404
in regards to gender.

880
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,707
I don't even think
I've ever said this out loud,

881
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:12,344
but I think I'm fluid.

882
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:15,880
Sometimes I identify
as more male,

883
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,584
and sometimes I identify
as more feminine.

884
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:22,387
I think I'm both
and I'm neither.

885
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,689
I realized
at a very young age, luckily,

886
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,258
that I don't care
what other people think.

887
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,761
-Yeah.
-It's just only made me stronger

888
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,931
and have more faith in who I am.

889
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,433
I'm so thankful to have a mother

890
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,569
that shaped me into
the person that I am today.

891
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,738
When I was 12,

892
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,173
my mother brought me
to my uncle, who is gay.

893
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,476
She took me to his house
in Chicago,

894
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,479
which was full
of orange shag rugs

895
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,948
and egg chairs
hanging from the ceiling

896
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,517
and a giant Game of Life
wheel on the wall.

897
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,887
And it was just like--
it was just like paradise

898
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,289
for somebody like me
in that current mindset.

899
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,693
My uncle was the first person
to talk to me about gay culture,

900
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,230
and LGBTQIA-plus community.

901
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,267
My uncle is the first person
who told me who RuPaul was.

902
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:14,305
He was a big reason why I am
so comfortable with who I am.

903
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:18,109
Ooh, bitch, they can see
my colors today.

904
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:20,945
They'll be like, Heidi,
your makeup has improved.

905
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,815
You are the winner

you look like someone famous?

Oh, you know what,
I get Cate Blanchett a lot.

I would have to do Barney.

Hey, Ru! Sashay, shantay.

932
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:50,068
Oh, they aren't dry,

934
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,239
This week

936
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,444

celebrity impersonations.

937
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,879
And tonight on the runway,

938
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,414

00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,808
Carson: Are those
Dr. Zhiva-gogo boots?

947
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,744
Heidi: She is walking
down that runway,

948
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,412
head held up so high,

949
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:37,215
because, you know, she's the
high empress to the Yeti folk.

950
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,417
She's on her way down
to the ski resort,

951
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,320
and she's hoping
to find her a husband

952
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,956
so he can help carry
her big muff around.

953

the cold shoulder, you guys.

on this for just a minute.

Daniel: Snowflake it
till you make it.

960
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,807
Jackie: The inspiration
for my Frozen Eleganza

961
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,475
is Elsa's crown.

962
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,477
The petals are to the metal.

963
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,447
I'm being very brave
in wearing bright blonde hair

964
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,649
for the first and maybe
only time on this runway.

965
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:14,285
Not really my color,
but I think I'm making it work.

Naughty, but ice.

Jaida: In this look,
I am Frozen to the core.

976
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:35,306
I am up all of north,
and what's left of Antarctica--

977
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,742
Antarctica's at the bottom,
ain't it?

978
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,912
I am giving you whatever
is left of the polar ice caps.

979
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:43,248
I just feel a fantasy
of, like, ice goddess,

980
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:46,751
frozen, naked,
and beautiful, okay?

981
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,919
Jonathan:
Storm in a snowstorm.

982
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,587
RuPaul:
Well, you know what they say:

983
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,322
beware of black ice.

Jan: For this runway, Elsa,
she's gonna go off

989
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,435
and become a White Walker
from Game of Thrones.

990
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,872
I am dripping
in silicone icicles.

991
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,974
I can do conceptual looks.

992
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,577
I'm not afraid
to go to those places.

993
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,078
Jonathan: I've heard
of having cold feet,

994
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,847
but this is ridiculous.

995
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,715

what I'm serving,

I'm feeling frozen,

RuPaul: Gigi Goode.

1013

She got 31 flavors,
but a bitch ain't one.

1014

Carson: Is that soft-serve?
Because I like it hard.

1015
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,960
Gigi: Tonight I'm just that
fun-loving ice cream woman

1016
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,595
who is coming down the street.

1017
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,597
My ice cream brings
all the boys to the yard,

1018
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,600
and I feel so goddamn cute.

1019
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,569
My nose is pink because
it's chilly in here.

1020
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,706
I wanna show the judges that
not only can I be fashionable,

1021
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:18,576
I can be campy and I can
also think outside the box.

from the old Christmas
Claymation cartoons.

1032
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,866
I'm feeling goofy,
I'm feeling campy,

1033
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:46,471
and I am serving this little
Frozen treat to the judges.

Yeti Davis eyes.

00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:04,022
Carson: One in the mink...

1043
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,623
[all laugh]

1044
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:08,159
Brita: This hot bitch
is ice cold.

1045
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,795
The entire gown is iridescent,

1046
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:14,365
and I am serving you every
single color of the rainbow.

1047
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,803
I am like a gender reveal party
in the snow.

1048
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:22,807
You don't know if it's blue
or pink or orange.

1049
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,675
Goddamn, I look gorgeous.

1050
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:27,044
RuPaul:
Oh, look at all that ice.

1051
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,513
Michelle: Coldie Hawn.

1052
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,149
[all laugh]

1053
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:32,617
RuPaul: Crystal Methyd.

1054
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:35,353
Michelle: There's no business
like snow business.

1055
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,355
Crystal: I am really excited to
show this look to the judges.

1056
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:40,024
I'm wearing the most elegant
pair of pajamas

1057
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,026
that have ever been made.

1058
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:43,428
My runway look is inspired

1059
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:45,530
by Mr. Freeze
from Batman & Robin.

1060
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,532
I've added glitter
all over my lashes,

1061
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:49,901
and I look like I've just
been blown in the face

1062
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,170
by a blizzard.

1063
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,338
Michelle: Glacier?
I hardly know her.

1064
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,041
Carson:
I own 51% of Antarctica.

1065
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,644
[all laugh]

1066
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:03,347
Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

1067
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,118
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1068
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,556
Heidi.

1069
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:13,424
Jaida Essence Hall.

1070
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:16,994
Jan.

1071
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,264
The Widow Von'Du.

1072
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,366
Ladies, you are all safe.

1073
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,970
You may leave the stage.

1074
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:33,211
Ladies, you all

1075
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:36,647
represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

1076
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:39,083
It's time
for the judges' critiques,

1077
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:42,987
starting with Jackie Cox.

1078
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:44,689
This look on the runway
is great.

1079
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:47,325
The skirt, very pretty,
beautiful fabric,

1080
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,826
looks like liquid silver.

1081
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,827
Very effective, very beautiful.

1082
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,396
I absolutely loved
your Lisa Rinna.

1083
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,332
-You know what I'm saying?
-I thought it was hysterical.

1084
00:43:54,332 --> 00:43:57,235
You went for every joke
that you could,

1085
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:58,236
and I thought you really shined.

1086
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,837
As a comedian, you want somebody

1087
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,239
that can play back with you,

1088
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:03,374
and you were hitting every
volley that someone threw you.

1089
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,776
Though not every laugh landed,

1090
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:09,080
you went for every single
opportunity you had.

1091
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,682
Good conviction and good
commitment to a character.

1092
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,850
Thank you.

1093
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,585
You work with the entire group
really well.

1094
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:17,121
You really did your homework,
you knew a lot about her.

1095
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:19,891
Wearing her cardigan from QVC
was very smart.

1096
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:21,726
You used props
and you used costuming

1097
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:23,027
and you used makeup
and you used hair

1098
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,229
to tell us that story,
and it worked.

1099
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,864
Thank you, Carson.

1100
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:28,900
Up next, Gigi Goode.

1101
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,301
Good morning.

1102
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,770
This runway look,
the silhouette is really great,

1103
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,472
the fit is perfect.

1104
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,407
I like the little pink nose.

1105
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:39,176
It's the details with you
that I look for.

1106
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,244
Good job tonight.

1107
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,013
Your performance was fantastic,

1108
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:45,316
and I thought it was one of the
silent but deadly performances

1109
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:46,384
of the night.

1110
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:47,618
You knew enough
about the actual robot

1111
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,221
to be able to do
some spoofy things,

1112
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,889
and you were picking up jokes
and taking them.

1113
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,558
I thought you did a great job.

1114
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:55,092
Well, you made her naughty,
which I love.

1115
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,961
I didn't expect you
to be, like, you know,

1116
00:44:56,961 --> 00:45:00,631
calling Ru a bitch,
which made me laugh very hard.

1117
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,934
You landed all the jokes, and
I thought that was brilliant.

1118
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:06,203
I loved how you were
completely committed.

1119
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,573
When the camera's not on you,

1120
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:10,241
you were still in it
and still over here--

1121
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:13,010
The funniest part was
you fumbling with your cards.

1122
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,445
Huge hit for me.

1123
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:17,014
I was worried about you
after the walkthrough,

1124
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:21,018
but, oh, my goodness,
it was so funny.

1125
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,454
It was unexpected.
Home run.

1126
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:24,989
Thank you so much.

1127
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,824
Up next, Aiden Zhane.

1128
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,092
Hello.

1129
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,427
As far as your runway look,

1130
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:31,896
I love cartoon stuff,
and I thought it was adorable.

1131
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,531
I think it was a cute idea,

1132
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:36,167
but I do think
it's really rather simple.

1133
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:39,537
Let's talk about Snatch Game
Patricia Quinn.

1134
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,205
You kept hitting dead ends,

1135
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,474
and that doesn't work
in Snatch Game.

1136
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,409
I felt like Ru was throwing you
all these things,

1137
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,511
and you were swatting them
to the floor.

1138
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:48,980
When you say, "I don't know,"

1139
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:51,782
it's a full-stop dead end for
whoever's performing with you.

1140
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,351
And we just
want more out of you.

1141
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,486
What made you choose
Patricia Quinn?

1142
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:56,921
She's somebody that I have met,

1143
00:45:56,921 --> 00:46:00,091
so I kind of have
a firsthand knowledge of her.

1144
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,561
So you met her, then you know
she has a British accent.

1145
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:05,429
-Yes. [chuckles]
-Okay, just checking.

1146
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,833
Did you have any preparation
done on her?

1147
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,334
Not, like, specifics,

1148
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,770
as far as, like, the year
the movie was filmed.

1149
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,474
But it was more so just trying
to take her characteristics

1150
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:19,677
and turn them into
a bigger character, I guess,

1151
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:20,978
is what I had tried to do.

1152
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,713
Didn't work.

1153
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,348
-I'm aware.
-Okay, good.

1154
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,084
Rocky Horror is very dear
to a lot of us in here.

1155
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,185
I feel like a smarter choice

1156
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,787
would have been to do her
as Magenta.

1157
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,255
Maybe it might have been easier.

1158
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,523
I gave it my best shot,

1159
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:37,628
but unfortunately
I completely missed the mark.

1160
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,165
Up next, Brita.

1161
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,501
This runway look, I love.

1162
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,102
I think it's opalensce--

1163
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,438
Opalescence.
[all laugh]

1164
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:48,439
She earned everything.

1165
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:50,374
-Yes, you do.
-Yes, you do.

1166
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,877
But to me,
it does say Frozen Eleganza.

1167
00:46:52,877 --> 00:46:54,578
So that was a big success.

1168
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:59,650
You chose the great singer
Jennifer Holliday.

1169
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,052
Mm-hmm.

1170
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:05,456
You looked great, but it was
just one note that went nowhere.

1171
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:08,392
And I'm telling you,
I'm not buying it.

1172
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:09,393
[all laugh]

1173
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,495
I love you and I love her,

1174
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,397
but it just--
that wasn't working for me.

1175
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,900
You kind of worked yourself
into a corner, unfortunately.

1176
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,202
I know, a cornapple
that I don't wanna be in.

1177
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,470
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

1178
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,538
The past two weeks,
I've been in the bottom,

1179
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,840
so I've kind of been in my head.

1180
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,910
People hold me at a high
standard in New York City,

1181
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,645
and I'm their queen,
essentially.

1182
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,348
And I'm just so--
I was upset with myself

1183
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,516
because I wasn't doing
such a great job here.

1184
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,585
And I just froze.
I froze on the set.

1185
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,953
I, like, didn't know what to do.

1186
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:37,722
Is there anything
in the werkroom

1187
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,790
I could have said to you
that would have helped?

1188
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,592
I was listening
to everything that you said

1189
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:42,927
to every girl in the room.

1190
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:46,564
You said everything
in order for us to succeed,

1191
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,433
but did a bitch listen?
I don't know.

1192
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,503
I try to let you kids
know in advance

1193
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,739
what to expect
when you're expecting.

1194
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,542
[all laugh]

1195
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:02,580
Thank you, Brita. All right,
up next, Crystal Methyd.

1196
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,583
This look, is that Ice-Escada?

1197
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,785
You are so stupid.

1198
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,787
-It's Esca--It's an old lady
brand.
-It's a fashion joke.

1199
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,922
Anyway, I love
that it's tailored,

1200
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,457
I love the material,

1201
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,660
that there's a lot of Lurex
to kind of give us that sparkle.

1202
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,696
I frigging love this outfit.
It's so chic.

1203
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:19,997
Thank you.

1204
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,832
Watching your performance
of Poppy in Snatch Game,

1205
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,501
I didn't know
what I was watching.

1206
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,070
And then I went home
and googled Poppy,

1207
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,738
and I watched her videos,

1208
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,441
and I still didn't know
what I was watching.

1209
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:33,410
[all laugh]

1210
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,745
I have two teenage daughters,

1211
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:38,015
so I have been obsessed
with Poppy for a long time.

1212
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:42,086
I just think because so many
people don't know who Poppy is,

1213
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:45,456
you then have
to make Poppy crazier...

1214
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:48,325
-Yeah.
-Bigger, funnier.

1215
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:50,227
Some of the jokes I wasn't
understanding, you know,

1216
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,062
and I wasn't getting
enough funny.

1217
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,831
You were thinking
a little bit too much.

1218
00:48:53,831 --> 00:49:00,171
Actually, my concern
for the robot with Gigi

1219
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:01,405
is actually
what happened to you.

1220
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:05,042
Sorry I wasn't able
to throw it back at you.

1221
00:49:05,042 --> 00:49:07,044
Had you done El DeBarge,
like I asked you--

1222
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:09,880
I know!
[all laugh]

1223
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,982
-All right, thank you, Crystal.
-Thank you.

1224
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:14,318
Up next, Sherry Pie.

1225
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,853
Tonight on the runway,
this is really fantastic.

1226
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:18,722
It's still quintessentially you,

1227
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,257
but you look different,
which is wonderful.

1228
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,092
I loved your performance
in the Snatch Game.

1229
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,627
Ducking fitch.

1230
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,164
-You are so funny.
-Thank you.

1231
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,233
Even she would have enjoyed
that performance.

1232
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:33,070
The visual was kind of similar
to the mother in Gay's Anatomy,

1233
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,141
but it was still Katharine,
and it was just wonderful.

1234
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,610
Yeah, the only place
I can fault you there

1235
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:42,680
was that the makeup
maybe was a little--

1236
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,149
it still looked
a little Waylon and Madame-y.

1237
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,819
For the people at home,
Waylon and Madame--

1238
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,856
Right, right.
She was the Poppy of the 1970s.

1239
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:54,191
Yeah. That's right.

1240
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,893
And you're welcome.

1241
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,095
[all laugh]

1242
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,497
Well, thank you, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

1243
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,867
While you untuck backstage,

1244
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:05,135
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1245
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:08,973
Okay, now just between
us mean girls,

1246
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,708
what do you think?

1247
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,176
Jackie Cox.

1248
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,911
Jackie was so funny,

1249
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,480
and I am a sucker
for a prop comic,

1250
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,184
and she had not one, not two,
but four or five prop gags.

1251
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,621
And a pratfall and a prop gag,
you got me.

1252
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,522
I would have gone
with the lips even bigger,

1253
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,758
but she was great
because she went for it,

1254
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:28,893
and I love that about her.

1255
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,394
Gigi Goode.

1256
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:31,829
I liked the juxtaposition

1257
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:34,231
of seeing her as somebody cold
and mechanical as the robot,

1258
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,733
and then seeing her,
like, warm and friendly

1259
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,167
as the little ice cream girl.

1260
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,969
I thought she was great and
it was a great night for her.

1261
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,071
She was really, really funny.

1262
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:42,473
What's up, bitch?

1263
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:45,776
Gigi Goode has proven again
that she is smart,

1264
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,645
she's on top of things,
and she is confident.

1265
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:49,980
She has what it takes
to back it up.

1266
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,283
All right, let's move on down
to Aiden Zhane.

1267
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:55,185
I've been kind of obsessed with
Aiden since the show started.

1268
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,655
There's something really great
and pure about Aiden

1269
00:50:57,655 --> 00:50:59,223
that I love.

1270
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,358
But the Snatch Game was
definitely not her thing.

1271
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,860
She was in character, though.

1272
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,596
She didn't break character,
so I'll give her credit for
that.

1273
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:07,197
She was consistent.

1274
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:10,334
She just didn't understand
the improv and the humor

1275
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:11,335
that is Snatch Game.

1276
00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,737
Yes. Brita, please.

1277
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,272
Brita, I think
in the Snatch Game

1278
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:18,943
was kind of reminiscent
of her vibe in Gay's Anatomy,

1279
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,544
where it was a bit one-note.

1280
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:23,113
And you almost lose her
a little bit.

1281
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,316
She doesn't pop
in these kind of group numbers.

1282
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:26,850
Sometimes when
you're parodying someone

1283
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,119
that doesn't have very much
of a public persona,

1284
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,888
you've just gotta give them,
like, a plus-one.

1285
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,589
Like she's this,
plus she's angry,

1286
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,992
or she's this,
plus she's, like, slutty.

1287
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,727
Just give us one more plus.
It doesn't even have to be true.

1288
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,563
Yes. Crystal Methyd.

1289
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,165
She wasn't telling us enough
about this character.

1290
00:51:41,165 --> 00:51:42,299
Like, tell us who it is.

1291
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:44,702
Oh, just working on new music.

1292
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:45,970
Let us all become Poppy fans.

1293
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,739
She didn't give us enough
to really sell it.

1294
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:50,708
It just wasn't that funny.

1295
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,009
You know, do whoever you want,
but make it funny.

1296
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:55,379
The bottom line
is where are the jokes?

1297
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,314
Where are the jokes?

1298
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:59,016
Sherry Pie.

1299
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:00,884
This ducking fitch.

1300
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:04,221
[all laugh]
She gave us great theater.

1301
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,790
I thought she was so funny,
so good.

1302
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,293
She's chosen even
an old-school kind of icon,

1303
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,195
which was a smart choice.

1304
00:52:11,195 --> 00:52:14,798
Jonathan, who would you do
on the Snatch Game?

1305
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,368
Oh, Ru, I'd do
Valerie Cherish

1306
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:21,605
on RuPaul's Drag--drag--
RuPaul's Drag Races, you know?

1307
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,274
So... No, no, you're wrong,
it's Drag Race.

1308
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,610
So we're doing
RuPaul's Drag Race.

1309
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,911
-So you know--
-You knew that.

1310
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,947
Mark! No, you can't use that.

1311
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,448
You can't use that, Jane. Jane!

00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:42,659
I've made my--
I've made my decision!

1316
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,364
Bring back my girls.

1317
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,734
Welcome back, ladies.

1318
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,070
I've made some decisions.

1319

Gigi Goode,

winner of this week's challenge.

[applause]
Yes!

1323
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,219
Fuck.

1324
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,190
You've won a cash prize
of $5.000.

1325
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,692
Oh, my God.

1326
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,728
I won Snatch Game.

1327
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,930
That's huge.

1328
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,465
Thank you so much.

Thank you.

1335
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,592
Aiden Zhane, your Snatch Game
was a bit of a rocky horror.

1336
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:54,565
Brita, your Snatch Game
was no dream, girl.

Crystal Methyd,
your Poppy just didn't pop.

Crystal Methyd...

00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,480
You're safe.

00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,015

Aiden, Brita,
I'm sorry, my dears,

1343
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:26,096
but you are up for elimination.

1344
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:30,200
I am up against
a powerhouse performer.

1345
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,537
I need to slay this
if I am going to stay here.

1346
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:37,841
Two queens stand before me.

1347

Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1348
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:47,117

from elimination.

Brita, shantay you stay.

1386
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,880
Thank you.

1387
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,416
You may join the other girls.

1388
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,486
Good job. You slayed
the competition.

1389
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,587
-Love you.
-Thanks, babe.

1390
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,926
Aiden, you are a queen
with a special power.

1391
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:45,762
Never let it go.

1392
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,398
Now sashay away.

1393
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:52,903
I just wanna say
that I am truly sorry

1394
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:56,006
that I have not been able
to break free

1395
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:58,942
of the voices and the things
going on in my head.

1396
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,210
Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

1397
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,745
Thank you.

[applause]

1399
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,920
And also I will not
leave this competition

1400
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,288
being the quiet bitch.

1401
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:13,123

1402
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:17,394

-Yes!

1405
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,837
It sucks.
It sucks to be going home.

1406
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:29,439
But I am going
to hold my head high,

1407
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,640
I am going to be proud

1408
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,776
of what I was able to present
to the world.

1409
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:37,114
Being in any kind of sisterhood
with other drag queens

1410
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,315
can get messy.

1411
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,684

1415
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:54,831

don't eat yellow snow.

how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1419
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:01,938
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

1420
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:02,973
