28

and...

She's one of my best friends, and...

36
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,236
have their dream stripped away from them.

37
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,706
[Jackie] Gigi, you've won three times.
This is incredible.

-[Sherry] Third time's a charm, honey.
-[Gigi] Third time's a--

39
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,310
Well, hopefully there's gonna be
a fourth and fifth and sixth, like--

40
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:44,179
-A fourth and fifth and sixth?
-[laughing]

41
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:45,080
[Jaida] Okay.

42
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,248
I'm so happy that you won,

43
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,683
but I'm really surprised that,
Jan, this wasn't your week.

44
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,918
I--

45
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,389
I'm frustrated because
this is, like, what I do.

46
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,858
I'm a singer. I dance, I perform.

47
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:58,860
Like, that's my thing.

48
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,796
I want to win those challenges.

49
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,399
I want to win<i> a </i>challenge.

50
00:02:04,466 --> 00:02:07,135
And I thought that
this was gonna be the one.

51
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:09,571
I really wanted that win.

52
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:10,939
<i>I'm frustrated.</i>

53
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>I'm angry.</i>

54
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:13,942
I'm crushed.

55
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,810
[Jaida] When Jan was called safe,

56
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:18,446
I could see on her face
it was like, "Girl."

57
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,515
Not only did I not win the challenge,

58
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,718
but my best friend
just went home, so I'm like...

59
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:27,122
[sniffles]

60
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:30,525
It sucks. It really sucks.

61
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:35,096
[sniffles] Like, but
the worst part about it is that

62
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:37,465
my best friend just went home.

63
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,001
[Jaida]<i> Yeah, she's a little salty
that her friend left</i>

64
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:43,838
but I'm thinking
she's a little bit more upset

65
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,007
that she had not won this challenge.

66
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:50,745
Everyone back at home is gonna be
so upset that she went home

67
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:54,182
and at least,
if there was any consolation,

68
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:56,885
it could have been
that I would've won this challenge.

69
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,253
And it just,

70
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,955
it-- it sucks.

71
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:03,258
[Jackie] I think this is
a build-up of weeks and weeks

72
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,594
of her not breaking through to the judges.

73
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,363
<i>She also says
she's really upset about Brita,</i>

74
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,332
but I think it's more that she's upset

75
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:14,703
that neither her nor Brita have been
able to live up to their reputation.

76
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:18,039
[Jackie] We're just gonna have to
keep pushing ourselves.

77
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,875
You have to keep selling
what you do the best

78
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,545
every challenge,
no matter what the challenge is.

79
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,947

that they gonna be that star,

80
00:03:26,014 --> 00:03:28,883
and they gonna be that bitch,
and they gonna win, win, win, win, win.

too cocky about the challenge wins

00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:26,754
Now, I know the judges are always saying
that your make up is just, um...

178
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:28,723
-terrible.
-[laughing]

179
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,394
So I got you the season one filter, okay?

180
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:36,998
It's just a towel that you
put over the lens of the camera.

181
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:37,932
[laughing]

182
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,001
Thank you.

183
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,837
Miss Jaida, I got something for you, too.

184
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,373
Now listen, I got you this lotion...

185
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,708
Oh, it is perfect.

186
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:49,310
And it's cruelty-free,

187
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,313
unlike your performance
as Cardi B in<i> The Snatch Game</i>

188
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,682
which was really cruel for us to watch.

189
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,017
[laughing]

190
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:56,985
Stop it.

191
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,890
Gigi, I got you
this face purifying cleanser

192
00:08:01,956 --> 00:08:04,792
so you can wash both of your faces.

193
00:08:05,393 --> 00:08:06,294
[Jackie] But which face is it?

194
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,696
The face of the one win, or the other win?

195
00:08:08,763 --> 00:08:10,765
-Or maybe it's the third?
-The third?

196
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:12,467
Or the no win.

197
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,568
[laughing]

198
00:08:13,735 --> 00:08:14,569
Oh!

199
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:18,339
Sister, I've always told you
you were so beautiful

200
00:08:18,406 --> 00:08:19,641
and you're like a work of art to me.

201
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,676
You know that one where they're like...
[screams]

202
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,945
Screaming, yes, honey.

203
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,114
So what I did,
was I wanted to frame your face a little,

204
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,448
so I bought you
these beautiful sunglasses.

205
00:08:27,515 --> 00:08:29,484
-Oh, try them on really quickly.
-[Jackie] Gorgeous.

206
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,485
Oh... [gasps]

207
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,821
And look, you've never looked
more beautiful, Jaida.

208
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,658
Oh, this has been<i> so </i>fun.

209
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:37,992
Well, you guys have a great day.

210
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,927
We're gonna say goodbye.

211
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,962
-Goodbye, ladies.
-Goodbye, girls.

212
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,497
-[Gigi] Sluts.
-Uh, whores.

213
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,165
[laughing]

214
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,902
Next up, Heidi and Jan.

215
00:08:47,969 --> 00:08:51,172
You'll be kiking with Widow and Sherry.

216
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:54,409
[overlapping] Hi!

217
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,911
It's so nice to see... you.

218
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:00,148
[Sherry] Well, um,
we actually curated this box

219
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:03,184
from FabFitFun for you ladies,

220
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,218
-isn't it cute--
-You're so kind.

221
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:06,621
Well, somebody has to be kind to you--

222
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:08,389
'Cause life has not been at all.

223
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:12,126
We also curated a box from FabFitFun

224
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:13,528
-just for you.
-Yeah.

225
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,829
[Sherry] Oh, fabulous.

226
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:19,834
Sherry, you're just such a strong,
independent and handsome drag queen,

227
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:22,437
so I just got you this blanket.

228
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:24,305
Wow, it's very heavy.

229
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:25,273
Just like you.

230
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,207
[laughing]

231
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,843
[Widow] Heidi, I know
that you got a lot of shit

232
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,879
from pretty much everyone
about how busted your mug is.

233
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,716
-Oh.
-So I felt I should get you a new mug.

234
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,284
[laughing]

235
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:37,752
[Widow] Try not to crack this one.

236
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:38,686
[laughing]

237
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:41,189
Miss Widow,
I actually got you some luggage,

238
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:43,925
you know, to help you pack
when you get sent home.

239
00:09:43,992 --> 00:09:46,694
-[snorts]
-Yet I've been safe, mostly.

240
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:48,363
Safe, just coasting, yeah.

241
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:50,798
-[laughing]
-[Jaida] Oh, bitch.

242
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,868
My darling, I know
how much you've been struggling

243
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:56,371
with your best friend
leaving the competition.

244
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:57,438
[laughing]

245
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,507
[Jan] At least I have some friends.

246
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:03,077
And so I got you this lovely terrarium,

247
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,612
I thought we could put some plants in it

248
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,948
and you can water it
with your salty crocodile tears.

249
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,449
[laughing]

250
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:10,451
This was so lovely to catch up.

251
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:11,552
Give us a call...

252
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:12,587
-never.
-Never.

253
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,621
[laughing]

254
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,023
[Sherry] Bye, girls.

255
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,924
[RuPaul] Wow.

256
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,160
You were all so giving.

257
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,230
The winners
of today's mini challenge are...

258
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:24,298
[drum roll]

259
00:10:25,233 --> 00:10:27,301
Jackie Cox and Gigi Goode.

260
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:28,703
-Ah.
-[applause]

261
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,637
Sister.

262
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:31,339
[RuPaul] Con-drag-ulations.

263
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,009
FabFitFun is providing $1,000

264
00:10:35,076 --> 00:10:38,312
and a one-year subscription to you both.

265
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:41,315
-[cheering]
-[Jackie] Fabulous, thank you.

266
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:43,751
I finally won a mini challenge!

267
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:48,256
Look, it's not the challenge win,
but I'll take that $1,000 gift card.

268
00:10:48,322 --> 00:10:49,957
[electronic music playing]

269
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:55,296
Ladies,<i> Drag Race</i>
turns queens into stars.

270
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,633
And today's biggest stars
create their own

271
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,702
lifestyle, beauty, and wellness brands.

272
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:03,838
So, for today's maxi challenge,

273
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:06,274
you need to think like a star

274
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,410
and create a ridiculously extravagant,

275
00:11:09,477 --> 00:11:12,513
and totally unnecessary product

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,350
for a new drag queen
lifestyle brand we're calling...

277
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:17,652
<i>droop.</i>

278
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,120
[laughing]

279
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,089
#DragRace

280
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:24,225
Now, after you create your posh product,

281
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,727
you need to sell it
in your own commercial.

282
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:29,497
Now, I shop at droop all the time.

283
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,032
-[beeping]
-Oh, what is that?

284
00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:36,337
Oh, it's time to pull out
the solid gold goose egg

285
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,906
that I keep, um, between me down there.

286
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:39,907
[laughing]

287
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,645
It helps keep my biorhythms
in sync with the stock market.

288
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:46,047
Thanks, droop.

289
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:46,948
[laughing]

290
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:50,118
Now, gentlemen, start your engines,

291
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:52,854
and may the best woman win.

292
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,788
[beeping]

293
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,189
Oh, it's beeping again.

294
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,524
[laughing]

295
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,728
This challenge is all about
personality and selling yourself,

296
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,330
<i>and coming off of last week,</i>

297
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:05,266
<i>I have to show the judges
what makes me special.</i>

298
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,869
We will see if I achieve that.

299
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,505
[dramatically] Dun-dun-dun.

300
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:15,243
Child. Y'all ready to sell your brand?

301
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,811
<i>For this week's maxi challenge,
we have to come up with</i>

302
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:20,314
an over-the-top upper echelon product,

303
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,218
they're asking for a whole hell of a lot
and it's going down now.

304
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,954
This challenge is
so opposite of me, like...

305
00:12:27,021 --> 00:12:30,291
This is for, like,
boujee rich people.

306
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,660
And, Heidi, I made $9,000 last year.

307
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,464
-[Jaida] Working where?
-At my job at a gas station.

308
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:38,633
-[Widow] Just nine?
-Oh, my God.

309
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,369
Upper echelon...
I don't know how to spell echelon.

310
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:42,603
[laughing]

311
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,604
Girl.

312
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:45,573
Hey, kitty girls.

313
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,574
[queens] Hey.

314
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,142
We got company.

315
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:50,144
-Hi everybody.
-[queens] Hey.

316
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,046
Give a big<i> Drag Race </i>welcome

317
00:12:52,113 --> 00:12:54,982
to health and fitness guru, Bob Harper.

318
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:56,918
[queens] Hi, Bob.

319
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,453
Bob's here to help me help you.

320
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,888
Sickening.

321
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,057
Well, hello, Miss Heidi.

322
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:06,827
You know, you have done very well
in the personality department

323
00:13:06,894 --> 00:13:08,329
in this competition.

324
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:12,633
How are you gonna
infuse Heidi into this product?

325
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,204
Um, my brand is
Heidi's Multipurpose Lotion.

326
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,673
[whistling] Soft and supple.

327
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:19,740
[laughing]

328
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,275
Thank God for that gap
between your teeth

329
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,844
-so you can say that right.
-Oh, honey, it's come in handy many times.

330
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:26,847
Now, there's
a lot of products called soft and supple.

331
00:13:26,914 --> 00:13:27,748
-Is there?
-[RuPaul] Yeah.

332
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:30,051
You need to get your ass out of Ramsuer.

333
00:13:30,117 --> 00:13:31,385
[laughing]

334
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:34,388
So, are you saying that Heidi's lotion is

335
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:36,357
hy-dra-ting?

336
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:37,491
[ding]

337
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:39,327
That could by my new name.
[laughs]

338
00:13:39,393 --> 00:13:41,062
Did you not think of Hydrating Heidi?

339
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,564
-No, I did not.
-Oh, my goodness.

340
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:44,565
Is that trademarked now by you?

341
00:13:44,632 --> 00:13:47,168
It's not, but I--
Yeah, I'll see your ass in court.

342
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,069
[laughing]

343
00:13:48,135 --> 00:13:49,537
[Bob] When you're selling something,

344
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:52,106
you gotta take that name
and what your product is

345
00:13:52,173 --> 00:13:54,308
and you gotta somehow
meld those two worlds together,

346
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,179
so when people are thinking of their
product, they have Heidi's face in mind.

347
00:13:58,246 --> 00:14:00,281
Now, Heidi,
you were in the bottom

348
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:01,249
last week.
-[Heidi] Yes.

349
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:04,085
[RuPaul] You haven't won
any challenges yet.

350
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:06,120
You better get out there,
you better act your ass.

351
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,521
All right, I can't wait.

352
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,623
-All right, thank you.
-Thank you.

353
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:09,790
-Bye.
-Bye.

354
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,197
[Heidi]<i> I'm not a thief, Mama Ru.</i>

355
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:20,701
Imma give you 2.3 per cent
of all Heidi's Hydrates sales.

356
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:22,703
I think that's a generous deal

357
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,639
<i>and I'm looking forward
to doing business with you, partner.</i>

358
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:28,843
-Hi, Widow.
-Hi, Ru.

359
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,877
Meet Bob Harper.

360
00:14:29,944 --> 00:14:31,646
-Hi, Bob, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

361
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:32,847
So, now, what is your product?

362
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,349
My brand's called ThroatÉ.

363
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,486
My revolutionary throat-coating spray.
'Cause you're gagging.

364
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:40,488
Do you have a gag reflex?

365
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:43,457
I mean, you don't get to be this size and
you can't shove things down your throat.

366
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:45,026
[laughing]

367
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:48,362
Now, does it have
more than just one use?

368
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,497
Yes, it does.

369
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:53,567
It could be used
as a setting spray, mace...

370
00:14:54,335 --> 00:14:56,737
Maybe you wanna do some
extracurricular activities and need to...

371
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,272
Okay, all right.

372
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,242
Now, Widow, so far, you won one challenge.

373
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,910
You haven't won any since.

374
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:06,681
What do you think has held you back?

375
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:10,718
I-- Quite honestly, I don't know.

376
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:15,189
What I have to do
with everything that I brand myself with

377
00:15:15,256 --> 00:15:16,757
is really stay true to who I am.

378
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,993
[RuPaul] Just make sure
you bring the funny.

379
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,862
Ru says I haven't
touched the top in a while,

380
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,166
that's pretty much all the fuck
I'm thinking about right now.

381
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,934
I'm feeling some type of way, like,

382
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,404
I didn't come here just to,
you know, fade in the background.

383
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:33,507
-Hi, Jan.
-Hi, Ru.

384
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:35,376
Tell me about your product.
Tell me what you got.

385
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,945
My product is called Sure, Jan.

386
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:41,349
If you feel like Jan Brady
and you wanna be a little more Marcia,

387
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:42,783
then, girl, we just gotta spritz

388
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,185
and then you're feeling the "Jan-tasy."

389
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:46,987
You could really attract
a whole group of people that

390
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,656
are kind of, like, you know,

391
00:15:48,723 --> 00:15:51,625
the quiet little person that goes,
"I wanna be just like Jan."

392
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:54,328
Now, you came close
to winning last week.

393
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:56,497
-I did.
-And you got very emotional.

394
00:15:56,564 --> 00:16:01,102
I did. I was upset to see
one of my best friends leave.

395
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,972
-It sucks.
-It's not<i> RuPaul's Best Friends Race</i>.

396
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,074
-It's not, and that's why--
-Gotta think like a winner.

397
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,145
If anything,
it's a good thing that Brita's gone

398
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:12,880
because now I don't
have to worry about her.

399
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,815
<i>And now that she's gone,</i>

400
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:17,651
I'm really gonna push it to the judges.

401
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:20,287
-Just make sure you bring the funny, okay?
-Mm-hmm, I will.

402
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,789
All right, we'll see you out there.

403
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:23,424
-See you, Jan.
-Bye, guys.

404
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,760
Hey, J. Cox.

405
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:27,595
What is your product?

406
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,197
Jackie's Magic Carpet Merkins.

407
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:32,833
[RuPaul] So, I see that you've taken
the Middle Eastern theme

408
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,001
and you've run with that.

409
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,170
I ran with it,
and growing up, there isn't very much

410
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:39,140
Middle Eastern representation,
at least in things that I can watch on TV.

411
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,040
Uh-huh.

412
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,276
But, in the very first episode
of<i> I Dream of Jeannie,</i>

413
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:44,712
Barbara Eden actually speaks Persian.

414
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:45,613
Really?

415
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,082
For me, that was like,
oh, my God, I know what she's saying,

416
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:51,218
you know, and there was this moment
I'd never seen anyone

417
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,721
-who spoke Perisan or Farsi on TV before--
-[RuPaul] Yeah.

418
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:55,689
So I fell in love with that character.

419
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:58,292
Barbara Eden played
the character of the genie

420
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,360
in<i> I Dream of Jeannie</i>.

421
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:00,694
<i>I love her as an icon,</i>

422
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:04,999
and I really admire the way
she's embraced the character of Jeannie,

423
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,467
now 50 years later.

424
00:17:06,534 --> 00:17:08,836
Why would someone need a merkin?

425
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,338
Well, you know, sometimes
the between-me-down-theres

426
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,107
-don't get enough attention.
-That's right.

427
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:16,644
Sometimes you can really zhuzh it up
with a magic carpet merkin.

428
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,248
This is the type of challenge that
seems to me it's either gonna go so well

429
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:23,584
or it is going to crash and burn.

430
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:28,222
So, it's gonna be really interesting
to see you sell this merkin.

431
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,123
We'll see you out there.

432
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,357
-[Jackie] Thanks, you guys.
-Thank you.

433
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:34,228
[RuPaul] Now, listen up, ladies.

434
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:37,665
In a few moments
you'll be filming your droop commercials

435
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,900
with the help of Bob Harper.

436
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,869
And tomorrow on the main stage,

437
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,406
we'll be joined by
our extra special guest judge,

438
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:47,374
the legendary

439
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,843
Chaka Khan.

440
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:52,780
-[screaming]
-Oh, my God.

441
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:54,615
Chaka Khan.
[screams]

442
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:56,750
My heart is beating so fast.

443
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,319
I'm, like, salivating over here.

444
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:01,422
All right, good luck and don't fuck it up.

445
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:02,490
-Come on, Bob.
-Bye, guys.

446
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,025
[Widow] Chaka Khan.

447
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,393
What?

448
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,796
My commercial, without a doubt,

449
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:11,398
has to be funny as shit.

450
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,768
I'm not going down in front of Chaka Khan.

451
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:16,370
I am gagging.

452
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,407
-Hi, Jackie Cox.
-[Jackie] Hello.

453
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,709
Let's do this.

454
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:25,579
It's time for me to film my green screen
commercial with Bob Harper.

455
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm ready for this.

456
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,315
All right, so we have 20 minutes.

457
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:31,919
You can use the pit crew, you can use
any of the furniture provided by Objects.

458
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,487
[Jackie] Great. Let's set the scene.

459
00:18:33,554 --> 00:18:35,322
I need this big chair,

460
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:36,957
and then I need my pillows.

461
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:37,925
We only have 20 minutes.

462
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,228
You're dealing with a director
and a lot of cameras.

463
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,030
<i>You have to know exactly what you want</i>

464
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:44,598
and how you want it all to go down.

465
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:47,134
So, you're gonna be
my little harem boy, just fanning me.

466
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:48,035
Oh.

467
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:50,070
That's your character, own that.

468
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm feeling like I'm
in a genie's bottle right now.

469
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:53,541
[Jackie] Exactly.

470
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,175
This is what we're going for here.

471
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,343
Action.

472
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,147
Introducing Magic Carpet Merkins.

473
00:19:01,382 --> 00:19:04,251
And then we'll cut,
and then I need someone to set the merkins

474
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:05,886
while I hold this position.

475
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:08,923
And then they'll appear
when you hit play again.

476
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,791
What's going on, I mean... wh-- what?

477
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,227
Being a fan of 1960s television,

478
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:16,263
I do love the stop, pause and reset

479
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,632
<i>old school TV magic,</i>

480
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,634
<i>but Bob's just kind of confused.</i>

481
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,237
Hard cut. Sound effect. Poof. I'm a genie.

482
00:19:23,304 --> 00:19:24,371
Oh.

483
00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:26,140
I'm hard cutting
like it's the sixties, baby.

484
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,776
You really are, I mean, I get it now.

485
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:32,146
Barbara Eden,
Elizabeth Montgomery, send me help.

486
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,748
Now that we know your vision, my darling,

487
00:19:34,815 --> 00:19:35,783
let's do another take.

488
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:39,587
Introducing Jackie's Magic Carpet Merkins.

489
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:45,593
So, if someone can grab those merkins
and set them on this table.

490
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,595
Bryce.

491
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:48,829
I'll just keep holding.

492
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:50,898
Standing here frozen.

493
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:52,566
Waiting for those merkins.

494
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:54,902
Bryce.

495
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:56,370
Run.

496
00:19:56,437 --> 00:19:58,539
By all means, move at a glacial pace.

497
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:00,441
[Jackie]<i> We are just pausing the camera,</i>

498
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:03,510
moving the things into frame
and restarting the camera.

499
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,912
<i>Just like they did it in the old days.</i>

500
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,081
[Bob chuckles] And action.

501
00:20:08,449 --> 00:20:09,316
[gasps]

502
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:10,751
[laughing]

503
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,286
[Bob] Oh, my God, that's great.

504
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,655
[Bob] Okay, Gigi, we got 20 minutes.

505
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:15,656
What are we gonna do?

506
00:20:15,723 --> 00:20:18,292
Well, my product is called
Goode Night, Bitch.

507
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:20,761
Um, it's a fragrance that doubles as

508
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:23,464
-a highly potent sleeping aid.
-[Bob] Okay.

509
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:24,698
Knock me out.

510
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,569
Introducing Ru Co-lab's
newest fragrance and sleeping aid,

511
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:30,004
Goode Night, Bitch.

512
00:20:31,138 --> 00:20:32,006
And cut.

513
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:33,841
Good?

514
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,844
Um, I'd like to do one more time.

515
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,912
Give me something different
with Goode Night, Bitch, okay?

516
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:42,616
I mean, make Goode Night, Bitch
sound just even more important.

517
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:43,884
Okay.

518
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,988
Introducing Ru Co-lab's
newest fragrance and sleeping aid,

519
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:49,356
Goode Night, Bitch.

520
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,426
I feel like it's working,
Gigi, I feel sleepy.

521
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,695
-Oh.
-I mean, you're very statuesque.

522
00:20:54,762 --> 00:20:56,430
I just need the statue to move a bit.

523
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:58,799
-Hi, Bob.
-How are you, honey?

524
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,568
Baby, I'm good,
ready to shoot this commercial.

525
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,803
-Yeah?
-This is gonna be a winning one.

526
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,371
-It is?
-For sure, it's fun.

527
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:06,006
[Jan] Here we go.

528
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:09,143
Hey, girl, it's the high-energy,

529
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:12,112
high-belting bitch from season 12.

530
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,782
Wow, Jan-tastic.

531
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:16,417
Wow.

532
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,152
All right, just know this.

533
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:20,120
You're coming off very intense right now

534
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,789
-Okay.
-[Bob] So, it's, like, I want

535
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:23,757
a couple of different levels, all right?

536
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,159
-You got it.
-Take a breath.

537
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:26,794
-You got it.
-Action.

538
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,062
Hey, everyone.

539
00:21:28,128 --> 00:21:30,431
Introducing the all-enhancing spray

540
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,333
to make your simple life Jan-tastic.

541
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,335
Breathe, Jan. Breathe, honey.

542
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:36,904
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

543
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:38,405
[Bob] Next scene, what do we got?

544
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:40,474
[Jan] When I say "one," throw it on me

545
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,442
and then on three I'll drop

546
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,944
so that it looks
like it's raining as I'm going down.

547
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,013
Oh, God. Are you really gonna drop?

548
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,881
Oh, yeah, girl. We getting down there.

549
00:21:47,948 --> 00:21:48,782
[screaming silently]

550
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:49,750
[Bob] Be careful.

551
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:50,684
Let's do it.

552
00:21:50,751 --> 00:21:51,618
[whimsical music playing]

553
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:52,853
[thuds]

554
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,788
Oh. My head hurts.

555
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,392
I am truly throwing
everything but the kitchen sink

556
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,461
at Bob to show him my personality.

557
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,196
-Are you okay?
-I'm great.

558
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,831
-Wait, how many fingers?
-[chuckles] Two.

559
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:05,666
[laughing]

560
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,302
[Bob] And action.

561
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:11,105
Oh, hey, bitch. It's Jaida Essence Hall.

562
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,406
Now I know what you're thinking,

563
00:22:12,473 --> 00:22:14,108
[muffled] damn, she's snatched.

564
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:15,776
And you're right, I am.

565
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:17,077
Wait, wait, wait, hold on one second.

566
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:18,445
Wait, you hit your mic,

567
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:21,448
-don't-- don't hit your chest.
-Oh, shit. Okay, got you. Thank you.

568
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,983
Now I know what you're thinking,

569
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,318
damn, she's snatched.

570
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,219
And you're right.

571
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:26,153
[muffled] I am.

572
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,554
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

573
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,523
I'm sorry.

574
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,058
I know what you're thinking,

575
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:32,392
[muffled] damn, she's snatched.

576
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:33,360
Don't hit your mic.

577
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,996
-Oh, I keep--
-Yeah, I know, I know.

578
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,432
It's like Celine Dion, honey,
I get it. I wanna do it, too.

579
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,134
Now I know what you're thinking,

580
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,869
damn, she looks snatched.

581
00:22:41,935 --> 00:22:43,170
And you're right, I am.

582
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,304
Beautiful.

583
00:22:44,371 --> 00:22:45,272
Moving on.

584
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:49,176
The artist formerly known
as Heidi N Closet.

585
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,511
Yes.

586
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,713
Now, are you gonna be using any of
the furniture, any of these things--

587
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,948
[Heidi] Yes, I need the pedestal
here for my lotion.

588
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:55,949
Where's the lotion?

589
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,151
The lotion.

590
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:58,819
She puts the lotion in the basket.

591
00:22:58,886 --> 00:23:00,354
She puts the lotion in the basket.

592
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,089
[Heidi] ...on the skin,
or else she gets the hose again.

593
00:23:02,156 --> 00:23:03,891
[laughing]

594
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,927
So let's get
all the narration first, okay?

595
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:08,428
-Okay, yes.
-Action.

596
00:23:08,495 --> 00:23:11,031
Are you tired of your skin being...

597
00:23:11,732 --> 00:23:12,599
Ooh.

598
00:23:12,866 --> 00:23:13,734
Take two.

599
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:18,238
Are you tired of your skin
being thirsty and dry?

600
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:22,442
Are you tired of not having
a so much of a tight downstairs?

601
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,378
-Cut. Big, honey, big and funny.
-Okay.

602
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,279
[Bob] Sell it.

603
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,447
Sell it, Heidi, just like on the corner.

604
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,551
[Bob] Heidi is so funny.

605
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:34,354
But she's making me laugh...
in between takes.

606
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:38,859
As soon as you stop delivering your lines,
you are cracking me up.

607
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:42,029
Give me more of what you're giving
when the camera turns off...

608
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:43,630
-Okay.
-...on camera.

609
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:45,499
-You got that?
-Yes.

610
00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:47,734
Forget about everything,
just let loose, Heidi. Go, girl.

611
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:52,673
Now introducing
Heidi's Hydrates Multipurpose Lotion.

612
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:53,607
Yes.

613
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:56,210
Made from tears of a drag queen.

614
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,612
[exaggerated sobbing]

615
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,416
Just go, get in there. Oh, God.

616
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,285
[Heidi]<i> Mama gots a lot of personality</i>

617
00:24:05,352 --> 00:24:08,088
and if that's what they want on camera,
that's what I'm gonna give 'em.

618
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,056
[screaming]

619
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:12,226
[shudders]
The girls look okay?

620
00:24:14,228 --> 00:24:15,462
My Tyra Banks.

621
00:24:16,263 --> 00:24:18,065
Get in there, I gotta make money.

622
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,968
I got 30 cents in my bank account.

623
00:24:21,034 --> 00:24:22,169
[screaming]

624
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,375
[Heidi] Oh, she's a actress.

625
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:30,244
She really is, right there.

626
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,579
[Bob] Widow Von'Du, ThroatÉ.

627
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:35,816
.Sounds like it could be
really fun and super exciting

628
00:24:35,883 --> 00:24:37,584
It's gonna be all about your delivery.

629
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:38,619
All right, action.

630
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,320
I am Widow Von'Du.

631
00:24:40,754 --> 00:24:41,755
Humanitarian.

632
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:44,825
Oh, fuck, I forgot
the first couple of lines.

633
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,793
Cut, let's start again.

634
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:48,829
[Widow]<i> I'm a little nervous</i>

635
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,832
and so I'm a little demure
for the first take

636
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,935
'cause I'm trying to just
remember the shit that I wrote.

637
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:57,170
Relax and action.

638
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,473
ThroatÉ is GMO-free...

639
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:01,375
cruelty-free...

640
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,145
Ooh, forgot the next line.
[chuckles]

641
00:25:05,946 --> 00:25:08,649
Oh, my Jesus.

642
00:25:09,182 --> 00:25:10,183
I'm nervous as shit.

643
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:11,785
Just sell it for me.

644
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:12,953
[clears throat]

645
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,989
[Widow]<i> I want to remember
everything I wrote,</i>

646
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:20,060
but Ru's words are sitting
right on my frontal lobe.

647
00:25:20,127 --> 00:25:21,461
ThroatÉ...

648
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,531
Fuck. Can't remember.

649
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,434
[Bob] So, let me just remind you

650
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,871
that your droop ad needs to be memorable,

651
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:32,606
impactful,

652
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,842
and it needs to reflect your brands.

653
00:25:39,046 --> 00:25:42,716
-I love what you have on, by the way.
-Thank you, me too.

654
00:25:42,783 --> 00:25:44,217
All right, let's start. Wow me.

655
00:25:46,053 --> 00:25:47,821
Unh, unh. Oh, yeah.

656
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,389
The magic mullet!

657
00:25:52,392 --> 00:25:54,227
Okay, perfect, um...

658
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:55,562
Wait, what's happening?

659
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:58,332
Well, I wanna start and then
kind of cut to the B-roll

660
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:00,167
'cause I don't really
have anything to fill.

661
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,935
-[Bob] Okay.
-In my vision.

662
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,770
-Okay, honey.
-[Crystal] Now.

663
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:05,672
I worked with a team of scientists

664
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:09,076
to create a product that will turn you
into a fierce bitch like me

665
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:10,410
in a matter of seconds.

666
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:13,747
Um, I need just a table
that we can do science on.

667
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:14,781
[laughing]

668
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:16,750
[Bob] Is that a science table, Crystal?

669
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:18,185
Oh, hot.

670
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:20,087
[Crystal] Hurry.

671
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:22,222
I am running around
like a chicken with its head cut off.

672
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:23,924
[hammer banging]

673
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:25,258
Hmm...

674
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:28,228
I've gotta scramble
and get all these shots filmed

675
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,998
because if I don't,
this commercial is gonna make no sense.

676
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:33,800
We got seven minutes left,
we gotta power through it.

677
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:36,570
Wow, Crystal, you're so
gorgeous and confident.

678
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,940
Try to be a little different,
you're still giving me Crystal, okay?

679
00:26:40,007 --> 00:26:42,309
[in a deep voice] Wha-- Wow, Crystal.

680
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,877
[laughing] I like it.

681
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:45,679
Wow, Crystal,

682
00:26:45,746 --> 00:26:50,083
I wish I could be
as gorgeous and confident as you.

683
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,785
[laughing] Sounds like Cher.

684
00:26:51,852 --> 00:26:53,420
I think that was it?

685
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,256
I don't really exactly know what that was.

686
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,824
[Crystal]<i> At the end of my shoot,</i>

687
00:26:57,891 --> 00:27:00,060
I'm pretty sure that I got
all the shots that I need,

688
00:27:00,127 --> 00:27:01,661
<i>but who knows?</i>

689
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,198
If not, this commercial
is not gonna make any sense.

690
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:07,634
[upbeat music playing]

691
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:08,668
[Jan] Here we go!

692
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:11,538
It's my wedding day, I'm getting married.

693
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:12,606
[Heidi] It's another day, honey.

694
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,108
[vocalizing to "Wedding March"]

695
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,578
So, today is elimination day
and somebody has to take their ass home.

696
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:20,580
[Sherry] It's our wedding day.

697
00:27:20,647 --> 00:27:22,716

698
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,619
[Crystal]<i> Today's
runway theme is Black Wedding.</i>

699
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,254
I'm really excited for this runway,

700
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,389
I know that the other queens have got...

701
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:30,323
<i>very...</i>

702
00:27:30,824 --> 00:27:33,226
<i>expensive gowns,</i>

703
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:35,262
and my take is a little bit different

704
00:27:35,328 --> 00:27:37,164
<i>and I'm hoping that it pays off.</i>

705
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:39,933
[upbeat music playing]

706
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,435
[Jackie] Jan, how are you doing?

707
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:42,436
I'm good.

708
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:47,074
I feel like last week, obviously,
was a very emotional week for me.

709
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,009
And I also wanna say, like, I...

710
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:53,346
was just upset about Brita leaving

711
00:27:53,413 --> 00:27:56,049
because I have
such a high respect for her.

712
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,485
[Jan]<i> I don't want people to think that</i>

713
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:01,855
I'm upset that I didn't win.

714
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:05,358
Because I'm genuinely upset the most

715
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,060
about Brita leaving.

716
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:08,795
<i>I've known Brita for years.</i>

717
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:11,298
<i>I've looked up to her since the first day</i>

718
00:28:11,364 --> 00:28:13,467
that I started doing drag
in New York City.

719
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,936
<i>We competed against each other,</i>

720
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:19,773
<i>and from that day, she's always been
such a cheerleader for me.</i>

721
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,609
I know that other girls don't have
the same relationship that we do

722
00:28:22,676 --> 00:28:25,212
which is why I'm so emotional about it.

723
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:30,083
Because I know the tremendous amount
of pressure and stress

724
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,819
and effort that she puts into her drag.

725
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:36,823
I'm not denying that I wasn't, like,
not thrilled that I didn't win.

726
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:40,160
It just makes me wanna
work harder and show the judges

727
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:42,896
that I'm not just somebody
who's gonna do well in a musical,

728
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:46,766
I can do well in different
elements of this competition.

729
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,269
And I think I did that this week.

730
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:53,406
When Jan's frustrated
and in her head about things,

731
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,142
[high-pitched] she jumps
into this little voice

732
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,711
and you can tell that all of a sudden,
things aren't going well.

733
00:28:57,911 --> 00:29:00,247
[normal voice] I think this competition
has shaken her.

734
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:07,487
I'm so happy
y'all are my season 12 sisters.

735
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,789
[Sherry] Talking about sisters,

736
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:13,693
anybody think that they can do
a good impression of one of your sisters?

737
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:16,663

Are you feeling the<i> jantasy</i>?

We're doing impre-- Do you have any
impressions of any of the cast members?

748

[imitating Crystal] Oh, I don't really
have any impressions of anyone,

Kind of, sort of, I can see it.

866
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:16,262
[Widow]<i> I am wearing this sequinned gown</i>

867
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:19,499
<i>with this beautiful giant train,</i>

868
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:22,569
<i>and then when I take off
that mask, boom, bitch.</i>

869
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:23,770
<i>Look at in my eyes.</i>

870
00:34:23,837 --> 00:34:25,371
<i>She ain't got no soul</i>

871
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:26,873
[Michelle] Peek-a-Ru.

872
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,476
[Ross] She's registered
at Bed Black & Beyond.

873
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,010
[laughing]

874
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,012
[RuPaul] Crystal Methyd.

875
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,981
[Ross] She's dying to get married.

876
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:36,716
[Chaka Khan] Oh, Lord, have mercy, yes.

877
00:34:36,983 --> 00:34:38,785
[Crystal]<i> I am serving an undead bride</i>

878
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:42,388
<i>who just dug her way
out of her grave to find her love.</i>

879
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,123
<i>I am loving my character.</i>

880
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,392
<i>My gloves are even
ripped at the fingertips</i>

881
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,528
<i>because when you die,
your nails keep growing.</i>

882
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,530
<i>I am covered in dust.</i>

883
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:52,532
<i>I think I look drop dead gorgeous</i>

884
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,401
-[Ross] Um, there's a shampoo for that.
-[laughing]

885
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,669
[Michelle] Death becomes her.

886
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:58,238
[laughing]

887
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,941
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

888
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:04,511
It is time for the judges' critiques.

889
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:08,014
First up, Jackie Cox.

890
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:10,416
Let's take a look
at your droop commercial.

891
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,887
[Jackie]<i> When you're out
at the discotheque,</i>

892
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:15,889
<i>Does your snatch game got you down?</i>

893
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:18,424
<i>Is your hoo-hoo looking more ho-hum?</i>

894
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,759
[laughing]

895
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,594
Well, Jackie Cox has the solution.

896
00:35:22,028 --> 00:35:23,029
For you!

897
00:35:23,096 --> 00:35:26,866
Introducing Jackie's Magic Carpet Merkins.

898
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,103
What is this merkin, you ask?

899
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,671
Jackie Cox has the answers.

900
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:32,972
For you!

901
00:35:33,206 --> 00:35:36,276
A merkin is a wig
for your very own cave of wonders

902
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,545
originally worn by ladies of the night.

903
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,346
Hookers.

904
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,084
<i>Jackie's Magic Carpet Merkins
will spruce up any queen's look.</i>

905
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:48,354
<i>Plus, that special man
in your life can wear it, too.</i>

906
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:49,489
<i>Not there.</i>

907
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:51,124
<i>There.</i>

908
00:35:51,624 --> 00:35:54,827
Jackie's Magic Carpet Merkins
are a wish come true.

909
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,063
For you!

910
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,298
<i>The carpets may not match the drapes.</i>

911
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,667
<i>Droop is not responsible
for any rashes, hives, or gout</i>

912
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:02,335
<i>that may occur from using
magic carpet merkins.</i>

913
00:36:02,402 --> 00:36:03,970
<i>Jackie Cox is not a genie.</i>

914
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,305
<i>But don't tell her that.</i>

915
00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:06,706
[laughing]

916
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,509
[RuPaul] All right, Jackie,
let's go to the judges.

917
00:36:09,943 --> 00:36:12,045
Well, for starters,
I think you look really beautiful.

918
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:14,380
I get who this woman is right away

919
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:16,683
and I love that you were
telling a story on the runway, too.

920
00:36:16,749 --> 00:36:20,053
I actually
really enjoyed your infomercial.

921
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:23,089
You had elements of the old school
in there with the, "For you!"

922
00:36:23,256 --> 00:36:25,291
And some really funny jokes that landed.

923
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:27,093
Your whole infomercial was thought out,

924
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,561
from the way you wrote it,

925
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:30,730
to knowing that you were gonna
turn to the camera

926
00:36:30,797 --> 00:36:32,765
and have that be a gimmick. Well done.

927
00:36:32,832 --> 00:36:34,133
I think you did a great job.

928
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:36,235
Did she make you wanna buy a merkin?

929
00:36:36,703 --> 00:36:37,737
What is a merkin?

930
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:39,572
[Michelle] The vagina wig.

931
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:45,778
That's the best stuff
I've learned this year.

932
00:36:45,845 --> 00:36:47,246
[laughing]

933
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:48,881
She's living the merkin dream.

934
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:50,083
That's right.

935
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,585
-Thanks, Jackie.
-Thank you, RuPaul.

936
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,621
Up next, Jan.

937
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:56,489
Simply Jan.

938
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,191
Hey, everyone!

939
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:00,960
it's the high-energy, high-belting

940
00:37:01,027 --> 00:37:04,497
highly positive bitch from season 12, Jan.

941
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,332
Simply Jan.

942
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:08,468
Have you ever wanted to...

943
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:10,169
[moans]

944
00:37:10,536 --> 00:37:12,438
feel the Jan-tasy?

945
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,774
Well, girl, now you can.

946
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,809
Introducing Sure, Jan,

947
00:37:16,876 --> 00:37:20,213
the all-enhancing spray
that will make your simple life

948
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,681
Jan-tastic!

949
00:37:21,748 --> 00:37:25,284
<i>Tired of being the boring ugly sister
that can't get a buck?</i>

950
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,753
<i>Ooh.</i>

951
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:27,854
<i>Sure, Jan.</i>

952
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,489
<i>Jantastic.</i>

953
00:37:29,822 --> 00:37:31,824
<i>Tired of sounding like
a fucked up car motor?</i>

954
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:33,860
[screeching]

955
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:34,761
[glass breaking]

956
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:36,863
<i>Sure, Jan.</i>

957
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,898
[vocalizing]

958
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,400
<i>Jan-tastic.</i>

959
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:44,137
<i>Tired of sitting at home complaining
instead of doing something about it?</i>

960
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:45,471
<i>Sure, Jan.</i>

961
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,774
<i>Jantastic!</i>

962
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,077
You can get Sure, Jan for $69.

963
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,979
<i>So, what are you waiting for?</i>

964
00:37:53,046 --> 00:37:55,682
<i>Feel the jantasy with Sure, Jan.</i>

965
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,519
Jan, you look
so gorgeous tonight.

966
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:01,020
You look beautiful.

967
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:02,855
Thank you so much.

968
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:04,490
I love everything about this.

969
00:38:04,557 --> 00:38:06,125
I would wear that to my wedding.

970
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:07,827
With your infomercial,

971
00:38:07,894 --> 00:38:11,764
between making you feel better
and then doing death drops,

972
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,399
then you're gonna be a better singer.

973
00:38:13,466 --> 00:38:15,702
I think you tried to fit so much in

974
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,537
that it became convoluted.

975
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,338
Okay.

976
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:20,940
I loved the puns in your video.

977
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,141
-Thank you.
-[Ross] Everything with Jan.

978
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,910
But you had so much energy

979
00:38:23,976 --> 00:38:25,611
that it started at a hundred

980
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,547
and stayed there the whole time.

981
00:38:27,747 --> 00:38:29,248
We need peaks and valleys

982
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:31,984
'cause we don't know where to go,
where to follow you, we get exhausted.

983
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:32,885
Right.

984
00:38:32,952 --> 00:38:34,520
It was a little [trilling].

985
00:38:36,422 --> 00:38:38,991
Up next, Jaida Essence Hall.

986
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,861
Oh, hey, bitch.

987
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:43,262
It's Jaida Essence Hall,

988
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:45,498
terrible actress from<i> Gay's Anatomy</i>

989
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:47,667
and world famous rich drag queen.

990
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,502
Now, I know what you're thinking

991
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:50,937
damn, she looks snatched.

992
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:51,938
And you're right.

993
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,273
But why the hell am I really here?

994
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,242
<i>Crotch got you down?</i>

995
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:57,777
<i>Lumpy, bumpy tuck?</i>

996
00:38:58,311 --> 00:39:00,213
<i>Sticky mess and bubblegum crotch?</i>

997
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:01,114
<i>Ouch!</i>

998
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,349
Then you need the Luxuratuck.

999
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:06,085
At a modest $5,000 per pair,

1000
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:09,055
these panties are sourced
from the silk of rare tarantulas

1001
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:11,124
<i>found in the Glamazonian rainforest.</i>

1002
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,392
<i>And made for strength, stretch, luxury,</i>

1003
00:39:13,459 --> 00:39:15,862
<i>and pulling back those little lady bits.</i>

1004
00:39:15,995 --> 00:39:17,196
Anaconda?

1005
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:19,165
I don't even know her!

1006
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:20,366
[laughing]

1007
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:23,836
<i>Each Luxuratuck is crafted with
a diamond encrusted monogram</i>

1008
00:39:24,036 --> 00:39:27,306
<i>and offer anyone who wants to
let the world know that you are indeed...</i>

1009
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:28,341
<i>that bitch.</i>

1010
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:29,642
Get snatched.

1011
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:31,944
From the front all the way to the back

1012
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,379
with the Luxuratuck.

1013
00:39:33,813 --> 00:39:35,548
[laughing]

1014
00:39:36,182 --> 00:39:37,416
I love this look.

1015
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:38,417
Thank you.

1016
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:39,819
[Ross] Because it's so gorgeous,

1017
00:39:39,886 --> 00:39:41,587
I mean, any girl would want this dress,

1018
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:43,456
and any man...
[laughing]

1019
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,624
would want this dress, too.

1020
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,326
You were so good in your infomercial.

1021
00:39:47,393 --> 00:39:49,462
Because right out of the gate
you made a joke

1022
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:51,230
that let us know it was okay to laugh.

1023
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:53,299
<i>Terrible actress from </i>Gay's Anatomy<i>.</i>

1024
00:39:53,366 --> 00:39:55,134
I think you're so freaking funny,

1025
00:39:55,201 --> 00:39:56,402
bitch.

1026
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,471
[laughing]

1027
00:39:58,538 --> 00:39:59,705
And it's so funny.

1028
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,675
You hit the jokes
where they needed to be,

1029
00:40:02,742 --> 00:40:05,611
so we actually had time to laugh
and continue to listen.

1030
00:40:05,678 --> 00:40:09,015
You are actually selling a real product
that I would probably buy.

1031
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,149
Well you need one.

1032
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:11,384
[Michelle] I do.

1033
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,085
[laughing]

1034
00:40:13,152 --> 00:40:15,421
Up next, Gigi Goode.

1035
00:40:16,389 --> 00:40:17,256
Hi.

1036
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,491
I'm better than you.

1037
00:40:18,558 --> 00:40:20,426
And in the rare case
you're anything like me,

1038
00:40:20,493 --> 00:40:22,562
you find it hard to get
a good night's sleep

1039
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,297
after a long day of competing

1040
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:26,866
for the title of
America's next drag superstar.

1041

<i>horse tranquilizer,</i>

1045
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,010
<i>and pine.</i>

1046

1047

[quietly]<i> Possibly for days.</i>

1049
00:40:45,418 --> 00:40:48,187
For just $18,500,

1050
00:40:48,254 --> 00:40:49,956
or roughly the prize money

1051
00:40:50,022 --> 00:40:52,992
for three maxi challenges
and two mini challenges,

1052
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,695
you'll finally wake up
feeling fully rested

1053
00:40:55,761 --> 00:40:57,563
and only slightly constipated.

1054
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,532
<i>Don't just wait to fall asleep.</i>

1055
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,267
Get knocked the fuck out.

1056
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,002
Goode Night, Bitch.

1057
00:41:04,604 --> 00:41:06,105
[snoring]

1058
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,575
Tonight on the runway. My God.

1059
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:12,211
Oof. Stunning.

1060
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:14,480
You really
do look like a picture.

1061
00:41:14,814 --> 00:41:15,915
Picture perfect.

1062
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:17,884
[Ross] Your infomercial

1063
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,919
just felt a little clunky.

1064
00:41:20,887 --> 00:41:22,388
And it's like you couldn't
get your rhythm in it.

1065
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:24,257
<i>Goode Night, Bitch.</i>

1066
00:41:24,323 --> 00:41:26,058
And that's where some
of the jokes were lost.

1067
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:29,028
Like, even when you were
listing the ingredients, right?

1068
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:31,163
You wanna end on the funny one.

1069
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,231
Okay.

1070
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:35,034
There's pine, this and horse tranquilizer.

1071
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:37,270
O-ho-ho, that's when we laugh.

1072
00:41:37,336 --> 00:41:38,371
Meh...

1073
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,306
on the video.

1074
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:45,945
Up next, I hope y'all saved room
for some Sherry Pie.

1075
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:49,849
[Sherry]<i> Nothing better to do
than count your money?</i>

1076
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:52,418
I just have so much money.

1077
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:54,120
I'm Sherry Pie,

1078
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:56,589
and if you're tired
of counting your money,

1079
00:41:56,656 --> 00:41:59,191
then boy, oh, boy,

1080
00:41:59,258 --> 00:42:01,627
I have something that you can spend it on.

1081
00:42:01,694 --> 00:42:04,163
Sherry Pie's Aura Pie.

1082
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,600
<i>Sherry Pie's Aura Pie is all-natural</i>

1083
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:10,169
<i>guaranteeing to turn any aura</i>

1084
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,738
<i>from drab to fab!</i>

1085
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:14,941
<i>I know what you're thinking...</i>

1086
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:16,309
<i>Does this work?</i>

1087
00:42:16,876 --> 00:42:18,511
<i>What is an aura?</i>

1088
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:21,914
<i>How did you become so good looking?</i>

1089
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:24,951
I don't know the answer
to any of those questions,

1090
00:42:25,017 --> 00:42:26,986
but I do know how much it costs.

1091
00:42:27,053 --> 00:42:30,323
$350 a slice.

1092
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:32,992
The newest, hottest treat

1093
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:35,494
for the financially elite.

1094
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,330
Get yours now!

1095
00:42:39,732 --> 00:42:41,100
[RuPaul] All right,
let's go to the judges.

1096
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,736
You're performing
with such ease in the infomercial,

1097
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:46,305
but then I realize
we're about a half way through

1098
00:42:46,372 --> 00:42:47,606
before we get a joke.

1099
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:49,408
-Yeah.
-[Ross] Right?

1100
00:42:49,475 --> 00:42:50,476
I don't know, it's like a race horse,

1101
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:52,578
you just sort of trotted
the first half of the race.

1102
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:54,013
Not gonna win that way.

1103
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,150
I just wanted more from you,
especially in this challenge.

1104
00:42:58,217 --> 00:42:59,485
Tonight on the runway, however,

1105
00:42:59,552 --> 00:43:02,788
you gave us all of the extra more
that we were looking for.

1106
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:05,057
-It was all very beautiful.
-Thank you.

1107
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,826
Up next, Heidi.

1108
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,564
Are you tired of your skin
being thirsty and dry?

1109
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,699
Are you tired of having a not-so-tight...

1110
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:15,468
downstairs?

1111
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:19,505
Now introducing
Heidi's Hydrates Multipurpose Lotion

1112
00:43:19,572 --> 00:43:23,376
made from
[whistling] silks and satins,

1113
00:43:23,442 --> 00:43:26,112
as well as tears of a drag queen.

1114
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:27,213
Mine!

1116
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,850
Oh, God.

1117
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:33,185
Get in there.

1118
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,656
Uses range from frying chicken

1119
00:43:37,723 --> 00:43:38,958
to waxing a car

1120
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:41,193
and vaginal rejuvenation.

1121
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,528
[gasps]

1122
00:43:43,629 --> 00:43:44,663
Thank you.

1123
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,899
All this can be yours

1124
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:49,568
for $699

1125
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:51,570
[whispering] and 96 cents.

1126
00:43:52,571 --> 00:43:54,607
<i>Heidi's Hydrates may cause hair loss,</i>

1127
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,108
[yelling]
mood swings

1128
00:43:56,575 --> 00:43:57,910
and uncontrollable flatulence.

1129
00:43:57,977 --> 00:43:59,945
-[farts]
-Ooh. Excuse me.

1130
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,347
Heidi's Hydrates.

1131
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,650
Bitch, I told you
it could cause hair loss.

1132
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,452
[laughing]

1133
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,990
Tonight on the runway,
I think this is a beautiful gown on you.

1134
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:12,024
Thank you.

1135
00:44:12,091 --> 00:44:14,060
Let me tell you, that dress is cut

1136
00:44:14,126 --> 00:44:17,063
within an inch of all of our lives.

1137
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,633
I mean, that's the cut for every woman.

1138
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:25,371
You have this ability to show your heart.

1139
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:27,306
Then we watch your video,

1140
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:29,075
and you're hilarious, too?

1141
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:33,512
It's just so fun to see
somebody who I instantly love

1142
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,582
have all the goods to back it up.

1143
00:44:36,649 --> 00:44:38,084
The tear thing was hilarious,

1144
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,486
<i>the whistling through the teeth
when you were speaking.</i>

1145
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:43,222
It was so funny and so much fun to watch.

1146
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:44,957
-So, Heidi.
-Yes?

1147
00:44:45,024 --> 00:44:46,792
First of all, you know
I'm gonna sue your black ass?

1148
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,861
-Oh, boy, here we go.
-[laughing]

1149
00:44:48,928 --> 00:44:52,131
Lo and behold, this bitch
just done stole my idea.

1150
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:54,867
That's a mark against you,
but at the same time,

1151
00:44:54,934 --> 00:44:57,369
it's a mark for you
because you are listening.

1152
00:44:57,837 --> 00:44:59,572
You did really good, very funny.

1153
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:01,373
But just keep this in mind,

1154
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,777
I now own 51 per cent of Heidi's Hydrates.

1155
00:45:04,844 --> 00:45:06,445
[laughing]

1156
00:45:06,979 --> 00:45:10,416
[RuPaul] Up next, the Widow Von'Du.

1157
00:45:10,483 --> 00:45:11,717
All right.

1158
00:45:11,884 --> 00:45:12,751
Hello.

1159
00:45:13,052 --> 00:45:15,054
I am Widow Von'Du.

1160
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,622
Humanitarian,

1161
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:18,157
philanthropist,

1162
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,592
organ donor.

1163
00:45:20,059 --> 00:45:22,027
Are you wanting to be a Broadway actress?

1164
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,295
Maybe a singer?

1165
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:26,999
Maybe you want to do some
extracurricular activities this weekend?

1166
00:45:27,466 --> 00:45:29,034
Wink, wink.

1167
00:45:29,468 --> 00:45:31,103
Well, have I got good news for you.

1168
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,705
I introduce to you

1169
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,808
my revolutionary
throat-coating spray ThroatÉ.

1170
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:36,909
'Cause, bitch,

1171
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:38,511
you're gagging.

1172
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:42,381
<i>Every bottle has a non-lethal dosage
of black widow venom</i>

1173
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,417
<i>just to give you
that extra little tingling sensation</i>

1174
00:45:45,484 --> 00:45:47,086
<i>deep inside.</i>

1175
00:45:47,153 --> 00:45:49,155
ThroatÉ has so many different uses.

1176
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:50,723
<i>Mace.</i>

1177
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:51,624
[coughing]

1178
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:53,125
<i>Setting spray,</i>

1179
00:45:53,192 --> 00:45:54,727
<i>or even cleaning the kitchen.</i>

1180
00:45:57,663 --> 00:46:00,032
<i>You can coat your ThroatÉ today.</i>

1181
00:46:00,933 --> 00:46:02,701
'Cause you're gagging, bitches.

1182
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:06,505
[Michelle] Tonight on the runway,
it was gorgeous.

1183
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:08,240
I love the veil with the crystals.

1184
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,843
That's hot.
I think that's really effective.

1185
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:11,744
[Michelle] Mm-hmm.

1186
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,146
In the infomercial, I felt like
you were just kind of sitting there

1187
00:46:14,213 --> 00:46:15,714
and matter-of-factly just saying things.

1188
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,218
I needed a whole lot more funny.

1189
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:21,921
I don't know what happened.

1190
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,088
You see what I'm seeing, though, right?

1191
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:23,989
Yes.

1192
00:46:24,056 --> 00:46:27,092
What was missing from the infomercial

1193
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,360
was the joy.

1194
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:31,397
Why do you think that happened?

1195
00:46:34,066 --> 00:46:37,036
I don't know, I-- I really don't know.

1196
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:38,837
[sobbing]

1197
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:41,207
It just seems like
something is crushing me

1198
00:46:41,273 --> 00:46:42,908
and I don't know what it is, and it just--

1199
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:45,878
It's keeping me from doing better.
I don't-- I don't know.

1200
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:49,448
This is
where it gets really, really tough.

1201
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:53,786
This is where all of the self-doubt
and saboteur pops up

1202
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,423
and tries to derail your path.

1203
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:59,858
I really want to do well in front of

1204
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:02,328
the judges, and especially
in front of Chaka Khan,

1205
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:03,262
I waited...

1206
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:06,966
forever to finally be
in the presence of you, and I'm--

1207
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,035
-Oh, bless you.
-I wanted this, I wanted this so bad.

1208
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,972
It's a bad review.

1209
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,174
Don't take it too deeply to your heart.

1210
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:17,843
This could be a turning point
for you, you know that?

1211
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,812
I see great promise in you.

1212
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,748
Hear what she's saying to you, Widow.

1213
00:47:23,082 --> 00:47:24,383
Hear it. And own it.

1214
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,851
Really, 'cause this is important.

1215
00:47:25,918 --> 00:47:26,819
Thank you.

1216
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,391
Up next, Crystal Methyd.

1217
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,325
Boo!

1218
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,593
[laughing]

1219
00:47:36,095 --> 00:47:39,398
Oh, hey, it's me,
Crystal Methyd, drag legend.

1220
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:41,867
You know, people are always telling me...

1221
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:43,736
Wow, Crystal,

1222
00:47:43,802 --> 00:47:48,040
I wish I could be
as gorgeous and confident as you.

1223
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:51,910
Well, I've been working on a project
with a few scientists

1224
00:47:51,977 --> 00:47:54,246
<i>that will turn you
into a fierce bitch like me</i>

1225
00:47:54,313 --> 00:47:55,514
in a matter of seconds.

1226
00:47:55,981 --> 00:47:57,249
<i>The Magic Mullet!</i>

1227
00:47:57,516 --> 00:47:59,251
<i>Made from a unique blend of hair</i>

1228
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:02,321
<i>collected from the tails
of squirrels and raccoons.</i>

1229
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:06,125
<i>Each headband is infused
with our advanced droop technology,</i>

1230
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:08,193
<i>which releases hormones into the brain</i>

1231
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,562
<i>to increase strength and sex drive.</i>

1232
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,767
<i>The Magic Mullet is
super absorbent and dishwasher safe,</i>

1233
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,669
making it perfect for working out.

1234
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,704
Don't waste years of your life

1235
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,774
waiting for your hair to grow
long and beautiful like mine

1236
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,642
because you could die at any minute.

1237
00:48:23,709 --> 00:48:25,878
What are you waiting for?

1238
00:48:26,345 --> 00:48:28,881
Wow, thanks Magic Mullet.

1239
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:32,551
<i>The Magic Mullet. Get the party started.</i>

1240
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:34,887
[laughing]

1241
00:48:35,888 --> 00:48:37,690
I think this look is to die for.

1242
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:39,124
[laughing]

1243
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:41,827
I'm like
a horror film fanatic.

1244
00:48:41,894 --> 00:48:43,195
It all works, you look great.

1245
00:48:43,262 --> 00:48:44,129
Thank you.

1246
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:45,331
And again, Crystal,

1247
00:48:45,397 --> 00:48:48,167
we get to see a different side
of your make up skills.

1248
00:48:48,867 --> 00:48:51,136
The Magic Mullet was really smart

1249
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:53,305
because you've heard Ru
talk about your mullet

1250
00:48:53,372 --> 00:48:56,942
and you played on something
that you know he's obsessed with.

1251
00:48:57,009 --> 00:48:58,110
And you just sold it.

1252
00:48:58,177 --> 00:48:59,278
[Ross]<i> It was hilarious.</i>

1253
00:48:59,345 --> 00:49:01,447
My favorite shot was
when you were hammering the wig.

1254
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:04,116
[laughing]

1255
00:49:04,183 --> 00:49:07,619
I just really wanted to let you all know
how silly and crazy I am, so.

1256
00:49:08,087 --> 00:49:09,822
-Oh, we know.
-[laughing]

1257
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,957
-Thank you so much, Crystal.
-Thank you.

1258
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:12,958
All right, ladies.

1259
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:14,860
Since we're all together,

1260
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,795
I'm gonna ask each of you...

1261
00:49:18,597 --> 00:49:19,498
Who should go home tonight?

1262
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:22,267
And why?

1263
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:25,404
Let's start with Jackie Cox.

1264
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,706
If one of us has to go home,

1265
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:30,142
I laughed the least at Widow's.

1266
00:49:31,276 --> 00:49:32,811
Jan, who do you think
should go home tonight?

1267
00:49:32,878 --> 00:49:35,080
I would have to say Widow as well.

1268
00:49:36,382 --> 00:49:37,416
All right, Jaida?

1269
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:40,419
I would also have to say Widow.

1270
00:49:40,753 --> 00:49:41,653
[RuPaul] Gigi?

1271
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,089
I agree with my sisters.
I would say Widow.

1272
00:49:44,156 --> 00:49:45,357
[RuPaul] All right, Sherry?

1273
00:49:45,424 --> 00:49:46,558
Widow.

1274
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:48,660
[RuPaul] Heidi? What say you?

1275
00:49:50,095 --> 00:49:50,963
[whispering] Oh, God.

1276
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:52,765
This is hard.

1277
00:49:53,298 --> 00:49:54,199
Say it.

1278
00:49:55,067 --> 00:49:57,169
She's one of my best friends here

1279
00:49:57,236 --> 00:49:59,705
and it's tearing me up to say this,

1280
00:49:59,772 --> 00:50:02,875
this is solely based off the video, Widow.

1281
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:05,177
[RuPaul] All right. So, Widow,

1282
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:07,479
who do you think
should go home tonight and why?

1283
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:15,087
The only other video I saw
that was as bad as mine was Jan's.

1284
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:16,989
[RuPaul] All right, Crystal

1285
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:20,526
I've known Widow
since I started doing drag.

1286
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,262
I didn't see Widow in that video.

1287
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,164
I would have to say Widow.

1288
00:50:26,465 --> 00:50:28,901
Thank you, ladies, for your honesty.

1289
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,937
While you untuck backstage,

1290
00:50:32,004 --> 00:50:33,639
the judges and I will deliberate.

1291
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:35,908
You may leave the stage.

1292
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,145
All right, now,
just between us squirrel friends

1293
00:50:40,212 --> 00:50:41,613
what do you think?

1294
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,015
Let's start with Jackie Cox.

1295
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,517
[Michelle]<i> Jackie Cox's
infomercial was a home run.</i>

1296
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,085
And it was clever, you know.

1297
00:50:47,152 --> 00:50:48,954
But you weren't familiar with the merkin?

1298
00:50:49,321 --> 00:50:51,590
No, I wasn't, and actually
it was an educational video.

1299
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:53,091
[laughing]

1300
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:55,494
[RuPaul]<i> Jan.</i>

1301
00:50:55,561 --> 00:50:58,297
She's like an excited kid
who just wants to please.

1302
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,033
<i>And please she does, she's very talented.</i>

1303
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:03,769
<i>I just think that Jan is gunning too hard</i>

1304
00:51:03,836 --> 00:51:06,138
and it's now coming back to bite her.

1305
00:51:06,205 --> 00:51:08,207
-I just need her to take a breath...
-Mm-hmm.

1306
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,576
...and kind of focus and fine tune.

1307
00:51:11,043 --> 00:51:12,911
[RuPaul]<i> Jaida Essence Hall.</i>

1308
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:14,313
She's hella funny.

1309
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,114
She could be a comedian.

1310
00:51:16,315 --> 00:51:18,383
[Michelle]<i> This girl is
the dark horse of the competition.</i>

1311
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,553
Every single week we see
another layer peeled away

1312
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,789
and we see more and more Jaida.

1313
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,891
[RuPaul]<i> Gigi Goode.</i>

1314
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:29,228
She just... didn't have it
in the infomercial challenge.

1315
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,430
<i>It-- it just didn't work bottom line.</i>

1316
00:51:31,497 --> 00:51:33,332
-Yeah.
-Or top line, I don't know her.

1317
00:51:33,398 --> 00:51:34,833
Yeah.
[laughing]

1318
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:36,235
[RuPaul]<i> Sherry Pie.</i>

1319
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,536
In her infomercial, listen,

1320
00:51:37,603 --> 00:51:40,205
<i>it did not suck, it just
wasn't up to Sherry Pie level.</i>

1321
00:51:40,672 --> 00:51:43,308
I don't think
it was a terrible week for her,

1322
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,011
but there may be some room
for some of these other queens...

1323
00:51:46,078 --> 00:51:48,013
-Yeah.
-To step in front of her in line.

1324
00:51:48,247 --> 00:51:49,147
[RuPaul]<i> Heidi.</i>

1325
00:51:49,214 --> 00:51:50,048
She surprised me

1326
00:51:50,115 --> 00:51:53,285
because I didn't expect
to laugh so hard at her infomercial.

1327
00:51:53,352 --> 00:51:54,386
It was funny.

1328
00:51:54,453 --> 00:51:57,389
[RuPaul]<i> The unexpected twist in rhythm</i>

1329
00:51:57,456 --> 00:51:59,992
that makes something really funny.

1330
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:01,527
She's amazing.

1331
00:52:01,593 --> 00:52:03,161
<i>She's going to go far.</i>

1332
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:05,430
[RuPaul]<i> Widow Von'Du.</i>

1333
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,499
She didn't do the very best commercial.

1334
00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:09,501
Wink, wink.

1335
00:52:09,568 --> 00:52:10,636
It came across as flat.

1336
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:13,305
And we know Widow
to be big and boisterous.

1337
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:14,606
We've seen this before, right?

1338
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,376
When a great queen has a lot of momentum

1339
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:20,145
<i>and maybe they start thinking
about their position in the competition</i>

1340
00:52:20,212 --> 00:52:22,814
and then that gets them
out of actually winning.

1341
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:23,749
Yeah.

1342
00:52:24,049 --> 00:52:25,484
<i>Crystal Methyd.</i>

1343
00:52:25,784 --> 00:52:30,455
Crystal Methyd has done
the biggest 180 in this competition

1344
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:33,458
<i>That infomercial was freaking hilarious.</i>

1345
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,327
She's one of my favorites, of course.

1346
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:36,328
Boo!

1347
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:38,630
So exciting to see
what's happened with Crystal.

1348
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,299
Pay attention to that one.

1349
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,533
She's a threat.

1350
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,801
All right, silence.

1351
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:44,937
I've made my decision.

1352
00:52:45,003 --> 00:52:48,006
Bring back my girls.

1353
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:50,442
Welcome back, ladies.

1354
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:52,611
I've made some decisions.

1355
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,117
Heidi. I loved your performance
so much this week,

1356
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:00,352
I wanna marry it.

1357
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,621
Crystal Methyd.

1358
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:04,623
Your mullets were magic,

1359
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,392
and your zombie gave us life.

1360
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,228
Jaida Essence Hall.

1361
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:11,964
Your anaconda don't,

1362
00:53:13,332 --> 00:53:14,967
but your Luxuratuck do.

1363
00:53:16,301 --> 00:53:17,536
Jackie Cox.

1364
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:20,606
This week, your merkin was workin'.

1365
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,008
Heidi.

1366
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:26,044
Con-drag-ulations, you are
the winner of this week's challenge.

1367
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:28,246
[cheers and applause]

1368
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:31,516
[screaming] Yeah, I win. Oh, bitch.

1369
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,387
Heidi, you've won a cash prize of $5,000.

1370
00:53:35,454 --> 00:53:39,858
Thank you so,
[whistling] so very much.

1371
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,660
[laughing]

1372
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,063
Jaida, Crystal, Jackie,

1373
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,431
you are all safe.

1374
00:53:47,232 --> 00:53:50,035
The four of you may step
to the back of the stage.

1375
00:53:54,673 --> 00:53:55,841
[tense music playing]

1376
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,311
Gigi Goode.

1377
00:53:59,378 --> 00:54:01,880
On the runway,
you had a good night, bitch.

1378
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,814
[chuckles]

1379
00:54:02,881 --> 00:54:05,917
But your commercial was... sleeper.

1380
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,688
You're safe.

1381
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,857
Thank you.

1382
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:14,960
Widow Von'Du.

1383
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,929
On the runway, you were dazzling,

1384
00:54:18,597 --> 00:54:21,199
but your commercial
did not leave us gagging.

1385
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:25,203
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1386
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:29,074
Sherry Pie,

1387
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:31,877
the judges ate up your runway look,

1388
00:54:32,844 --> 00:54:35,447

we love your black wedding look,

1392
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,422
but your commercial...

1393
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:46,758
left us unsure, Jan.

1394
00:54:50,062 --> 00:54:51,096
Sherry Pie.

1395
00:54:53,365 --> 00:54:54,433
You're safe.

00:54:59,204 --> 00:55:00,672
You may join the other girls.

1397
00:55:04,543 --> 00:55:08,413

Two queens stand before me.

1402
00:55:18,156 --> 00:55:20,258

to impress me

1407
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:32,404
