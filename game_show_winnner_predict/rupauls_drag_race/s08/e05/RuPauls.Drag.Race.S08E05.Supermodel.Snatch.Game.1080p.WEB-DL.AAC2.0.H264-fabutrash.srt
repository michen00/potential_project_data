    your own New Wave bands.    

3
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,113

should be cardboard cutout      

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,449
geometric shapes.               

5

          - Yeah, no.           

6

         of the world          

9
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:30,292

11

  were you in charge of that?   

12
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:34,862
  - It was a group challenge.   

13
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,263
       - Well, Chi Chi's        
       shaking her head.        

14
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:37,898

    Thorgy had on her head.     

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,198
 That's what I wanted to wear.  

16

          - Oh, Lord.           

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,216
  - How do you feel, Chi Chi?   

26
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:40,252
   - Tonight there was a lot    
    of drama on the runway.     

27
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:42,053
        I ain't gonna be        
      in no bottom again.       

28
00:01:42,055 --> 00:01:43,587
    - I apologize, Derrick.     

29
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:46,522
If I'm feelin' some kind of way,
    I completely shut down.     

30
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,391
           - Mm-hmm.            
  - And I have to change that.  

31
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,961
   I mean, it's just me being   
      a bitch. I'm sorry.       

32
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,529
            - Yeah,             
   it was you being a bitch.    

33
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:59,234
  Well, this is my second week  
      in the bottom three.      

34
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:01,035
I am so happy to still be here. 

35
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,637
        - I was in shock        
that it was not you lip-syncing.

36
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:05,072
         It was Naysha.         

37
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:07,273
     - But Chris and Debbie     
      thought I stood out.      

38
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:09,942
    Chris was like, "I think    
 you could impersonate Debbie.  

39
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:11,376
And we'll take you out on tour."

40
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:13,979
 - They may have been on drugs. 
      I want a drug test.       

41
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:15,579
            - Yeah,             
  I didn't hear you get that.   

42
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,114
             But--              
        - I did get told        

43
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,614
      that my performance       
        was phenomenal.         

44
00:02:18,616 --> 00:02:20,182
   Which you didn't get told.   

45
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:21,516
          - All right.          

46
00:02:21,518 --> 00:02:22,616
       - Derrick, I think       
   you just missed the point,   

47
00:02:22,618 --> 00:02:24,017
    but it's not a big deal.    
            - Okay.             

48
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,518
       Well, I don't know       
     if there was a point.      

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,120
     It's just Bob talking      
  is your point all the time.   

50
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:29,922
     - But you'll do, like,     
      side shady comments,      

51
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:31,389
        and it's funny,         
    but when I do side shady    

52
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,791
   comments, it's like, over.   
    - No. No, but what you--    

53
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:34,692
    - Anyone else see this?     
     Am I on Lonely Island?     

54
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:37,194
 Am I on Staten Island or am I  
 living in Manhattan right now? 

55
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:38,528
        - You're right.         
          - Thank you.          

56
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,262
           - [laughs]           
 - I don't see that I do that.  

57
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:41,296
         - I can't wait         
     till you do it again.      

58
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:44,332
 It'll be, like, five minutes.  

59
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,534
- Lord have mercy.              

60
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:47,668
- The two of you, honey.        

61
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,670
     That is a pot boiling.     

62
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,138
       - Derrick's, like,       
         "I ain't never         

63
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,273
 make jokes about anyone ever." 

64
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,675
          - Hey, Bob.           

65
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,609
        If I want to do         
    ratchet drag next week,     

66
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,010
   can you give me any tips?    

67
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:01,477
         - Ooh hoo hoo!         

68
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,413
   - If you want to do, like,   
   memorable drag next week,    

69
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,113
   I can give you some tips.    
           - [laughs]           

70
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:07,115
     - So all I need to do      
       is not wear a wig        

71
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,683
      and I'll be told by       
  the judges that I'm pretty.   

72
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,918
            - Babe.             
  - Didn't I remind you guys?   

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,419
I said, "In about five minutes, 

74
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,187
   she'd make a shady comment   
        out of nowhere"?        

75
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:15,688
          - And I did.          

76
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,189
   - What I said wasn't meant   
     to hurt your feelings.     

77
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:18,523
 You're trying to be spiteful.  
    You see the difference?     

78
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,990
       - Your intentions        
      weren't to hurt me?       

79
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,258
  - No, they weren't to hurt.   
    If I wanted to hurt you,    

80
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,358
        you'd be cryin'         
       right now, bitch.        

81
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,661
       - I will never cry       
        over you at all.        

82
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,896
  - Don't give me a challenge.  

83
00:03:27,898 --> 00:03:30,932
   - I work on the strip with   
 really big drag personalities. 

84
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:33,501
        So if you think         
   you're gonna come for me,    

85
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:35,003
    I am not that innocent.

00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:54,197
         Make me laugh.         

126
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,398
     There's nothing to it.     

127
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,466
    Bang, bang, bang, bang.     

128
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:00,068
           [laughter]           

129
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,002
      Hello, hello, hello.      

130
00:05:02,004 --> 00:05:03,871
     [cheers and applause]      

131
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:04,872
                          - Wow.

132
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:05,905
- Ladies.                       

133
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,807
For this week's maxi challenge, 

134
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,309
      we're going to break      
      out of the studio         

135
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,546
          as we drive           
  along the Hollywood freeway   

136
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:16,649
  looking for fresh roadkill.   

137
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,151
  Then, back in the workroom,   

138
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:24,487
    you'll need to transform    
     the furry little pelts     

139
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:27,356
       into evening gowns       
          that scream           

140
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:30,659
       "#CritterCouture."       

141
00:05:30,661 --> 00:05:32,327
           Oh, hell,            
       who am I kiddin'?        

142
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,795
       It's time to play        
        the Snatch Game.        

143
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:35,996
     [cheers and applause]      

144
00:05:35,998 --> 00:05:38,297
- [laughing]                    

145
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,833
          #SnatchGame.          

146
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,100
  Now, you know how it works.   

147
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:45,003
    Impersonate a celebrity,    
      fill in the blanks,       

148
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:46,304
      and stake your claim      

149
00:05:46,306 --> 00:05:49,306
       as a front-runner        
      in this competition.      

150
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,075
 Gentlemen, start your engines. 

151
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:55,344
  And may the best woman win.   

152
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:59,281
           [applause]           

153
00:05:59,283 --> 00:06:00,281
- Who you doin', baby?          

154
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:01,882
 - I was gonna do Nancy Grace.  

155
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,917
- Which is brilliant by the way.
  - Yeah, I think it's funny.   

156
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:06,485
 - Because she's so, so funny.  
        - Over the top.         

157
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,821
   - Oh, she's the craziest.    
            - Right.            

158
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:11,390
    - And just have outrage     
     at every--everything.      

159
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:12,991
        - Every corner.         

160
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,992
       I'm impersonating        
     Nancy Grace, herself,      

161
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:17,428
       because she seems        
      like a major bitch,       

162
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,062
   and I can relate to that.    

163
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:20,296
                       - Robbie,
    what are you thinkin' about?

164
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:22,231
  - I'm doing Diana Vreeland.   
             - Who?             

165
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:23,565
      - She was the first       
        editor in chief         

166
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:26,001
    of "Vogue" in the '60s.     
             - Oh.              

167
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:27,635
Do you think                    
that's a hair obscure?          

168
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,036
             - No.              
          Not at all.           

169
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,505
     I have been practicing     
   Diana Vreeland for months.   

170
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:34,207
Jinkx Monsoon and BenDeLaCreme, 

171
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:36,175
    my Seattle sister wives,    

172
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:39,211
   won Snatch Game each year    
       that they were on.       

173
00:06:39,213 --> 00:06:43,915
        So there's a lot        
 of pressure on me to be great. 

174
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:45,082
                - What character
                  are you doing?

175
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,284
- Well, I was going             
to do Whoopi Goldberg.          

176
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,452
  "The Color Purple" is, like,  
   one of my favorite movies.   

177
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:50,820
     And it's so quotable.      

178
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,021
         Everyone knows         
      "The Color Purple."       

179
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:53,322
            - Yeah.             
   <i> - I've been working on it</i>   

180
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,456
 since I found out I was gonna  
        be on the show.         

181
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,926
  And I cannot wait to be able  
to prove that I am a performer. 

182
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:01,528
  I'm not just a runway queen.  

183
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,695
      - Who are you doing?      

184
00:07:02,697 --> 00:07:04,897
                      - I'm torn
        between Whoopi Goldberg,

185
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:06,365
           Uzo Aduba,           

186
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,966
   who is an actress on, um,    

187
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,534
  "Orange Is The New Black"...  
          - Oh, yeah.           

188
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:11,770
      - And my last choice      
    is probably my favorite,    

189
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,338
 but I look the least like her, 
       is Carol Channing.       

190
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,273
       - Why would you do--well.

191
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:17,841
      <i> - I know some folks</i>      
      <i> are gonna question</i>       

192
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,776
    why is a 6'2" black man     

193
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:21,244
 doing Carol Channing, but it's 

194
00:07:21,246 --> 00:07:22,812
  because I feel a connection   
      with Carol Channing.      

195
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:24,780
          I really do.          
    - See, isn't this not--     

196
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:26,848
          Miss Celie?           
           - [laughs]           

197
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,750
   - You really do look like    
          Miss Celie.           

198
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:30,484
       - I sure is ugly.        

199
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,819
- I want to show you how much   
I look like Whoopi Goldberg.    

200
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:35,221
    - So Bob basically has,     
      like, ten characters      

201
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:37,290
   that he could possibly do.   

202
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:39,391
    All the sudden, he's got    
  the "Sister Act" outfit on.   

203
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:41,994
   He is, like, really giving   
       that Whoopi look.        

204
00:07:41,996 --> 00:07:44,095
- I think that if you hit a man,

205
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,463
      a man has the right       
       to knock you out.        

206
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,264
         You don't want         
      to get hit by a man,      

207
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,799
don't go around hittin' people. 
     That's all I'm sayin'.     

208
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,834
        - This is gonna         
       be the Whoopi Game       

209
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,235
  instead of the Snatch Game.   

210
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,136
        - I'm realizing,        
           "Oh, shit.           

211
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:54,937
         I might be out         
      of my league here."       

212
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:58,974
    So I'm gonna have to go     
     with my plan B backup.     

213
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:32,140
      - Bob is so excited       
        for Snatch Game,        

214
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:33,574
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

215
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,344
     - Today's challenge--      
       Ding! Ding! Ding!        

216
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:39,279
    Is gonna be Snatch Game.    

217
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:40,680
<i> It's a celebrity impersonation,</i>

218
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:42,481
          <i> so you have</i>          
     <i> to make people laugh.</i>     

219
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:45,117
     So I'm gonna be busier     
     than a one-legged cat      

220
00:08:45,119 --> 00:08:46,250
      in a sandbox tryin'       

221
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,786
     to win this challenge.     

222
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:50,320
      - Hey, celebrities.       

223
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,322
           all: Hey!            

224
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,757
        - Are you ready         
    to snatch my attention?     

225
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,192
          [all cheer]           

226
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,160
          Hi, Chi Chi.          
           - Mama Ru.           

227
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,861
                      - [laughs]
              Who are you doing?

228
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:02,663
    - I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.    
           - Uh-huh.            

229
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,898
          How are you gonna make
                   Eartha funny?

230
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,136
- Um, I know                    
that she played Catwoman        

231
00:09:09,138 --> 00:09:12,538
  and I have two cats at home.  
   I'm just gonna play off--    

232
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,172
   - Well, that--there it is!   

233
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,775
  You've got two cats at home.  

234
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:20,144
            To play Snatch Game,
you've got to stay in character,

235
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:22,446
and you've got to make me laugh.

236
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:24,213
            - Yeah.             
- All right. See you out there. 

237
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,982
          - All right.          
          - Thank you.          

238
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,516
          Hi, Kim Chi.          

239
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,885
        Have you decided on what
 character you're gonna portray?

240
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,920
- Um, there's two characters    
I'm debating between.           

241
00:09:31,922 --> 00:09:35,590
First one is...Pearl.           

242
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,529
 Is there something on my face? 

243
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,398
           - [laughs]           

244
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,799
     - I started doing drag     
          with Pearl,           

245
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,401
     <i> who was on season 7,</i>      

246
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:50,569
     <i> so I know her quirks</i>      
         <i> really well.</i>          

247
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:51,669
        - Right. Right.         

248
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:52,804
                  And who's your
                other character?

249
00:09:52,806 --> 00:09:54,238
        - The other one         
      is kind of obscure.       

250
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,776
           - Uh-huh.            
    - Kimmy Jong-un, maybe.     

251
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:00,377
            - Kimmy?            
         - Kimmy, yeah.         

252
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:02,311
 Kimmy Jong-un is a huge risk,  

253
00:10:02,313 --> 00:10:04,413
         but if I turn          
   the North Korean dictator    

254
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,781
  into a drag version of him,   
      it would be a chance      

255
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,716
        <i> for me to show</i>         
    <i> another side of Kim Chi</i>    

256
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:10,684
   that's a little fucked up.   

257
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,152
             - Huh.             
      That's interesting.       

258
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,419
Listen, whatever works for you. 

259
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:15,687
        Just so long as         
       you make me laugh.       

260
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:17,789
       - Kimmy Jong-what?       

261
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,191
     <i> A made-up character,</i>      
          <i> my friend.</i>           

262
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:23,094
       I really hope that       
    lands her in the bottom.    

263
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:25,296
       -  Hey, Derrick        
         -  Hey, Ru           

264
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:26,630
  - Are you gonna do Brittney?  

265
00:10:26,632 --> 00:10:28,832
       - It's an obvious choice.

266
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,067
     But this is my chance      
        to show everyone        

267
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:32,401
       that I'm more than       

268
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:34,236
 just a Brittney impersonator.  
           - Uh-huh.            

269
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:35,704
            - And so            
      I think I'm gonna go      

270
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:37,739
    with Laura Bell Bundy's     
           character.           

271
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,774
             - Yes,             
    she's the country singer    

272
00:10:39,776 --> 00:10:41,242
         Broadway star.         
            - Right.            

273
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:42,776
        And she made up         

274
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:44,544
     all these characters,      
        and Shocantelle         

275
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:46,212
      is my favorite one.       
           - Uh-huh.            

276
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,681
     - She is a black girl      
trapped in a white girl's body. 

277
00:10:48,683 --> 00:10:50,048
             - Ah.              

278
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,182
     Can I see a little bit     

279
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,685
    of your Laura Bell Bundy    
           character?           

280
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,586
        - Hello, RuPaul.        
           I am here.           

281
00:10:56,588 --> 00:10:59,455
       My Shocantelle you       
    that I do have a penis.     

282
00:11:01,325 --> 00:11:03,824
- You know, sometimes           
the most obvious thing          

283
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:05,559
is the thing to do.             

284
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,894
You just have to decide         
where you want to go.           

285
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:10,296
        Stakes are high.        
 There's $100,000 on the line.  

286
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,597
      - Yeah, that's true.      

287
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,265
     - All right, Derrick.      
        - Thank you, Ru.        

288
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,700
             - Bye.             
             - Bye.             

289
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:16,335
          - Oh, Lord.           

290
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:20,371
         - Thorgy Thor.         
          - That's me.          

291
00:11:20,373 --> 00:11:21,471
  - Wait a minute, let me see.  

292
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,639
        I'm getting, uh,        

293
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,041
        Charles Manson.         
             - No.              

294
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:28,711
             - No?              
- Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.

295
00:11:28,713 --> 00:11:31,112
    - How are you gonna make    
     Michael Jackson funny?     

296
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,814
      - His little quirks.      
      His little movements      

297
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,316
       that I have down.        

298
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,583
            - Yeah.             

299
00:11:36,585 --> 00:11:38,118
              Who's your biggest
               competition here?

300
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,552
 - You know, I'm gonna say Bob. 

301
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:42,154
You know, what you're asking us 
to do in this season,           

302
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:45,157
Bob is really excelling at,     
which is pissing me off.        

303
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,691
   - Well, let me tell you this,
                         Thorgy.

304
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,958
    And this might help you.    

305
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,793
        You second-guess        
and you take it into your head. 

306
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,594
         - Constantly.          
    - This is an opportunity    

307
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:54,164
   for you to feel confident    
      going with your gut       

308
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,098
  and not overthinking things.  

309
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,399
            - Yeah.             
      - All right, Thorgy.      

310
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,468
    I'll see you out there.     
            - Okay.             

311
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,569
      - All right, ladies.      

312
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,070
         Gather round.          

313
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:06,840
    Tomorrow on the runway,     
        the category is

         iconic looks.          

317
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,082
      I can't wait to see       
 what everybody comes up with.  

318
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:18,717
     It's gonna be amazing.     

319
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:22,053

   'cause it's a celebration.

00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:31,438
       I'm worried about

     any panties, are you?

  <i> [exciting game show music]</i>   

374
00:14:54,642 --> 00:14:57,609
 - Welcome back to Snatch Game. 

375
00:14:57,611 --> 00:14:59,244
Here's how the game works.      

376
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,913
       I ask a question,        
     and you give an answer     

377
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:05,349
that you think will match       
our supermodel contestants.     

378
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:06,417
          - [giggles]           

379
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,785
       - First question.        
          Gigi Hadid.           

380
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:11,754
    There's a new dating app    
        for drag queens.        

381
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:13,221
         When you join,         

382
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:17,525
  the first question they ask   
  is, "How big is your blank?"  

383
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:19,494
    Let's go to Gigi Hadid.     

384
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,029
     - How big is your wig?     

385
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:22,664
         - I love that!         

386
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,698
   Let's go to our superstars   

387
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,399
          and find out          
    if you got any matches.     

388
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,399
            - Okay.             

389
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:30,168
- Let's start with Kimmy Jong-un

390
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,536
       from North Korea.        

391
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:34,672
       The first question       
they ask is, "How big is your"? 

392
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,841
         - I wrote down         
  weapons of ass destruction.   

393
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:39,943
 - Weapons of ass destruction.  

394
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:43,546
          Not a match.          
      [laughing] I--yeah.       

395
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:46,548
        Well, thank you,        
 the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-un. 

396
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,284
        Ms. Eartha Kitt.        

397
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:52,420
   - Well, I'm sorry, Gigi...   

398
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:53,554
           [laughter]           

399
00:15:53,556 --> 00:15:57,256
          But I said,           
       "Big furry balls."       

400
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,325
     - How big is your big      
          furry balls?          

401
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:02,060
     - Honey, get your mind     
       out of the gutter.       

402
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,294
          - Of course.          

403
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,463
           [laughing]           
          - [purring]           

404
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,932
   - Prosecutor Nancy Grace.    

405
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,535
  - Well, as everybody knows,   
 not only do I do newscasting,  

406
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,404
 but I also was on another show 
        where I danced.         

407
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,607
      So I said, "How big       
       are your bunions?"       

408
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,974
 - What do you do for bunions?  

409
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,776
       - Well, I was told       
  you can get 'em shaved off.   

410
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,845
      That's what they do.      
  I'm about to get that done.   

411
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:23,878
          - All right.          
          Sorry, Gigi.          

412
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,679
          Not a match.          

413
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:28,348
        Let's move on to        
  Tiffany "New York" Pollard.   

414
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,849
    - How big is your clock?    

415
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:34,152
     - Because drag queens      
  love a big-ass clock, right?  

416
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:36,354
       [feeble laughter]        

417
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,923
- Ru seems to be throwing Naomi 
    every bone she can find.    

418
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:43,260
   - Do you like a big clock,   
           yourself?            

419
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:45,362
  - But this dog won't catch.   

420
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,662
         - Chanel Iman.         

421
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,331
  It's your turn now, darling.  

422
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,667
        The big bad wolf        
        is a drag queen.        

423
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:53,602
      Instead of huffing,       
          and puffing,          

424
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:54,937
          and blowing,          

425
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:57,606
   she blanks the house down.   

426
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:58,640
           - Shakes?            

427
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,008
       - She gonna shake        
        the house down.         

428
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,009
        Shake that ass.         

429
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:03,376
             - Mm.              

430
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:04,644
       - All right, well,       
  let's go to our celebrities   

431
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,478
          and find out          
     if you've got a match.     

432
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,746
          Let's start           
     with Latoya's brother,     

433
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:09,947
        Michael Jackson.        

434
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:11,415
         - I just said,         
       "Takes a long nap        

435
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:13,517
            in a bed            
   with everyone they know."    

436
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,952
    - Michael, that's crazy.    
          - Thank you.          

437
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:18,087
           [laughter]           

438
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,521
           - Mm-hmm.            

439
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,555
        - Let's move on         
    down to Diana Vreeland.     

440
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,957
        - I used to work        
     for "Vogue" magazine.      

441
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,492
            But I heard that now
          "Vogue" means a dance.

442
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:30,430
     So I think they vogue      
        the house down.         

443
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,865
            - Girl.             
    This performance is poo.    

444
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:36,234
 And you're from the same town  
       as Jinkx and Dela?       

445
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:38,302
           Ooh, girl.           
     Them girls is gonna--      

446
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:39,803
       I was about to say       
      they gonna hang you,      

447
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:40,804
  but I ain't gonna say that.   

448
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,505
            [laughs]            

449
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:44,407
         - Eartha Kitt.         

450
00:17:44,409 --> 00:17:46,775
  Instead of huffing, puffing   
          and blowing,          

451
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:48,576
   she blanks the house down.   

452
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:50,477
     - She licks the house.     

453
00:17:50,479 --> 00:17:52,813
             - Ooh.             
     Licks the house down.      

454
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:56,283
    - And speaking of lick,     
     it's time for my bath.     

455
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,283
            - What?             
           Oh, you--            

456
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,651
            [laughs]            

457
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:00,652
          - [giggles]           

458
00:18:00,654 --> 00:18:02,654
           [laughter]           

459
00:18:02,656 --> 00:18:04,421
           - Ha, ha.            
      That's what cats do.      

460
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:05,356
        Ha, ha, ha, ha.         

461
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:09,659
          Eartha Kitt           
    didn't do that, Chi Chi.    

462
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:11,427
      - Let's move on down      
        to Britney Jean.        

463
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,529
  - She reads the house down.   

464
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,664
     - That's not a match,      
  unfortunately, Chanel Iman.   

465
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,499
      But has Eartha Kitt       
        got your tongue?        

466
00:18:18,501 --> 00:18:19,933
 - I've had that tongue before. 

467
00:18:19,935 --> 00:18:22,002
          - You have?           
     - Good girls gone bad.     

468
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:23,937
- Yeah.                         

469
00:18:23,939 --> 00:18:25,672
         - Yeah, yeah,          
       yeah, yeah, yeah.        

470
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:27,073
                 - You should do
             that one more time.

471
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:29,508
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.             

472
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,610
I would be very                 
popular in prison.              

473
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,679
           [laughter]           

474
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:37,048
          - All right.          
          Crazy Eyes.           

475
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,083
     - Because you pretty,      
     I just wrote a poem...     

476
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,684
            - Yeah.             
           - To Iman.           

477
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,519
   A-Once a queen named Iman    

478
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:47,556
           remind me of the Sun.

479
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:50,759
                  Instead of her
                supermodel life,

480
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,161
         She can be...          

481
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,228
            my wife.            

482
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,497
           [laughter]           

483
00:18:56,499 --> 00:19:00,233
    - Unfortunately, Chanel,    
      that is not a match.      

484
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:01,266
                  Next question.

485
00:19:01,268 --> 00:19:03,167
    Let's go to Gigi Hadid.     

486
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,503
 Lady Bunny has an unusual way  
   of celebrating gay pride.    

487
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,105
  Instead of the rainbow flag,  

488
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,374
      she hangs her blank       
        out the window.         

489
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:15,276
     - Her tucking panties.     

490
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,878
- Let's go to the king          
of pop and hear                 

491
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,913
if you have a match.            

492
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:20,281
           - Oh, Ru.            
       It's not a match,        

493
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,482
     but I said, "She waves     
         her blanket."          

494
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:24,083
           Say "Hi."            
       - Oh, hi, Blanket.       

495
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:26,018
         - Hi, Blanket.         
        Hi, hi. Bye-bye.        

496
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,786
- Oh, please be careful.        
You don't want Blanket to fall. 

497
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:28,786
              No.               
        - Oh, thank you.        

498
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:29,786
             - Yes.             

499
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,955
          - [scatting]          

500
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:34,757
        - Moving on down        
 to Tiffany "New York" Pollard. 

501
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,061
    - When I think of Pride,    
     I think of...my hair.      

502
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:42,397
     So I said $800 weave?      

503
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,165
    - That's an $800 weave?     

504
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:45,766
       - Well, of course.       
            Blended.            

505
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,367
             - Yes.             
             - Yes.             

506
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,535
     <i> - Naomi's "New York"?</i>     

507
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:54,472
       - I'm sorry, Gigi.       

508
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:55,906
         You didn't get         
       a match this time.       

509
00:19:55,908 --> 00:19:57,007
        Maybe next time.        

510
00:19:57,009 --> 00:19:59,109
     Well, look who's here.     

511
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:01,510
                     - I'm sorry
                  that I'm late.

512
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:05,214
      But, uh, Uzo Abu-boo      
         left the stage         

513
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:07,316
        and she asked me        
      if I would fill in.       

514
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:09,351
    - Ladies and Gentlemen,     
        Carol Channing.         

515
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:10,752
        - Oh, thank you.        

516
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:13,021
           [laughter]           

517
00:20:13,023 --> 00:20:14,121
          - All right.          
          Chanel Iman.          

518
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,289
      Sally the Supermodel      

519
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,424
   is so lactose intolerant,    

520
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:23,228
     when the photographer      
  says, "cheese," she blanks.   

521
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,362
           - Sneezes.           
         - She sneezes!         

522
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:28,231
 Let's go down to Nancy Grace.  

523
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,600
- She sends out an Amber Alert. 

524
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,602
   - Nancy Grace is terrible.   

525
00:20:34,604 --> 00:20:36,036
        - It's important        
      to keep the children      

526
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,270
     safe from the boozers      

527
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:40,840
         and the users          
    and the reefer smokers.     

528
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:42,441
       <i> - It's lifeless.</i>        

529
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:46,178
   It's basically Acid Betty    
   turned into Boring Betty.    

530
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,913
      - Let's move on down      
       to Britney Spears,       

531
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:49,381
      the princess of pop.      

532
00:20:49,383 --> 00:20:50,414
         - She, "Oops.          

533
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,481
        I did it again."        

534
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,016
             - Ahh.             
          - [giggles]           

535
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,484
- Do you mean                   
between me down there?          

536
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,951
      - She had diarrhea.       

537
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:58,786
           [laughter]           

538
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,655
          - All right,          
let's move on to Diana Vreeland.

539
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:02,857
    - I've worked with Sally    
          for so long.          

540
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,958
    She pops a pill, RuPaul.    

541
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,860
        She pops a pill.        

542
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:09,062
    - There is so much talk     
          about drugs.          

543
00:21:09,064 --> 00:21:10,463
      I have-haven't taken      
      anything but Lipitor      

544
00:21:10,465 --> 00:21:12,531
    for the past ten years.     

545
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,432
        You don't really        
    get a buzz off of that.     

546
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:16,601
- Now, is there an anal option? 

547
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:19,269
- I might happen to have a Fleet
       or two in my home.       

548
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:20,770
- A Fleet enema.                

549
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,104
       Now you're talkin'       
          my language.          

550
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:25,207
            - If you stay ready,
     you ain't got to get ready.

551
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,374
      By the way, Eartha,       

552
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,810
         I didn't know          
    that was you down there.    

553
00:21:28,812 --> 00:21:30,344
      - It's me, darling.       
          - From here,          

554
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:33,414
  I couldn't tell if you were   
Della Reese or Luther Vandross. 

555
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:35,048
                 I couldn't see.

556
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,784
               These aren't even
                my good glasses.

557
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:39,886
                     But back to
             the matter at hand.

558
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,587
      I just wrote "corn".      

559
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:44,389
 - That's always a good answer. 
 - You know, there's no dairy.  

560
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:47,359
    And it comes out the way    
     you put it in, RuPaul.     

561
00:21:48,662 --> 00:21:50,894
        - Well, listen.         
On that note, I am sorry, folks,

562
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:52,729
  but we are well out of time.  

563
00:21:52,731 --> 00:22:26,663
                 It was a really
                     close game,

564
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:28,498
          <i> - [laughs]</i>

     I can't believe she--

568
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:36,103
      - Always the first.

    <i> - It's elimination day,</i>    

570
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,173
         and it is the          
   Night of the 100 Madonnas.   

571
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:42,575
     And as I'm pulling out     
           my kimono,           

572
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:45,244
      I see Thorgy's also       
   pulling out a red kimono.    

573
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:47,179
    Great minds think alike?    

574
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,249
   - In New York, it's funny.   
   It's like we're always put   

575
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:55,018
    in these boxes of, like,    
   what people's expectations   

576
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,319
  of who we are as, you know,   

577
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,820
         drag artists?          
             - Yes.             

578
00:22:57,822 --> 00:23:00,656
       - Now, even people       
 are putting Brooklyn in a box. 

579
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:02,924
 - Brooklyn doesn't accept me.

00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:06,760
 <i> who do not interact with me.</i>  

582
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:08,595
   It sucks that none of them   
      ask me to be a part       

583
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,663
      of their community.       

584
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:13,732
  So I don't fit in anywhere.   

585
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:16,101
 There are certain definitions  
           of "drag."           

586
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,935
     You know, and there's,     

587
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:19,603
  like, "I'm put in it 'cause   
     I'm the 'look queen.'"     

588
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,037
        I've had fights         
       with those people        

589
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,204
    where they're like, "Oh,    
    you're not a drag queen.    

590
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:23,772
      You just do looks."       
         - Yes. Mm-hmm.         

591
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:26,908
   <i> - It hurts me, actually,</i>    
   <i> that I'm a lone soldier.</i>    

592
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,776
          And I think           
     that's that huge wall      

593
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:32,146
    that I put in between me    
 and myself and everybody else. 

594
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:33,947
      I think this show's       
   a great platform, though,    

595
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:35,415
    because it kind of shows    

596
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,982
   that we do something more    
     than just stand around     

597
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,450
        and serve booze.        
             - Yup.             

598
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:39,650
   - You know, or sit around    
        and be a bitch.         

599
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:40,817
            - Yeah.             

600
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,151
          - You know,           
     I do all these shows.      

601
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:43,786
    I make all these things.    
    But I'm also a musician.    

602
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:46,689
  What I really want to do is,  
       like, do a grand,        

603
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:48,623
          like, event,          
         like, "Thorgy          

604
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,957
     and the Thorchestra."      
          - Fabulous.           

605
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,558
 - Like, a 40-piece orchestra,  

606
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,227
 and I want to conduct in drag. 

607
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:56,796
<i> I am a professional violinist,</i> 
       <i> violist, cellist.</i>

     <i> You know, I've played</i>     
 <i> at Carnegie Hall many times.</i>  

609
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,064
        <i> I feel like I'm</i>        
      <i> the perfect medium</i>       

610

    <i> the younger generation</i>     

611
00:24:01,668 --> 00:24:04,167
 and make Classical music cool. 

612
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,102
   It's a throwback to, like,   
      events where, like,       

613
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:08,204
   you dressed up just to get   
       on the red carpet.       

614
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:10,006
         - I love that.         

615
00:24:10,008 --> 00:24:11,674
- Do you have any siblings, Bob?

616
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:13,474
- I have two brothers, actually.

617
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:15,109
           - Uh-huh.            
    - How many do you have?     

618
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:17,678
    - I have eight brothers     
       and three sisters.       

619

        - That is crazy.        

620
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,181

            - Yeah.             

621
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:23,048
  - Did they have a talk where  
 they were, like, "You know--"  

622
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,850
Where they went, like, one day, 
like, "Well, just so you know." 

623
00:24:24,852 --> 00:24:26,184

  it's--like it's very obvious  

624
00:24:26,186 --> 00:24:27,685
       that I'm adopted.        
     These are my parents.      

625
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:29,386
         So growing up          
      with white parents.

       the best mom ever.       

629
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:37,059
 I'm literally the only gay one 
         in my family.          

630
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:40,595

    a Christian background,

00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,600
  And my mom has done nothing   
   but make me feel accepted.   

634

       an amazing woman.

         I love my mom.         

636

  Growing up, I literally had,  
     like, the best parents     

637

to just study up on black stuff?

639
00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:59,610
           - Kind of.           
    It wasn't a weird thing     

640
00:24:59,612 --> 00:25:01,678
  until I got to high school,   
         middle school.         

641
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,579
    People were throwing out    
        all these, like,        

642
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:06,048
       black references.        
    And I was, like, "Wait.     

643
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,882
     What does that mean?"

    was, like, second-hand?     

645
00:25:09,786 --> 00:25:11,752
          - I grew up           
    in an all-black family.     

646
00:25:11,754 --> 00:25:13,687
I went to all-black high school,
  all-black elementary school   

647
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:15,622

      black middle school.      

648

      like, all the time.       

649
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,424
       - It's obnoxious.        
        - Or, like, "Oh,        

650
00:25:19,426 --> 00:25:21,058
       he's kind of cute

     <i> It's all hand-painted</i>     
    <i> with my little patches.</i>    

745
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:45,381
 - I wonder if she's a pitcher  
         or a catcher.          

746
00:28:45,383 --> 00:28:47,148
           - Me too.            

747
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,083
       - Chi Chi DeVayne.       

748
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:51,418
  You're gonna poke somebody's  
  eyes out with those things.   

749
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,453
       - If you're lucky.       

750
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:53,586
 <i> - When you think of Madonna,</i>  

751
00:28:53,588 --> 00:28:55,254
  <i> you think of the cone bra.</i>   

752
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,088
     <i> Bitch, I look good.</i>       
          - Oh, yeah.           

753
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,791
      It's--she's totally       
      expressing herself.       

754
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:02,560
       I think she likes        
     a little hanky-panky.      

755
00:29:02,562 --> 00:29:04,728
      Bob The Drag Queen.       
             - Oh!              

756
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,664
      - Not to be confused      
  with Bob the camp counselor.  

757
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,732
           - I love.            

758
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:40,597
  <i> - My favorite Madonna look</i>   

759
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,531
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

760
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,999
       - Welcome, ladies.       

761
00:29:44,001 --> 00:29:47,202
     When I call your name,     
      please step forward       

762
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,235
       and strike a pose.       

763
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:50,236
   - [whispers indistinctly]    

764
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:53,106
           - Kim Chi.           

765
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:56,642
        Chi Chi DeVayne.        

766
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:58,945
       You're both safe.        

767
00:29:58,947 --> 00:29:59,945
          - Thank you.          

768
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:02,814
   - You may leave the stage.   

769
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,448
   Oh, the power of good-bye.   

770
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,316
           - [laughs]           

771
00:30:06,318 --> 00:30:10,219
      - Ladies, it's time       
   for the judges' critiques.   

772
00:30:10,221 --> 00:30:11,754
           - Tonight            
         on the runway,         

773
00:30:11,756 --> 00:30:13,455
          I don't know          
  if you guys had some kind of  

774
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:16,157
       symbiotic message        
         to each other,         

775
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,426
  but there's a lot of kimonos  
   which is very interesting.   

776
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:21,260
Thorgy, you did your take on it.

777
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:23,862
     You kept it in geisha,     
  but still Thorgy's in there.  

778
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:26,732
     - The Michael Jackson      
          was so good.          

779
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:27,999
       I loved all of it.       

780
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:30,402
      - You kept character      
      better than anyone.       

781
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,403
  - It was everything for me.   

782
00:30:32,405 --> 00:30:35,206
     - Up next, Acid Betty.     

783
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,740
     - I was not expecting      
    to see "Bedtime Stories"    

784
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:37,840
         and the whole          
      bird-fly-out thing.       

785
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:39,742
       So kudos to that.        
          - Thank you.          

786
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:41,277
     - I think your make-up     
        is okay tonight.        

787
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,212
   It's nothing spectacular.    

788
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:46,648
But where I was really let down,
 was in the Snatch Game, Betty. 

789
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,782
   - It didn't look like her.   

790
00:30:47,784 --> 00:30:49,183
      It was like the wig       
        and the make-up,        

791
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:50,751
         you were like          
      a white Chaka Khan.       

792
00:30:50,753 --> 00:30:52,219
         - I didn't get         
    any Nancy Grace from it.    

793
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:53,987
          It felt like          
    you were just being you.    

794
00:30:53,989 --> 00:30:57,390
       It was just a fail       
      all the way around.       

795
00:30:57,392 --> 00:31:00,626
  - I wasn't sure how to turn   
  such a serious woman funny.   

796
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,227
    - I needed like a nasal,    
     angry southern voice.      

797
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:05,029
     And then she leans in,     

798
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,664
     and she wants to talk      
        to you on the TV        

799
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,399
like she's in your living room. 

800
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,400
           [laughter]           

801
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,102
 - I wish I had you as a coach. 

802
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,538
            - Okay.             

803
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,972
          - All right.          

804
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:17,507
    Up next, Robbie Turnter.    

805
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,208
- I really enjoyed your catwalk 

806
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,810
   because it was really fun    
          and playful.          

807
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,344
     - I was really excited     
          about Diana.          

808
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:26,380
And I--I think that most people 
   may not know who that is.    

809
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:28,281
        So I think that         
      how iconic she was,       

810
00:31:28,283 --> 00:31:30,150
 and the voice and everything,  
   you kind of have to shove    

811
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:31,818
     that in people's faces     
      for them to get it.       

812
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,454
     - You could have gone      
    so much bigger with her.    

813
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,289
   - Punk took my voice away.   

814
00:31:37,291 --> 00:31:38,924
    My voice kept cracking,     

815
00:31:38,926 --> 00:31:41,159
   and I was going in and out   
     during Diana Vreeland.     

816
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:43,127
            - Well,             
  we could hear you perfectly.  

817
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:46,530
It's just, we weren't impressed 
   with what was being said.    

818
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:50,133
     Up next, Naomi Smalls.     

819
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:52,135
     - It's becoming quite      
          predictable           

820
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:55,170
     for Naomi to come out      
    in basically, lingerie.     

821
00:31:55,172 --> 00:31:58,039
This is where we go, "Oh, maybe 
  I should switch it up now."   

822
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,174
       - In Snatch Game,        
   I got lost with the boobs.   

823
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:02,442
 I think if you would have just 
     stuffed it to the max,     

824
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:05,711
 it would of made the character 
   a lot more obvious to me.    

825
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:08,146
     - That was your moment     
          to go O-T-P.          

826
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:10,247
   - I was very underwhelmed    
      with my performance.      

827
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:11,548
     It was not coming out,     

828
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,182
         and I'm, like,         
    so embarrassed about it.    

829
00:32:13,184 --> 00:32:16,819
          - All right.          
       Thank you, Naomi.        

830
00:32:16,821 --> 00:32:19,121
    Up next, Derrick Barry.     

831
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:21,390
   - So we did Britney, huh?    

832
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:27,227
       I am so grateful.        

833
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:28,327
           - Oh, God.           

834
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:30,362
     - You done good, girl.     

835
00:32:30,364 --> 00:32:31,830
     - Me and Gigi really,      

836
00:32:31,832 --> 00:32:34,933
       really loved your        
 Britney performance yesterday. 

837
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:36,501
      - You kept character      
        the whole time.         

838
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:38,502
     You just were Britney.     
      - Thank you so much.      

839
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:39,770
     - Thank you, Derrick.      

840
00:32:39,772 --> 00:32:41,037
      Bob The Drag Queen.       

841
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,273
   - Tonight, on the runway.    
            Love it.            

842
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,974
- I love your Madonna look too. 

843
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:48,010
       And I know you're        
      a<i> huge</i> Madonna fan.       

844
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:49,478
       And, like, one of        
  your biggest thing you said,  

845
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,413
   was when Madonna sent you,   
   like, a cease and desist?    

846
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:52,948
             - Yes!             
           - [laughs]           

847
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,782
   - Best moment of my life.    
           - [laughs]           

848
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,216
         - The padding.         

849
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:57,918
         It's so good,          
     I wouldn't have known.     

850
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,152
  - You are serving "womana."   

851
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,087
   - This old luscious body.    

852
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:03,688
       - The Snatch Game.       

853
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,890
      Uzo Aduba, amazing.       

854
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:07,191
      - You were so good.       

855
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,893
    - Then, we get a little     
        Carol Channing.         

856
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:13,063
       You gave us extra,       
      which was wonderful.      

857
00:33:13,065 --> 00:33:15,198
  - I do want to caution you,   
            however.            

858
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,233
    Sometimes you borderline    
        on showboating.         

859
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:20,368
       Just keep that in        
     the back of your mind.     

860
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,269
           - Mm-hmm.            

861
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,503
      - All right, ladies.      

862
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:23,470
         Well, I think          
      we've heard enough.       

863
00:33:23,472 --> 00:33:25,504
  While you untuck backstage,   

864
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:28,507
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

865
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,774
           All right.           

866
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:32,376
      Now, just between us      
      material squirrels.       

867
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,011
           - [laughs]           
      - What do you think?      

868
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,445
          Thorgy Thor.          

869
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,247
     - Her Michael Jackson,     
     I thought was divine.      

870
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:40,115
     - She was really good      
    at making fun of things     

871
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,315
    that are a little taboo.    

872
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,250
   - She stayed in character    
        the entire time.        

873
00:33:43,252 --> 00:33:45,352
         I really felt          
    like Michael was there.     

874
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:48,388
         - Acid Betty.          
- Her runway was very creative. 

875
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:51,824
     - But her Nancy Grace      
 was more like Nancy Disgrace.  

876
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:52,991
         - Ooh, child.          

877
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:54,893
    - How does a drag queen     
         do Nancy Grace         

878
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:56,995
      and she doesn't even      
      have the wig right?       

879
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:58,829
      - You need a little       
        helmet-y blonde.        

880
00:33:58,831 --> 00:34:00,898
    And then you need a few     
    little Nancy Grace-isms.    

881
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,033
   And none of that happened.   
       It was just like,        

882
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:05,169
      she didn't even know      
      who Nancy Grace was.      

883
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,904
       - Robbie Turnter.        

884
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:09,072
- The "League of Their Own" look
    stood out from the rest.    

885
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:11,975
   I would give it a B plus.    
   - We love Diana Vreeland.    

886
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:13,809
        - We do, indeed.        

887
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,110
 Everything was wrong about it. 

888
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:17,145
       Why didn't she go        
    for the blown-back hair?    

889
00:34:17,147 --> 00:34:18,379
          - With the--          
   with the bump at the top.    

890
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:19,546
             - Yes!             

891
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:20,713
        - The worst part        
   of the whole thing tonight   

892
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:21,981
     with Robbie, was the--

       "I have no voice."       

895
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:25,983
           - Uh-huh.            
       - All of a sudden,       

896
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:27,451
you don't have a voice anymore? 

897
00:34:27,453 --> 00:34:29,152
     And I think she needs      
     to get out of her head     

898
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:30,686
      and get into my car.      

899
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:33,389
            - Okay.             
    All right, Billy Ocean.     

900
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:35,891
          Naomi Smalls          
      did Tiffany Pollard.      

901
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:37,325
           New York.            
   - She didn't do New York.    

902
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,126
   - She did not do New York.   
     - She wasn't New York.     

903
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:40,861
    She wasn't Connecticut.     
     She wasn't New Jersey.     

904
00:34:40,863 --> 00:34:43,096
    She wasn't Long Island.     
   I don't know what she was.   

905
00:34:43,098 --> 00:34:45,264
 - But, Naomi's was my favorite 
        of the kimonos.         

906
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:47,366
  She made me want to wear it,  
        but I don't know        

907
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:49,668
if it really screamed "Madonna."

908
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,002
        - Derrick Barry.        

909
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,169
  - The Britney blew me away.   

910
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,604
I was so excited for every time 

911
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,171
       that she was going       
     to answer a question.      

912
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,438
      - The runway thing,       

913
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,674
    I always find her a bit     
      timid on the runway.      

914
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:00,108
 - When you're on the catwalk,  

915
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,343
       you've got to just       
      give it all you got.      

916
00:35:02,345 --> 00:35:04,111
 - You know, I once asked Iman  

917
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:06,980
      what is on her mind       
         on the runway.         

918
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:10,183
   And she looked at me dead    
in the eyes and said, "Africa." 

919
00:35:10,185 --> 00:35:13,685
       - That's what I do       
       when I go to bars.       

920
00:35:13,687 --> 00:35:15,820
         - Oh, really?          
   - Yes. Think about Africa.   

921
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,854
           - Oh-kerr!           

922
00:35:16,856 --> 00:35:18,188
             - Oh--             
    [trills, clicks tongue]     

923
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:52,789

          Thorgy Thor.          

928
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:03,463
      Your Michael Jackson      
       was off the wall.        

929
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:08,067
     And your Madonna look      
   was something to remember.

      Bob The Drag Queen.

00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:13,172
         I's was crazy          
    about your Snatch Game.     

932

       And on the runway,       

933

945
00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:43,829
I took a risk, and it paid off. 

946

       Thank you so much.       

952
00:36:54,872 --> 00:36:56,271
         - Acid Betty,          

953
00:36:56,273 --> 00:37:00,108
        your runway was         
   an immaculate conception.    

954
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,844
  But your Nancy Grace left us  
            asking,             

955
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,245
       "Who's that girl?"

      I'm sorry, my dear,       
but you are up for elimination. 

957
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:11,885
       - I totally agree        
       with Snatch Game.        

958
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:14,854
           It sucked.           
 But I think Snatch Game sucks.

        - Robbie Turner,        

960
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:18,123
     your runway was a hit.     

961
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:22,461
      But your Snatch Game      
    was a swing and a miss.     

962
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:25,830
         Naomi Smalls,          

963
00:37:25,832 --> 00:37:28,265
your runway look was borderline.

964
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,967
     But your impersonation     
         of "New York"          

965
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:33,003
   bordered on "New Jersey."

        is mine to make.

00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:07,979
     <i>  And when it falls,</i>      
     <i> we won't let it die </i>     

1001
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:11,950
      <i>  It doesn't matter</i>      
     <i> if you win or lose </i>      

1002
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:13,584
<i>  It's how you play the game </i> 

1003
00:39:13,586 --> 00:39:15,719
  <i>  So get into the groove </i>   

1004
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:17,153
   <i> - All you hear is music.</i>    

1005
00:39:17,155 --> 00:39:18,888
    <i> You have no idea what's</i>    
     <i> happening around you.</i>     

1006
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,490
<i> And in that moment, you will do</i>
  <i> whatever it takes to stay.</i>   

1007
00:39:22,492 --> 00:39:24,526
        <i> -  Commotion </i>        

1008

        <i>  Is it mine? </i>        

1011

  <i>  Walk through that door </i>   

1012
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:34,667
    <i>  We're wasting time </i>     

1013

  <i>  And get into the groove </i>  

1015

   <i>  I got the moves, baby </i>   

1016
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:44,041
    <i>  You got the motion </i>     

1017
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:45,542
    <i>  If we got together </i>     

1018
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:49,713
<i>  We'd be causing a commotion </i>

1019

    <i>  Causing a commotion </i>    

1020

1021
00:39:56,554 --> 00:39:58,887
            - Yeah!             

1022
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:01,824
     [cheers and applause]      

1023
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:04,959
           - Ladies.            

1024
00:40:04,961 --> 00:40:06,494
     I've made my decision.

         Naomi Smalls,          

1026
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:15,902
       shantay, you stay.       

1027
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:17,070
             <i> - Oh.</i>             

1028
00:40:21,842 --> 00:40:23,441
         - Acid Betty.          

1029
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:27,378
        You've taken us         
       on one wild trip.        

1030
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,713
      Thanks for the high.      

1031
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:30,014
- Thank you for the opportunity.

1032
00:40:30,016 --> 00:40:31,482
       It's been amazing.       

1033
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:34,084
     And I'm so happy to be     
     a part of royalty now.     

1034
00:40:34,086 --> 00:40:37,354
      - Now, sashay away.       

1035
00:40:42,027 --> 00:40:45,361
       - I love you guys.       

1036
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:47,963
        Acid Betty out!         

1037
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,566
 I'm so happy that I came here. 

1038
00:40:52,568 --> 00:40:55,002
    I would not change this     
         for anything.          

1039
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,070
        Legends are born        
    in "RuPaul's Drag Race".    

1040
00:40:57,072 --> 00:40:59,573
And now I'm officially a legend.

1041
00:40:59,575 --> 00:41:01,641
        Bitches beware.         

1042
00:41:01,643 --> 00:41:06,045
    'Cause Acid Betty is now    
  being released to the world.  

1043
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:08,314
   And it's gonna be trouble    
       from here on out.        

1044
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:19,190
   - My seven rays of light.
