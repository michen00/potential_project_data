00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,468
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:03,469
Hey, get it, gurl.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,137
Form your own New Wave bands.

4
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,973
Totally tubular.

5
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,041
Our costumes
should be cardboard cutout

6
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,377
geometric shapes.

7
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,445
Yeah, no.

8
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,146
All T, no shapes.

9
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,715
Hot and saucy! 

10
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:17,917
Eww.

11
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,453
 Rectangle girls
of the world 

12
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,889
 I'm every girl,
in a circle I run 

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,290
Well...

14
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,158
In terms of the outfits
in your group,

15
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,460
were you in charge of that?

16
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:28,861
It was a group challenge.

17
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,263
Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.

18
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:31,731
The thing
Thorgy had on her head.

19
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,832
That's what I wanted to wear.

20
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,000
Sorry, girl.

21
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,001
I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.

22
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,136
Nobody puts Derrick
in a box.

23
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,538
Condragulations.

24
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,739
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

25
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,541
Yes!
Snatched it.

26
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,875
Chi Chi DeVayne.

27
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,144
Shantay, you stay.

28
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,880
Naysha Lopez.
Sashay, away.

29
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,283
And there she goes again.

30
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:56,972
Ugh.

31
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,842
Ooh, Chi Chi.
Oh, Lord.

32
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:01,310
How do you feel, Chi Chi?

33
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,346
Tonight there was a lot
of drama on the runway.

34
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:06,148
I ain't gonna be
in no bottom again.

35
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,683
I apologize, Derrick.

36
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,619
If I'm feelin' some kind of way,
I completely shut down.

37
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,489
Mm-hmm.
And I have to change that.

38
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,758
I mean, it's just me being
a bitch. I'm sorry.

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,195
Well, at least she's
an apologetic bitch.

40
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,332
Well, this is my second week
in the bottom three.

41
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,134
I am so happy to still be here.

42
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:27,737
I was in shock
that it was not you lip-syncing.

43
00:01:27,738 --> 00:01:29,171
It was Naysha.

44
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,374
But Chris and Debbie
thought I stood out.

45
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,043
Chris was like, "I think
you could impersonate Debbie.

46
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:35,478
And we'll take you out on tour."

47
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,080
They may have been on drugs.
I want a drug test.

48
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,682
Yeah,
I didn't hear you get that.

49
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,217
But--
I did get told

50
00:01:41,218 --> 00:01:42,718
that my performance
was phenomenal.

51
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,286
Which you didn't get told.

52
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:45,621
All right.

53
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:46,722
Derrick, I think
you just missed the point,

54
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,124
but it's not a big deal.
Okay.

55
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,625
Well, I don't know
if there was a point.

56
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:52,261
It's just Bob talking
is your point all the time.

57
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:54,029
But you'll do, like,
side shady comments,

58
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,498
and it's funny,
but when I do side shady

59
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,899
comments, it's like, over.
No. No, but what you--

60
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,801
Anyone else see this?
Am I on Lonely Island?

61
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,569
Am I on Staten Island or am I
living in Manhattan right now?

62
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,670
You're right.
Thank you.

63
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,406
Ooh,
she got a attitude.

64
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:04,673
I don't see that I do that.

65
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:05,708
I can't wait
till you do it again.

66
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,176
It'll be, like, five minutes.

67
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:09,545
This kind of shade
we haven't seen in a long time.

68
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,646
Damn.

69
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:11,781
The two of you, honey.

70
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,783
That is a pot boiling.

71
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,284
Derrick's, like,
"I ain't never

72
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,387
make jokes about anyone ever."

73
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,790
Hey, Bob.

74
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,725
If I want to do
ratchet drag next week,

75
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,126
can you give me any tips?

76
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,594
Ooh hoo hoo!

77
00:02:25,595 --> 00:02:27,530
If you want to do, like,
memorable drag next week,

78
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,298
I can give you some tips.

79
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,300
So all I need to do
is not wear a wig

80
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,802
and I'll be told by
the judges that I'm pretty.

81
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:35,037
Babe.
Didn't I remind you guys?

82
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,539
I said, "In about five minutes,

83
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,307
she'd make a shady comment
out of nowhere"?

84
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:39,809
And I did.

85
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,310
What I said wasn't meant
to hurt your feelings.

86
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,645
You're trying to be spiteful.
You see the difference?

87
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,113
Your intentions
weren't to hurt me?

88
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,381
No, they weren't to hurt.
If I wanted to hurt you,

89
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,482
you'd be cryin'
right now, bitch.

90
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:49,785
I will never cry
over you at all.

91
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:52,021
Don't give me a challenge.

92
00:02:52,022 --> 00:02:55,057
I work on the strip with
really big drag personalities.

93
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,626
So if you think
you're gonna come for me,

94
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:58,894
I am not that innocent.

95
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,266
I'm glad they revved up,

96
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,168
because the games
have just begun.

97
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,703
Yes, honey,
'cause tonight

98
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,272
it's the Snatch Game,
supermodel edition.

99
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,675
<i>$100,000.</i>

100
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:15,111
<i>With extra special</i>
<i>guest supermodels</i>

101
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,746
<i>Chanel Iman</i>

102
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,581
<i>and Gigi Hadid!</i>

103
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:19,749
How do I look?

104
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,984
Looking good,
feeling snatched.

105
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:31,127
We're Les Chicken Wings.

106
00:03:32,996 --> 00:03:34,730
You know what I love
about this process?

107
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:36,832
I'm becoming, like,
a morning person.

108
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,868
I'm up at, like, 6:00,
and I'm like, "It's 6:00!"

109
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,202
Rise and shine, honey.

110
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:41,203
All day person.

111
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,471
Yeah.
You're like,

112
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,672
"It's mornin', evenin',
and night!

113
00:03:43,673 --> 00:03:44,673
Yeah!
Yeah!"

114
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,042
Whoo!

115
00:03:46,043 --> 00:03:47,309
I'm boisterous.

116
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,311
<i>I'm excited to be here.</i>

117
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,047
I'm on my favorite
fucking TV show.

118
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,748
<i>And that bothers some people.</i>

119
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,784
Sorry, girl.
Sorry, not sorry.

120
00:03:54,785 --> 00:03:56,318
<i>Whoo, girl.</i>

121
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,021
<i>She done already</i>
<i>done had herses.</i>

122
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:01,290
Carol Channing, Brittany G.
Whoo!

123
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:03,959
On a game show
with a bunch of queens.

124
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,628
Judge Judy, Maggie too...

125
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:06,629
Yes!

126
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,398
Little Richard, we love you.

127
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,534
Drag queens with an aptitude

128
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:14,036
for thinking fast
and being crude.

129
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:15,705
Don't just stand there.

130
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:16,972
Let's get to it!

131
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,374
Make me laugh.

132
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:19,575
There's nothing to it.

133
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:20,976
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

134
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,978
Okay, that was
a whole bunch of clues

135
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,814
as to what's coming up.

136
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:26,282
Oh, this show is deep.

137
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,051
Wow.

138
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,086
Ladies.

139
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:31,987
For this week's maxi challenge,

140
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,490
we're going to break
out of the studio

141
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,727
as we drive
along the Hollywood freeway

142
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,831
looking for fresh roadkill.

143
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:45,334
Then, back in the workroom,

144
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:48,671
you'll need to transform
the furry little pelts

145
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:51,540
into evening gowns
that scream

146
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,275
"#CritterCouture."

147
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:55,111
Come on!
It'll be fun.

148
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,512
Hell,
who am I kiddin'?

149
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,981
It's time to play
the Snatch Game.

150
00:04:58,982 --> 00:05:00,916
Well, it is season eight.

151
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,952
And with this show,
you never know.

152
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:04,353
So no roadkill?

153
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:06,255
Not even for a mini challenge?

154
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:09,258
Impersonate a celebrity,
fill in the blanks,

155
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,493
and stake your claim

156
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:13,496
as a front-runner
in this competition.

157
00:05:13,497 --> 00:05:16,265
Gentlemen, start your engines.

158
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,535
And may the best woman win.

159
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,473
Who you doin', baby?

160
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:26,075
I was gonna do Nancy Grace.

161
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:29,111
Which is brilliant by the way.
Yeah, I think it's funny.

162
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,679
Because she's so, so funny.
Over the top.

163
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,015
Oh, she's the craziest.
Right.

164
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,584
And just have outrage
at every--everything.

165
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,186
Every corner.

166
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:39,188
I'm impersonating
Nancy Grace, herself,

167
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:41,624
because she seems
like a major bitch,

168
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,792
and I can relate to that.

169
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:44,427
Not me.

170
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,429
I'm doing Diana Vreeland.
Who?

171
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,763
She was the first
editor in chief

172
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,232
of "Vogue" in the '60s.
Oh.

173
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,634
Do you think
that's a hair obscure?

174
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,402
I love Diana Vreeland.

175
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,371
Fake it.
Look her up.

176
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,706
Months.

177
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,407
Jinkx Monsoon and BenDeLaCreme,

178
00:05:58,408 --> 00:06:00,376
my Seattle sister wives,

179
00:06:00,377 --> 00:06:03,412
won Snatch Game each year
that they were on.

180
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:08,117
So there's a lot
of pressure on me to be great.

181
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,285
What character
are you doing?

182
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,487
Well, I was going
to do Whoopi Goldberg.

183
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,656
"The Color Purple" is, like,
one of my favorite movies.

184
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,024
And it's so quotable.

185
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,258
Everyone knows
"The Color Purple."

186
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,927
Harpo, who this woman?

187
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,662
Since I found out I was gonna
be on the show.

188
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:23,132
And I cannot wait to be able
to prove that I am a performer.

189
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,735
I'm not just a runway queen.

190
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:26,836
Who are you doing?

191
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,105
I'm torn
between Whoopi Goldberg,

192
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,573
Uzo Aduba,

193
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,174
who is an actress on, um,

194
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,743
"Orange Is The New Black"...
Oh, yeah.

195
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,978
And my last choice
is probably my favorite,

196
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,547
but I look the least like her,
is Carol Channing.

197
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:40,483
Why would you do--well.

198
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,051
<i>I know some folks</i>
<i>are gonna question</i>

199
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,986
why is a 6'2" black man

200
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,421
doing Carol Channing, but it's

201
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:46,822
because I feel a connection
with Carol Channing.

202
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,823
I really do.

203
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,525
Aww, such a nice kid.

204
00:06:49,526 --> 00:06:51,060
Miss Celie?

205
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:52,962
You really do look like
Miss Celie.

206
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,697
I sure is ugly.

207
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:57,033
I want to show you how much
I look like Whoopi Goldberg.

208
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:59,435
So Bob basically has,
like, ten characters

209
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:01,504
that he could possibly do.

210
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,606
All the sudden, he's got
the "Sister Act" outfit on.

211
00:07:03,607 --> 00:07:06,242
He is, like, really giving
that Whoopi look.

212
00:07:06,243 --> 00:07:07,543
I think that if you hit a man,

213
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:08,878
a man has the right
to knock you out.

214
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,679
You don't want
to get hit by a man,

215
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,248
don't go around hittin' people.
That's all I'm sayin'.

216
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:15,351
Sister Mary Clarence
never said that.

217
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,253
I'm realizing,
"Oh, shit.

218
00:07:17,254 --> 00:07:19,055
I might be out
of my league here."

219
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:22,024
So I'm gonna have to go
with my plan B backup.

220
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,126
Aww.
Whoopi.

221
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,594
Excited for Snatch Game,

222
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,597
that he's changed
his character, like, 90 times.

223
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:29,965
I think these
are the moves

224
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,002
you got to do
to be Uzo Aduba.

225
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,470
But the brightest bulbs

226
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:37,374
have a way of dimming suddenly
or just going out.

227
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:40,276
<i>Coming up...</i>

228
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:41,677
You've got to stay in character,

229
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,280
and you've got to make me laugh.

230
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,282
Hello, RuPaul.
I am here.

231
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:50,519
My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.

232
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Yeah.

233
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:52,588
Ouch.

234
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,889
Be right back.

235
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:56,234
Welcome back.

236
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,138
Today's challenge--
Ding! Ding! Ding!

237
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,074
Is gonna be Snatch Game.

238
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:03,475
<i>It's a celebrity impersonation,</i>

239
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:05,277
<i>so you have</i>
<i>to make people laugh.</i>

240
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,578
So I'm gonna be busier

241
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:08,814
than a one-legged cat
in a sandbox.

242
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:11,583
Me-ow!

243
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,118
Hey, celebrities.

244
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:15,120
Hey!

245
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,556
Are you ready
to snatch my attention?

246
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,960
Hi, Chi Chi.
Mama Ru.

247
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:23,662
Who are you doing?

248
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,464
I'm doin' Eartha Kitt.
Uh-huh.

249
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:27,699
How are you gonna make
Eartha funny?

250
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,937
Um, I know
that she played Catwoman

251
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:34,239
and I have two cats at home.

252
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,340
Winner!

253
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:36,975
Well, that--there it is!

254
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:39,578
You've got two cats at home.

255
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:42,948
To play Snatch Game,
you've got to stay in character,

256
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:45,250
and you've got to make me laugh.

257
00:08:45,251 --> 00:08:47,018
Yeah.
All right. See you out there.

258
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:48,787
All right.
Thank you.

259
00:08:48,788 --> 00:08:50,322
Hi, Kim Chi.

260
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:52,691
Have you decided on what
character you're gonna portray?

261
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:54,726
Um, there's two characters
I'm debating between.

262
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:58,630
First one is...Pearl.

263
00:08:58,631 --> 00:09:01,067
I bet you didn't
see that one coming.

264
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,003
Is there something on my face?

265
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:08,273
Okay, she might have just
won this one already.

266
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:09,608
I started doing drag
with Pearl,

267
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:11,276
<i>who was on season 7,</i>

268
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:13,378
<i>so I know her quirks</i>
<i>really well.</i>

269
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:14,413
Right. Right.

270
00:09:14,414 --> 00:09:15,580
And who's your
other character?

271
00:09:15,581 --> 00:09:17,049
The other one
is kind of obscure.

272
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,751
Uh-huh.
Kimmy Jong-un, maybe.

273
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:21,586
Who?

274
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:23,188
Kimmy?
Kimmy, yeah.

275
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,123
Kimmy Jong-un is a huge risk,

276
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:27,292
but if I turn
the North Korean dictator

277
00:09:27,293 --> 00:09:29,594
into a drag version of him,
it would be a chance

278
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>for me to show</i>
<i>another side of Kim Chi</i>

279
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,898
that's a little fucked up.

280
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,833
I like
where this is going.

281
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:38,503
So a villainous evil dictator
or Pearl?

282
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:40,605
Kimmy Jong-what?

283
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:43,008
<i>A made-up character,</i>
<i>my friend.</i>

284
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:44,710
I really hope that
lands her in the bottom.

285
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:45,911
Mean, girl.

286
00:09:45,912 --> 00:09:48,113
 Hey, Derrick
 Hey, Ru

287
00:09:48,114 --> 00:09:49,448
Are you gonna do Britney?

288
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:51,650
It's an obvious choice.

289
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:53,885
But this is my chance
to show everyone

290
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,253
that I'm more than

291
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:57,055
just a Britney impersonator.
Uh-huh.

292
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:58,523
And so
I think I'm gonna go

293
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,559
with Laura Bell Bundy's
character.

294
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,594
Yes,
she's the country singer

295
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:04,062
Broadway star.
Right.

296
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,597
And she made up

297
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:07,365
all these characters,
and Shocantelle

298
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,034
is my favorite one.
Uh-huh.

299
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:11,503
She is a black girl
trapped in a white girl's body.

300
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:12,871
Girl, what?

301
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,005
Can I see a little bit

302
00:10:14,006 --> 00:10:17,509
of your Laura Bell Bundy
character?

303
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,411
Hello, RuPaul.
I am here.

304
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,281
My Shocantelle you
that I do have a penis.

305
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,651
You know, sometimes
the most obvious thing

306
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:28,387
is the thing to do.

307
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,722
You just have to decide
where you want to go.

308
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:33,125
Stakes are high.
There's $100,000 on the line.

309
00:10:33,126 --> 00:10:34,426
Yeah, that's true.

310
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,094
All right, Derrick.
Thank you, Ru.

311
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:37,295
Bye.
Bye.

312
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,765
I really should have
become a diplomat.

313
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,333
You're welcome.

314
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:43,201
Thorgy Thor.
That's me.

315
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:44,302
Wait a minute, let me see.

316
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:45,470
I'm getting, uh,

317
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:47,873
Charles Manson.
No.

318
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:51,543
No?
Uh, I'm doing Michael Jackson.

319
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,945
How are you gonna make
Michael Jackson funny?

320
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,647
His little quirks.
His little movements

321
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:58,150
that I have down.

322
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:59,384
Yeah.

323
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:00,952
Who's your biggest
competition here?

324
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,387
You know, I'm gonna say Bob.

325
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,990
You know, what you're asking us
to do in this season,

326
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:07,259
Bob is really excelling at,
which is pissing me off.

327
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,460
Officially.

328
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,528
Well, let me tell you this,
Thorgy.

329
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:10,796
And this might help you.

330
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,631
You second-guess
and you take it into your head.

331
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,433
Constantly.
This is an opportunity

332
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:17,002
for you to feel confident
going with your gut

333
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:18,937
and not overthinking things.

334
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:20,272
Yeah.
All right, Thorgy.

335
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:21,339
I'll see you out there.
Okay.

336
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,008
Shamone.
I'm bad.

337
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:24,409
You know it.
Ah-hee!

338
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,911
Gather round.

339
00:11:25,912 --> 00:11:29,681
Tomorrow on the runway,
the category is

340
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,850
"Night of 100 Madonnas."

341
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:34,486
Ahh!
My God!

342
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,922
It's finally happening!

343
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:39,925
Wait to see
what everybody comes up with.

344
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,560
It's gonna be amazing.

345
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:44,896
So express yourself,
'cause it's a celebration.

346
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:46,531
So don't fuck it up.

347
00:11:46,532 --> 00:11:48,066
Holiday.
Bye.

348
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,167
Bye, Ru.

349
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,069
Don't go for second best,
baby.

350
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,070
Oh, look.

351
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:55,874
Welcome to Snatch Game!

352
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,443
Let's meet
our supermodel contestants.

353
00:11:58,444 --> 00:12:02,047
"Vogue" cover girl Chanel Iman.

354
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:03,482
Hey.

355
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:08,253
And "Sports Illustrated"
bombshell Gigi Hadid.

356
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:09,287
Hi, Ru.
Hi, darling.

357
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:10,389
I'm so excited.

358
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,824
Are you ready
to meet our stars?

359
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:14,393
We are.
Yes.

360
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:19,064
First up, the king of pop,
Michael Jackson.

361
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:21,700
That Thorgy is so
off-the-wall.

362
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:23,635
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

363
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:28,573
The king of pop is here.

364
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:32,911
Next, we have the sister
of the supreme leader

365
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:36,515
of North Korea, Kimmy Jong-un.

366
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:37,716
Anyoung haseyo.

367
00:12:39,185 --> 00:12:40,419
Oh, my goodness.

368
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,820
I just know my emails
are gonna get hacked

369
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:43,088
after this show airs.

370
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:44,122
You know what I mean?

371
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:50,028
Next up, television host
and former prosecutor,

372
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:51,063
Nancy Grace is here.

373
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:52,330
Hello, Nancy.
You know,

374
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:54,299
I'm worried about
the children, RuPaul.

375
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,403
There's reefer smokers
influencing them every day.

376
00:12:58,404 --> 00:12:59,671
All right.
All right.

377
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:01,239
Outlook
not so good.

378
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,709
Legendary "Vogue"
fashion editor,

379
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,943
Diana Vreeland.

380
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:05,944
RuPaul!

381
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,080
What's in this season, Diana?

382
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,316
How the hell should I know?

383
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:14,119
Up next, reality superstar,

384
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,288
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

385
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,491
New York is in
the mutha-fucking house.

386
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:23,462
Up next,
Eartha Kitt is here.

387
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:26,064
How are you?

388
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:27,432
You're not wearing
any panties, are you?

389
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:28,533
Who wears panties?

390
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:29,768
What are those?

391
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,804
You know, I ask myself
the same thing every day.

392
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,773
Britney Jean Spears is here.

393
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:35,974
I don't wear panties either.

394
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:37,309
You don't
wear panties either?

395
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,378
Especially when I get
out of cars.

396
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:42,381
It's funny 'cause it's true.

397
00:13:42,382 --> 00:13:45,283
All right.
From "Orange Is The New Black",

398
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:47,819
Uzo Aduba is here.

399
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,287
Don't say anything stupid.
Don't say anything stupid.

400
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:52,324
Uh, how you doin', RuPaul?

401
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:53,458
Are you ready
to play the game?

402
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,693
I'm excited.

403
00:13:54,694 --> 00:13:55,827
I don't know
why you all gaggin'.

404
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:57,262
She bring it to you
every season.

405
00:13:57,263 --> 00:14:01,066
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, Snatch Game.

406
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,267
<i>Coming up...</i>

407
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,236
I wrote down "weapons
of ass destruction."

408
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,872
Aww, man,
going to commercial already?

409
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:09,341
This snatch
was just getting started.

410
00:14:09,342 --> 00:14:10,642
We'll be right back.

411
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:14,334
All right,
smooth criminals.

412
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:16,537
Time for more M.J.
and more Snatch Game.

413
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,239
Welcome back to Snatch Game.

414
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,874
Here's how the game works.

415
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,544
I ask a question,
and you give an answer

416
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:26,980
that you think will match
our supermodel contestants.

417
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:30,417
First question.
Gigi Hadid.

418
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,387
There's a new dating app
for drag queens.

419
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:34,855
When you join,

420
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:39,159
the first question they ask
is, "How big is your blank?"

421
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,128
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.

422
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:42,663
How big is your wig?

423
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,298
I love that!

424
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,333
Let's go to our superstars

425
00:14:46,334 --> 00:14:48,035
and find out
if you got any matches.

426
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:49,036
Okay.

427
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:51,805
Let's start with Kimmy Jong-un

428
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,173
from North Korea.

429
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:56,310
The first question
they ask is, "How big is your"?

430
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:58,479
I wrote down
weapons of ass destruction.

431
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,714
Weapons of ass destruction.

432
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:05,185
A lady never tells.

433
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:08,188
Well, thank you,
the unbreakable Kimmy Jong-un.

434
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:10,924
Ms. Eartha Kitt.

435
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:14,061
Well, I'm sorry, Gigi...

436
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:18,899
But I said,
"Big furry balls."

437
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,968
How big is your big
furry balls?

438
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:23,704
Honey, get your mind
out of the gutter.

439
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,938
Of course.

440
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,107
Hey, Eartha Kitty, girl.

441
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:29,576
Prosecutor Nancy Grace.

442
00:15:29,577 --> 00:15:33,180
Well, as everybody knows,
not only do I do newscasting,

443
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:36,050
but I also was on another show
where I danced.

444
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,152
So I said, "How big
are your bunions?"

445
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,520
What do you do for bunions?

446
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,321
Well, I was told
you can get 'em shaved off.

447
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:42,823
That's what they do.
I'm about to get that done.

448
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:44,391
Eww.

449
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:45,426
All right.
Sorry, Gigi.

450
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:47,294
Not a match.

451
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:49,897
Let's move on to
Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

452
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:52,399
How big is your clock?

453
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,703
Because drag queens
love a big-ass clock, right?

454
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,474
Ru seems to be throwing Naomi
every bone she can find.

455
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:04,812
Do you like a big clock,
yourself?

456
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,914
But this dog won't catch.

457
00:16:06,915 --> 00:16:08,215
Chanel Iman.

458
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:09,883
It's your turn now, darling.

459
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:13,253
The big bad wolf
is a drag queen.

460
00:16:13,254 --> 00:16:15,155
Instead of huffing,
and puffing,

461
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:16,490
and blowing,

462
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:19,159
she blanks the house down.

463
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,260
Shakes?

464
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:22,096
She gonna shake
the house down.

465
00:16:22,097 --> 00:16:23,564
Shake it but don't break it,
Mama.

466
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,932
Mm.

467
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:26,266
All right, well,
let's go to our celebrities

468
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:28,035
and find out
if you've got a match.

469
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:30,304
Let's start
with Latoya's brother,

470
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:31,505
Michael Jackson.

471
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:32,973
I just said,
"Takes a long nap

472
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:35,075
in a bed
with everyone they know."

473
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,511
Michael, that's crazy.
Thank you.

474
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,081
Mm-hmm.

475
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,117
Let's move on
down to Diana Vreeland.

476
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:45,519
I used to work
for "Vogue" magazine.

477
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,055
But I heard that now
"Vogue" means a dance.

478
00:16:48,056 --> 00:16:51,091
So I think they vogue
the house down.

479
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,559
Okay, that could have been
cute.

480
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,995
Snatch Game's all about
delivering and committing.

481
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:55,963
Come on!

482
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,798
As Jinkx and Dela?

483
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,867
Ooh, girl.
Them girls is gonna--

484
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,368
I was about to say
they gonna hang you,

485
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,369
but I ain't gonna say that.

486
00:17:04,072 --> 00:17:05,973
Eartha Kitt.

487
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,342
Instead of huffing, puffing
and blowing,

488
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:10,144
she blanks the house down.

489
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,046
She licks the house.

490
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,381
Ooh.
Licks the house down.

491
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:17,851
And speaking of lick,
it's time for my bath.

492
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:18,852
What?
Oh, you--

493
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,255
Okay.

494
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:25,993
Ha, ha.
That's what cats do.

495
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,294
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

496
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,830
Eartha Kitt
didn't do that, Chi Chi.

497
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,732
You don't know her life.

498
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,000
Down to Britney Jean.

499
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:35,102
She reads the house down.

500
00:17:35,103 --> 00:17:37,271
That's not a match,
unfortunately, Chanel Iman.

501
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:40,074
But has Eartha Kitt
got your tongue?

502
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,508
I've had that tongue before.

503
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,577
You have?
Good girls gone bad.

504
00:17:43,578 --> 00:17:45,512
Yeah.

505
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,281
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,649
You should do
that one more time.

507
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,085
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

508
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:53,187
I would be very
popular in prison.

509
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,289
I believe her.

510
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,324
All right.
Crazy Eyes.

511
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:00,661
Because you pretty,
I just wrote a poem...

512
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,296
Yeah.
To Iman.

513
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:05,099
A-Once a queen named Iman

514
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,136
remind me of the Sun.

515
00:18:09,137 --> 00:18:12,339
Instead of her
supermodel life,

516
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,742
She can be...

517
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:15,809
my wife.

518
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:19,446
Okay, I don't know
if Bob's winning,

519
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,815
but I think she just got a date
with Chanel Iman.

520
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:22,850
Next question.

521
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,752
Let's go to Gigi Hadid.

522
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:28,088
Lady Bunny has an unusual way
of celebrating gay pride.

523
00:18:28,089 --> 00:18:30,691
Instead of the rainbow flag,

524
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,961
she hangs her blank
out the window.

525
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,262
Her tucking panties.

526
00:18:35,263 --> 00:18:36,864
That's what I wrote.

527
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,465
Let's go to the king
of pop and hear

528
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:40,501
if you have a match.

529
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:41,869
Oh, Ru.
It's not a match,

530
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,071
but I said, "She waves
her blanket."

531
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,672
Say "Hi."
Oh, hi, Blanket.

532
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:47,608
Hi, Blanket.
Hi, hi. Bye-bye.

533
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:49,376
Oh, please be careful.
You don't want Blanket to fall.

534
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:50,377
No.
Oh, thank you.

535
00:18:50,378 --> 00:18:51,378
Yes.

536
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:56,350
Moving on down
to Tiffany "New York" Pollard.

537
00:18:56,351 --> 00:19:00,654
When I think of Pride,
I think of...my hair.

538
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,991
So I said $800 weave?

539
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:05,759
That's an $800 weave?

540
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,361
Well, of course.
Blended.

541
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:08,962
Yes.
Yes.

542
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,263
<i>Naomi's "New York"?</i>

543
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,400
 Wuh-wah

544
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,070
I'm sorry, Gigi.

545
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,504
You didn't get
a match this time.

546
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:18,605
Maybe next time.

547
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,708
Well, look who's here.

548
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,110
I'm sorry
that I'm late.

549
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:26,814
But, uh, Uzo Abu-boo
left the stage

550
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,649
and she asked me
if I would fill in.

551
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,883
Hello, darling.

552
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:30,951
Carol Channing.

553
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,352
Oh, thank you.

554
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:35,723
All right.
Chanel Iman.

555
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,891
Sally the Supermodel

556
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:41,028
is so lactose intolerant,

557
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,832
when the photographer
says, "cheese," she blanks.

558
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,834
Sneezes.
She sneezes!

559
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:47,901
It could happen.

560
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,837
Go down to Nancy Grace.

561
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,273
She sends out an Amber Alert.

562
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,276
Nancy Grace is terrible.

563
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,644
It's important
to keep the children

564
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:58,879
safe from the boozers

565
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,449
and the users
and the reefer smokers.

566
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:04,051
<i>It's lifeless.</i>

567
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:06,587
It's basically Acid Betty
turned into Boring Betty.

568
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,821
Flaccid Betty?

569
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:09,523
Let's move on down
to Britney Spears,

570
00:20:09,524 --> 00:20:10,991
the princess of pop.

571
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,025
She, "Oops.

572
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:13,093
I did it again."

573
00:20:13,094 --> 00:20:14,628
Ahh.

574
00:20:14,629 --> 00:20:16,096
Do you mean
between me down there?

575
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:17,564
She had diarrhea.

576
00:20:20,402 --> 00:20:22,269
All right,
let's move on to Diana Vreeland.

577
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,471
I've worked with Sally
for so long.

578
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:26,573
She pops a pill, RuPaul.

579
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,475
She pops a pill.

580
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,677
There is so much talk
about drugs.

581
00:20:30,678 --> 00:20:32,079
I have-haven't taken
anything but Lipitor

582
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,148
for the past ten years.

583
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,050
You don't really
get a buzz off of that.

584
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:38,252
Now, is there an anal option?

585
00:20:38,253 --> 00:20:40,888
I might happen to have a Fleet
or two in my home.

586
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,389
A Fleet enema.

587
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,724
Now you're talkin'
my language.

588
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:45,692
If you stay ready,
you ain't got to get ready.

589
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:46,827
What she said.

590
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,995
Eartha,

591
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,431
I didn't know
that was you down there.

592
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,965
It's me, darling.
From here,

593
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:55,035
I couldn't tell if you were
Della Reese or Luther Vandross.

594
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,670
I couldn't see.

595
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,406
These aren't even
my good glasses.

596
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,508
But back to
the matter at hand.

597
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:03,277
I just wrote "corn".

598
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:06,013
That's always a good answer.
You know, there's no dairy.

599
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,049
And it comes out the way
you put it in, RuPaul.

600
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,284
I don't remember having corn.

601
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,519
Well, listen.
On that note, I am sorry, folks,

602
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,354
but we are well out of time.

603
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,590
It was a really
close game,

604
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:18,025
but the winner is...

605
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:21,228
Charo!

606
00:21:22,831 --> 00:21:23,897
Charo, what?

607
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:25,099
We all win!

608
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:29,136
I win!
You won!

609
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:30,371
She won!

610
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:36,243
Mwah!

611
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:37,411
<i>Coming up...</i>

612
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:39,613
You were so good.
Amazing.

613
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:40,881
Happy judges?

614
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,783
I know you don't
want to miss this.

615
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,017
Yass!

616
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:45,653
We'll be right back.

617
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:48,501
Get into the groove.

618
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:51,738
Madonna runway
coming right up.

619
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:53,239
What?
I can't believe she--

620
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:56,843
Always the purse.

621
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,277
<i>It's elimination day,</i>

622
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,246
and it is the
Night of the 100 Madonnas.

623
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:01,881
This is the runway
I've been waiting for

624
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:03,449
since this show began!

625
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,985
If you know me, you know my
Madonna is everything.

626
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:07,787
Great minds think alike?

627
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:09,757
Kimono
they better do.

628
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,992
In New York, it's funny.
It's like we're always put

629
00:22:12,993 --> 00:22:15,762
in these boxes of, like,
what people's expectations

630
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,063
of who we are as, you know,

631
00:22:17,064 --> 00:22:18,564
drag artists?
Yes.

632
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:21,401
Now, even people
are putting Brooklyn in a box.

633
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:23,670
Brooklyn doesn't accept me.

634
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,838
<i>I think there's a lot</i>
<i>of queens at home</i>

635
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,507
<i>who do not interact with me.</i>

636
00:22:27,508 --> 00:22:29,342
It sucks that none of them
ask me to be a part

637
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:31,411
of their community.

638
00:22:31,412 --> 00:22:34,480
So I don't fit in anywhere.

639
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,849
There are certain definitions
of "drag."

640
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,685
You know, and there's,

641
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,353
like, "I'm put in it 'cause
I'm the 'look queen.'"

642
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:41,788
I've had fights
with those people

643
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:42,955
where they're like, "Oh,
you're not a drag queen.

644
00:22:42,956 --> 00:22:44,524
You just do looks."
Yes. Mm-hmm.

645
00:22:44,525 --> 00:22:47,660
<i>It hurts me, actually,</i>
<i>that I'm a lone soldier.</i>

646
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:49,562
And I think
that's that huge wall

647
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:52,899
that I put in between me
and myself and everybody else.

648
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,701
I think this show's
a great platform, though,

649
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:56,169
because it kind of shows

650
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,737
that we do something more
than just stand around

651
00:22:57,738 --> 00:22:59,205
and serve booze.
Yup.

652
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,406
You know, or sit around
and be a bitch.

653
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:01,574
Yeah.

654
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:02,909
You know,
I do all these shows.

655
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,444
I make all these things.
But I'm also a musician.

656
00:23:04,445 --> 00:23:07,347
What I really want to do is,
like, do a grand,

657
00:23:07,348 --> 00:23:09,282
like, event,
like, "Thorgy

658
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:10,616
and the Thorchestra."
Fabulous.

659
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:12,218
Like, a 40-piece orchestra,

660
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:14,887
and I want to conduct in drag.

661
00:23:14,888 --> 00:23:17,457
<i>I am a professional violinist,</i>
<i>violist, cellist.</i>

662
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,292
<i>You know, I've played</i>
<i>at Carnegie Hall many times.</i>

663
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:20,727
<i>I feel like I'm</i>
<i>the perfect medium</i>

664
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:22,328
<i>to kind of appeal to, like,</i>
<i>the younger generation</i>

665
00:23:22,329 --> 00:23:24,831
and make Classical music cool.

666
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,766
It's a throwback to, like,
events where, like,

667
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,868
you dressed up just to get
on the red carpet.

668
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:30,670
I love that.

669
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,338
Do you have any siblings, Bob?

670
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:34,140
I have two brothers, actually.

671
00:23:34,141 --> 00:23:35,775
Uh-huh.
How many do you have?

672
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:38,344
I have eight brothers
and three sisters.

673
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:39,345
Damn, Gina.

674
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:40,480
Crazy.

675
00:23:40,481 --> 00:23:42,048
You said you were adopted?
Yeah.

676
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:43,716
Did they have a talk where
they were, like, "You know--"

677
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:45,518
Where they went, like, one day,
like, "Well, just so you know."

678
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,853
Well,
it's--like it's very obvious

679
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:48,354
that I'm adopted.
These are my parents.

680
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:50,056
So growing up
with white parents.

681
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:51,290
A rainbow family.

682
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,559
Like, this is my mom.
She's gorgeous.

683
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,094
Yeah, she's, like,
the best mom ever.

684
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:57,730
I'm literally the only gay one
in my family.

685
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:01,267
And I have
a Christian background,

686
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:03,269
<i>and I've heard stories of kids</i>

687
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,171
<i>being shunned from the family</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

688
00:24:05,172 --> 00:24:08,274
And my mom has done nothing
but make me feel accepted.

689
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:10,209
And, she's just
an amazing woman.

690
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,310
I love my mom.

691
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,179
Big love
to Mama Smalls.

692
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,415
The best parents
and best childhood.

693
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,451
Did you ever feel a--a need
to just study up on black stuff?

694
00:24:18,452 --> 00:24:20,286
Kind of.
It wasn't a weird thing

695
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:22,355
until I got to high school,
middle school.

696
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,257
People were throwing out
all these, like,

697
00:24:24,258 --> 00:24:26,726
black references.
And I was, like, "Wait.

698
00:24:26,727 --> 00:24:28,594
What does that mean?"
Did you grow up with,

699
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:30,463
like, black culture
was, like, second-hand?

700
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,432
I grew up
in an all-black family.

701
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,367
I went to all-black high school,
all-black elementary school

702
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,302
and a majority
black middle school.

703
00:24:36,303 --> 00:24:38,304
Like, I get called "Oreo,"
like, all the time.

704
00:24:38,305 --> 00:24:40,106
It's obnoxious.
Or, like, "Oh,

705
00:24:40,107 --> 00:24:41,741
he's kind of cute
for a black guy."

706
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:43,810
Oh, don't even get me started
on being cute for a black guy.

707
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:45,445
Why it gotta be
black out?

708
00:24:45,446 --> 00:24:47,547
Wait, I think you're kind
of cute for a black guy, Naomi.

709
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:49,248
Thank you, Kimberly Chi.

710
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:50,249
Kind of, though.

711
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:55,755
Oh, my Madonna.

712
00:24:55,756 --> 00:24:57,256
I am so excited
for this runway;

713
00:24:57,257 --> 00:24:58,925
you have no idea.

714
00:24:58,926 --> 00:25:02,962
These queens better bring it
and make Madge proud.

715
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:05,631
<i> Put the bass in your walk </i>

716
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:09,469
<i> Head to toe,</i>
<i>let your whole body talk </i>

717
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,305
<i>And, what?</i>

718
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:16,009
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

719
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,244
The world's biggest Madonna fan,

720
00:25:18,245 --> 00:25:19,812
Bible, girl.
Bible.

721
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,881
You must be my lucky star.

722
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,985
A guy who's game for anything,

723
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:28,187
Carson Kressley.

724
00:25:28,188 --> 00:25:30,590
Now, who would you do
in the Snatch Game?

725
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:33,326
I would impersonate, um,
like, maybe a man.

726
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:34,994
Like, Michelle Visage.

727
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:37,964
You need to get more butch,
baby.

728
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:40,166
The gorgeous Gigi Hadid.

729
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,603
Now, is it more fun to hang out
with models or drag queens?

730
00:25:43,604 --> 00:25:45,605
Well, I've never had
this much fun at a runway show,

731
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:47,373
so, drag queens, of course.

732
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:49,442
Oh, yes,
she better Hadid.

733
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:51,377
Stunning Chanel Iman.

734
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:53,112
Did you have a good time
yesterday?

735
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:54,113
Yes.

736
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:56,015
It was everything.

737
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:59,852
This week, our queens
channeled showbiz greats,

738
00:25:59,853 --> 00:26:02,722
as they went
for Snatch Game gold.

739
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:05,692
And tonight, my girls
are ready to take a bow,

740
00:26:05,693 --> 00:26:07,560
because bitch!

741
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:08,594
They're Madonna.

742
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:10,596
UnapologeticBitches.

743
00:26:10,597 --> 00:26:11,597
Start your engines.

744
00:26:11,598 --> 00:26:13,833
And may the best woman win.

745
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:17,937
<i> The realness </i>

746
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:19,572
Thorgy Thor.

747
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:21,207
Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Drag Queen.

748
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,843
Nothing really matters.
No, sure doesn't.

749
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,745
<i>As I'm walking down</i>
<i>the runway, I'm giving you,</i>

750
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:27,280
<i>like, angular,</i>

751
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,482
<i>interesting artistic movements,</i>
<i>and I'm feeling it.</i>

752
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:30,783
Undercover geisha.

753
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,586
Okay, that's one kimono.

754
00:26:33,587 --> 00:26:36,255
Up next, Kim Chi.
Oh.

755
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:37,690
Two in a row.

756
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,325
There's another kimono.

757
00:26:39,326 --> 00:26:40,893
<i>Vintage wedding kimono.</i>

758
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:44,263
<i>But I wish I wasn't wearing</i>
<i>the same thing as Thorgy.</i>

759
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:45,765
She's servin'
that walk, Michelle.

760
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,200
She is.

761
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:48,534
W-O-K.

762
00:26:48,535 --> 00:26:50,303
Yeah.

763
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,804
Derrick Barry.

764
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:56,409
What in the name of Lourdes
Maria Ciccone Leon is going on?

765
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,545
<i>Down in</i>
<i>the most original kimono.</i>

766
00:26:59,546 --> 00:27:00,947
<i>It's hand-painted,</i>

767
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,249
<i>and I feel like</i>
<i>this is a standout piece.</i>

768
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,551
Is that sidewalk talk?
Jean Paul Gaultier.

769
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:07,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

770
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:09,088
Naomi Smalls.

771
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:10,289
Okay, was there
a fire sale?

772
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,557
What's going on?

773
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:13,426
These girls
are really hung up on kimonos.

774
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:17,263
Honestly, we had no idea
this was gonna happen.

775
00:27:17,264 --> 00:27:19,365
It's kimono-gate, bitches.

776
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:23,569
<i>Even though three other girls</i>
<i>are in the exact same look.</i>

777
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,204
Kung fu fightin'.
This is, like,

778
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:27,640
the Victoria's
Secret section of Madonna.

779
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,075
I like that material, girl.

780
00:27:31,245 --> 00:27:32,679
Acid Betty.

781
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,447
Thank God.

782
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:36,282
It may have a few holes
in it, but--

783
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:38,885
<i>My Madonna look today</i>

784
00:27:38,886 --> 00:27:40,687
<i>is from "Bedtime Stories,"</i>

785
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:43,589
<i>where she's pregnant,</i>
<i>giving birth to doves.</i>

786
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,258
<i>This outfit</i>
<i>represents who I am,</i>

787
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:46,759
<i>because obviously</i>
<i>I'm</i> the only one

788
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,960
<i>creative enough to think of it.</i>

789
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:49,529
I ain't mad at it.

790
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,530
Thanks, Betty, girl.

791
00:27:50,531 --> 00:27:51,864
Bye, bye, birdie.

792
00:27:51,865 --> 00:27:53,366
Robbie Turnter.

793
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,634
She's in a league of her own.

794
00:27:54,635 --> 00:27:57,670
There's no crying
in baseball, Robbie!

795
00:27:57,671 --> 00:27:58,971
<i>I feel so cute.</i>

796
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,606
<i>I've got my cute little dress.</i>

797
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:03,976
<i>It's all hand-painted</i>
<i>with my little patches.</i>

798
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:06,112
I wonder if she's a pitcher
or a catcher.

799
00:28:06,113 --> 00:28:07,880
Me too.

800
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:09,816
Chi Chi DeVayne.

801
00:28:09,817 --> 00:28:12,151
You're gonna poke somebody's
eyes out with those things.

802
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,186
If you're lucky.

803
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:14,320
<i>When you think of Madonna,</i>

804
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:15,988
<i>you think of the cone bra.</i>

805
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,824
<i>Bitch, I look good.</i>
Oh, yeah.

806
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:20,560
It's--she's totally
expressing herself.

807
00:28:20,561 --> 00:28:22,662
I think she likes
a little hanky-panky.

808
00:28:22,663 --> 00:28:24,163
I'm breathless.

809
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:25,565
Oh!

810
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:28,368
Not to be confused
with Bob the camp counselor.

811
00:28:28,369 --> 00:28:29,469
Aww, Bob's
such a trouper.

812
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,237
<i>My favorite Madonna look</i>

813
00:28:31,238 --> 00:28:33,172
<i>is Madonna at the GLAAD Awards</i>

814
00:28:33,173 --> 00:28:34,807
<i>when she dressed</i>
<i>like a boy scout.</i>

815
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:38,811
<i>And it is a huge</i>
<i>political statement.</i>

816
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:40,580
<i>And I'm not in a kimono!</i>

817
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:42,582
Get a load
of those Girl Scout cookies.

818
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,250
Yes!

819
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:47,286
And she earned a badge
for walking children in nature.

820
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,821
<i> The realness</i>

821
00:28:48,822 --> 00:28:50,390
<i>Coming up...</i>

822
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:52,225
You could have gone
so much bigger with her.

823
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:54,193
You are like
a white Chaka Khan.

824
00:28:54,194 --> 00:28:55,795
So you did Britney.

825
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:57,997
Like a prayer,
we're taking you there,

826
00:28:57,998 --> 00:28:59,298
right after this.

827
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:02,568
Quicker than a ray of light,
we're back.

828
00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:03,970
Welcome, ladies.

829
00:29:03,971 --> 00:29:07,173
When I call your name,
please step forward

830
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:08,207
and strike a pose.

831
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,079
Kim Chi.

832
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,616
Chi Chi DeVayne.

833
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:18,918
You're both safe.

834
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:19,919
Thank you.

835
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,789
You may leave the stage.

836
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,424
Oh, the power of good-bye.

837
00:29:24,425 --> 00:29:26,292
Bye.

838
00:29:26,293 --> 00:29:30,196
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.

839
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:31,731
Tonight
on the runway,

840
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:33,433
I don't know
if you guys had some kind of

841
00:29:33,434 --> 00:29:36,135
symbiotic message
to each other,

842
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:39,405
but there's a lot of kimonos
which is very interesting.

843
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:41,240
Thorgy, you did your take on it.

844
00:29:41,241 --> 00:29:43,843
You kept it in geisha,
but still Thorgy's in there.

845
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:46,712
The Michael Jackson
was so good.

846
00:29:46,713 --> 00:29:47,980
I loved all of it.

847
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:50,383
You kept character
better than anyone.

848
00:29:50,384 --> 00:29:52,218
It was everything for me.

849
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:53,386
It's 'cause she's bad.

850
00:29:53,387 --> 00:29:55,188
She's bad.
You know it.

851
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:56,722
I was not expecting
to see "Bedtime Stories"

852
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:57,824
and the whole
bird-fly-out thing.

853
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:59,725
So kudos to that.
Thank you.

854
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,260
I think your make-up
is okay tonight.

855
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:03,196
It's nothing spectacular.

856
00:30:03,197 --> 00:30:06,632
But where I was really let down,
was in the Snatch Game, Betty.

857
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:07,767
It didn't look like her.

858
00:30:07,768 --> 00:30:09,168
It was like the wig
and the make-up,

859
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,737
you were like
a white Chaka Khan.

860
00:30:10,738 --> 00:30:12,205
I didn't get
any Nancy Grace from it.

861
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,973
It felt like
you were just being you.

862
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:16,642
It was just a fail
all the way around.

863
00:30:16,643 --> 00:30:18,144
Sorry, not sorry.

864
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:19,445
Just keepin' it 100.

865
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:20,747
Woman funny.

866
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:23,216
I needed like a nasal,
angry southern voice.

867
00:30:23,217 --> 00:30:25,017
And then she leans in,

868
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:27,653
and she wants to talk
to you on the TV

869
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,388
like she's in your living room.

870
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,791
I wish I had you as a coach.

871
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:33,626
Whew!
They are savages!

872
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:34,660
Roar!

873
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:35,862
All right.

874
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,396
Up next, Robbie Turnter.

875
00:30:37,397 --> 00:30:39,098
I really enjoyed your catwalk

876
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:41,701
because it was really fun
and playful.

877
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:43,236
I was really excited
about Diana.

878
00:30:43,237 --> 00:30:46,272
And I--I think that most people
may not know who that is.

879
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:48,174
So I think that
how iconic she was,

880
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:50,042
and the voice and everything,
you kind of have to shove

881
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:51,711
that in people's faces
for them to get it.

882
00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:55,348
You could have gone
so much bigger with her.

883
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:57,183
Punk took my voice away.

884
00:30:57,184 --> 00:30:58,818
My voice kept cracking,

885
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,820
and I was going in and out
during Diana Vreeland.

886
00:31:00,821 --> 00:31:02,989
Hey, Michelle.
You buying what she's selling?

887
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,724
Mm.

888
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:06,427
With what was being said.

889
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,029
Up next, Naomi Smalls.

890
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,031
It's becoming quite
predictable

891
00:31:12,032 --> 00:31:15,068
for Naomi to come out
in basically, lingerie.

892
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:17,970
This is where we go, "Oh, maybe
I should switch it up now."

893
00:31:17,971 --> 00:31:20,073
In Snatch Game,
I got lost with the boobs.

894
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:22,341
I think if you would have just
stuffed it to the max,

895
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,977
it would of made the character
a lot more obvious to me.

896
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:26,979
So we didn't love New York.

897
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,281
Sorry.

898
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:30,149
I was very underwhelmed
with my performance.

899
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,451
It was not coming out,

900
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:33,086
and I'm, like,
so embarrassed about it.

901
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:36,722
All right.
Thank you, Naomi.

902
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:39,025
Up next, Derrick Barry.

903
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:41,295
So we did Britney, huh?

904
00:31:45,632 --> 00:31:47,133
I am so grateful.

905
00:31:47,134 --> 00:31:48,234
Oh, God.

906
00:31:48,235 --> 00:31:50,269
You done good, girl.

907
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,738
Me and Gigi really,

908
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,841
really loved your
Britney performance yesterday.

909
00:31:54,842 --> 00:31:56,409
You kept character
the whole time.

910
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,411
You just were Britney.
Thank you so much.

911
00:31:58,412 --> 00:31:59,679
Thank you, Derrick.

912
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,947
Bob The Drag Queen.

913
00:32:00,948 --> 00:32:03,182
Tonight, on the runway.
Love it.

914
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:04,951
I love your Madonna look too.

915
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:07,954
And I know you're
a <i>huge</i> Madonna fan.

916
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,322
And, like, one of
your biggest thing you said,

917
00:32:09,323 --> 00:32:11,090
was when Madonna sent you,
like, a cease and desist?

918
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:12,658
Yes!

919
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:14,460
The truth of the matter is,
her people called my people

920
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:16,329
because I looked a little
too much like her.

921
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,830
She couldn't take it.
Mm-hmm.

922
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:20,066
You are serving "womana."

923
00:32:20,067 --> 00:32:22,001
This old luscious body.

924
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:23,603
The Snatch Game.

925
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:25,805
Uzo Aduba, amazing.

926
00:32:25,806 --> 00:32:27,106
You were so good.

927
00:32:27,107 --> 00:32:29,809
Then, we get a little
Carol Channing.

928
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,979
You gave us extra,
which was wonderful.

929
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,114
I do want to caution you,
however.

930
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:37,283
Sometimes you borderline
on showboating.

931
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:39,685
A drag queen
showboating?

932
00:32:39,686 --> 00:32:41,187
I never!

933
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:42,422
All right, ladies.

934
00:32:42,423 --> 00:32:43,389
Well, I think
we've heard enough.

935
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,425
While you untuck backstage,

936
00:32:45,426 --> 00:32:48,428
the judges and I
will deliberate.

937
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:49,695
All right.

938
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:52,298
Now, just between us
material squirrels.

939
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,000
What do you think?

940
00:32:54,001 --> 00:32:55,368
Thorgy Thor.

941
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:58,171
Her Michael Jackson,
I thought was divine.

942
00:32:58,172 --> 00:33:00,039
She was really good
at making fun of things

943
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
that are a little taboo.

944
00:33:01,241 --> 00:33:03,176
She stayed in character
the entire time.

945
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:05,278
I really felt
like Michael was there.

946
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,314
Acid Betty.
Her runway was very creative.

947
00:33:08,315 --> 00:33:11,751
But her Nancy Grace
was more like Nancy Disgrace.

948
00:33:11,752 --> 00:33:12,952
Ooh, child.

949
00:33:12,953 --> 00:33:13,953
I can be punny.

950
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:15,121
Look out, y'all.

951
00:33:15,122 --> 00:33:16,956
She doesn't even
have the wig right.

952
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:18,758
You need a little
helmet-y blonde.

953
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,827
And then you need a few
little Nancy Grace-isms.

954
00:33:20,828 --> 00:33:22,962
And none of that happened.
It was just like,

955
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:25,098
she didn't even know
who Nancy Grace was.

956
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:26,833
Robbie Turnter.

957
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:29,001
The "League of Their Own" look
stood out from the rest.

958
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:31,971
I would give it a B plus.
We love Diana Vreeland.

959
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:33,740
We do, indeed.

960
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,041
Everything was wrong about it.

961
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:37,076
Why didn't she go
for the blown-back hair?

962
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:38,311
With the--
with the bump at the top.

963
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:39,479
Yes!

964
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,646
The worst part
of the whole thing tonight

965
00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:41,981
with Robbie, was the--

966
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:44,617
"I have no voice."

967
00:33:44,618 --> 00:33:46,352
Somebody just get
a cough drop already.

968
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:47,687
You don't have a voice
anymore?

969
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:49,088
And I think she needs
to get out of her head

970
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:50,623
and get into my car.

971
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:53,326
Okay.
All right, Billy Ocean.

972
00:33:53,327 --> 00:33:55,828
Naomi Smalls
did Tiffany Pollard.

973
00:33:55,829 --> 00:33:57,263
New York.
She didn't do New York.

974
00:33:57,264 --> 00:33:59,065
She did not do New York.
She wasn't New York.

975
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,800
She wasn't Connecticut.
She wasn't New Jersey.

976
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:03,035
She wasn't Long Island.
I don't know what she was.

977
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:05,204
But, Naomi's was my favorite
of the kimonos.

978
00:34:05,205 --> 00:34:07,306
She made me want to wear it,
but I don't know

979
00:34:07,307 --> 00:34:09,609
if it really screamed "Madonna."

980
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,943
Derrick Barry.

981
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:12,111
The Britney blew me away.

982
00:34:12,112 --> 00:34:13,546
I was so excited for every time

983
00:34:13,547 --> 00:34:15,114
that she was going
to answer a question.

984
00:34:15,115 --> 00:34:16,382
The runway thing,

985
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:18,618
I always find her a bit
timid on the runway.

986
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:20,052
When you're on the catwalk,

987
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,288
you've got to just
give it all you got.

988
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:24,056
You know, I once asked Iman

989
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:26,959
what is on her mind
on the runway.

990
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,129
And she looked at me dead
in the eyes and said, "Africa."

991
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:33,633
That's what I do
when I go to bars.

992
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:35,768
Oh, really?
Yes. Think about Africa.

993
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:36,803
Oh-kerr!

994
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:38,137
Oh--

995
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:40,973
Bob The Drag Queen.
She flipped the script.

996
00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:43,776
Come back as an African-American
Carol Channing

997
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:46,646
doing a <i>fabulous</i>
impersonation of her.

998
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:48,181
Right.
And the Madonna thing,

999
00:34:48,182 --> 00:34:49,749
it was the most
well put together

1000
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,184
thought-out costume.

1001
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:53,719
I didn't even know
leg pads were a thing.

1002
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,655
There's a lot goin'
on on the stage

1003
00:34:55,656 --> 00:34:56,989
that would blow your mind, Gigi.

1004
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,691
Uh-huh.
Show-and-tell backstage after?

1005
00:34:58,692 --> 00:34:59,759
Oh, I don't know
if you ready.

1006
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,063
Silence!

1007
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,398
I've made my decision.

1008
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:07,533
Bring back my girls.

1009
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:10,471
More ki ki with Gigi
right after this.

1010
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:14,435
You got the moves, baby,
we be causing a commotion.

1011
00:35:14,436 --> 00:35:15,436
Let's watch.

1012
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:17,839
I've made some decisions.

1013
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,774
Thorgy Thor.

1014
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:22,744
Your Michael Jackson
was off the wall.

1015
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:27,348
And your Madonna look
was something to remember.

1016
00:35:27,349 --> 00:35:28,983
Bob The Drag Queen.

1017
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:32,453
I's was crazy
about your Snatch Game.

1018
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:34,322
And on the runway,

1019
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:36,792
you are one unapologetic bitch.

1020
00:35:41,363 --> 00:35:43,364
Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,

1021
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:44,632
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

1022
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:45,667
Thank you.

1023
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:46,801
Thank you.

1024
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,472
You've won a collection
of handbags and wallets

1025
00:35:51,473 --> 00:35:53,608
from Lux De Ville

1026
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,877
valued at $7,000.

1027
00:35:55,878 --> 00:35:57,478
Now, that's
"purse first," baby.

1028
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,581
Wow.

1029
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,115
Whoo!

1030
00:36:01,116 --> 00:36:03,117
I took a risk, and it paid off.

1031
00:36:03,118 --> 00:36:04,519
Bob and Thorgy,

1032
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,555
you may join the other girls.

1033
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,158
Derrick Barry.

1034
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,159
You are safe.

1035
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,360
Thank you.

1036
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:14,162
Thank you so much.

1037
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:15,563
Acid Betty,

1038
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:19,467
your runway was
an immaculate conception.

1039
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,136
But your Nancy Grace left us
asking,

1040
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:23,539
"Who's that girl?"

1041
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:29,377
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1042
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:31,179
I totally agree
with Snatch Game.

1043
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,014
It sucked.
But I think Snatch Game sucks.

1044
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:35,617
Said no one ever.

1045
00:36:35,618 --> 00:36:37,485
Your runway was a hit.

1046
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:41,757
But your Snatch Game
was a swing and a miss.

1047
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,126
Naomi Smalls,

1048
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:47,562
your runway look was borderline.

1049
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:50,265
But your impersonation
of "New York"

1050
00:36:50,266 --> 00:36:52,400
bordered on "New Jersey."

1051
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:54,970
Hey, why's she gotta bring
New Jersey into this?

1052
00:36:56,772 --> 00:36:58,273
Naomi Smalls.

1053
00:36:58,274 --> 00:37:00,375
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1054
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:03,311
All right, time to go big,
Naomi Smalls.

1055
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:04,312
You are safe.

1056
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:05,613
Thank you.

1057
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:11,486
Two queens stand before me.

1058
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:13,888
As always, I've consulted
with the judges.

1059
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:15,223
But quite frankly,
I don't give a

1060
00:37:15,224 --> 00:37:16,858
fuck what they say.

1061
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,327
Because the final decision
is mine to make.

1062
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:21,229
Um, I'll still be here
just in case you need me.

1063
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,531
This is your last chance

1064
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,899
to impress me

1065
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,537
and save yourself
from elimination.

1066
00:37:30,806 --> 00:37:32,807
The time has come

1067
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:37,478
for you to lip-synch
for your life!

1068
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,881
<i>Life!</i>

1069
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:42,951
I'm not about to go home
to Acid Betty.

1070
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:44,752
<i>I'm gonna bring it,</i>

1071
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:47,121
<i>and I'm gonna do everything</i>
<i>I can to send this bitch home.</i>

1072
00:37:47,122 --> 00:37:49,123
Good luck,

1073
00:37:49,124 --> 00:37:51,326
and don't fuck it up.

1074
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:57,231
<i> I've got the moves, baby </i>

1075
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:59,267
<i> You got the motion </i>

1076
00:37:59,268 --> 00:38:00,702
<i> If we got together </i>

1077
00:38:00,703 --> 00:38:03,404
<i> We'd be causing a commotion </i>

1078
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:07,675
<i> Someday you'll see</i>
<i>my point of view </i>

1079
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,211
<i>I'm pregnant with birds</i>
<i>coming out of my belly,</i>

1080
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:12,547
<i>and now I have to lip-synch</i>
<i>for my life?</i>

1081
00:38:12,548 --> 00:38:14,115
<i>I'm ready to make TV history.</i>

1082
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:16,551
<i> Work for you </i>

1083
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:17,986
<i> You've got to</i>
<i>make the compromise </i>

1084
00:38:17,987 --> 00:38:19,287
<i> And maybe </i>

1085
00:38:19,288 --> 00:38:23,458
<i> Then we can keep</i>
<i>our love alive </i>

1086
00:38:23,459 --> 00:38:27,295
<i> And when it falls,</i>
<i>we won't let it die </i>

1087
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:31,266
<i> It doesn't matter</i>
<i>if you win or lose </i>

1088
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,901
<i> It's how you play the game </i>

1089
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:35,036
<i> So get into the groove </i>

1090
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:36,471
<i>All you hear is music.</i>

1091
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:38,206
<i>You have no idea what's</i>
<i>happening around you.</i>

1092
00:38:38,207 --> 00:38:41,809
<i>And in that moment, you will do</i>
<i>whatever it takes to stay.</i>

1093
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,745
<i> Commotion </i>

1094
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:45,546
<i> I hope you find </i>

1095
00:38:45,547 --> 00:38:48,483
<i> What you're looking for </i>

1096
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:49,684
<i> Is it mine? </i>

1097
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:52,086
<i> Walk through that door </i>

1098
00:38:52,087 --> 00:38:53,888
<i> We're wasting time </i>

1099
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:57,125
<i> Make up your mind </i>

1100
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,494
<i> And get into the groove </i>

1101
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:01,529
<i> I got the moves, baby </i>

1102
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,264
<i> You got the motion </i>

1103
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:04,766
<i> If we got together </i>

1104
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:08,937
<i> We'd be causing a commotion </i>

1105
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:11,539
<i> Causing a commotion </i>

1106
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,207
Oh, she's having it...

1107
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,777
officially.

1108
00:39:15,778 --> 00:39:18,112
Yeah!

1109
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,185
Ladies.

1110
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:25,721
I've made my decision.

1111
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:33,294
Naomi Smalls,

1112
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:35,129
shantay, you stay.

1113
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,430
<i>Oh.</i>

1114
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,670
Acid Betty.

1115
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,608
You've taken us
on one wild trip.

1116
00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:47,942
Thanks for the high.

1117
00:39:47,943 --> 00:39:49,244
Thank you for the opportunity.

1118
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:50,712
It's been amazing.

1119
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:53,314
And I'm so happy to be
a part of royalty now.

1120
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:57,151
Now, sashay away.

1121
00:39:57,152 --> 00:40:01,256
Now, there goes
one unapologetic bitch.

1122
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:04,592
I love you guys.

1123
00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:07,196
Acid Betty out!

1124
00:40:09,598 --> 00:40:11,799
I'm so happy that I came here.

1125
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,235
I would not change this
for anything.

1126
00:40:14,236 --> 00:40:16,304
Legends are born
in "RuPaul's Drag Race".

1127
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,806
And now I'm officially a legend.

1128
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,875
Bitches beware.

1129
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:25,280
'Cause Acid Betty is now
being released to the world.

1130
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:27,549
And it's gonna be trouble
from here on out.

1131
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:33,588
My seven rays of light.

1132
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:36,457
You live to die another day.

1133
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:38,159
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1134
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,461
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

1135
00:40:40,462 --> 00:40:42,063
Can I get an "Amen" in here?

1136
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,131
Amen.

1137
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:45,366
All right.
Now, let the music play.

1138
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:47,235
All right, material squirrels.

1139
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,837
Thanks for watching
our girlie show.

1140
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,740
Next week we're off
to see the wizard.

1141
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,576
I got you, Dorothy.

1142
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,678
Deuces!
