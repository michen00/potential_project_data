1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,303
Oh, my God,
season 8.

2
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,505
Let's go.

3
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:09,776
I am Naomi Smalls,
and I am 21 years old.

4
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,446
Check your lipstick
before you come for me.

5
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:15,349
Naomi is a tall glass of water.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,751
She has legs all the way up
to her asshole.

7
00:00:17,752 --> 00:00:19,419
Language!

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,155
From Naomi Campbell
and Biggie Smalls.

9
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:24,558
First one,
I don't blame them.

10
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,727
I'm obsessed
with '90s supermodels.

11
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:30,364
I'm gonna set myself
right in the center.

12
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,033
Yeah, spotlight on me.

13
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,170
Naomi is a fashion girl.
She's fucking fierce.

14
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,437
We'll see.

15
00:00:39,474 --> 00:00:43,177
How you doing mis amores?
Do you want to see my cuckoo?

16
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:46,280
Honey, your cuckoo
is the first thing we noticed.

17
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:47,848
How are you?

18
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:51,185
I'm from Puerto Rico, but
I live in Austin, Texas, y'all.

19
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:53,720
I call myself between
pageant queen and performer

20
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:57,024
'cause I do comedy,
I do campy sometimes.

21
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:58,525
Sometimes?

22
00:00:58,526 --> 00:00:59,893
You know.

23
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,663
I'm sexy as a goddess is
and funny as a clown.

24
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,164
Are you ready for me?

25
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,266
Oh, my God,
the room is huge.

26
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,969
Fantastic,
so my cuckoo have a space.

27
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,070
I need a space--

28
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,605
Watch out,
new thunder effects.

29
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:14,808
What's up, nerds.

30
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,343
Ah!

31
00:01:16,344 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>My name is</i>
<i>Dax ExclamationPoint,</i>

32
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,080
and I am the queen
of all nerds.

33
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,715
It's Storm.

34
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:24,117
<i>I'm a cosplayer, and my look</i>
<i>is very inspired by,</i>

35
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,419
<i>like, science fiction</i>
<i>and comics.</i>

36
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,354
Superheroes.
Just strong, bad bitches

37
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,356
who don't take any crap
from anybody else.

38
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:31,158
You do you, girl.

39
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,793
So I'm just gonna sit
right here.

40
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,528
Okay.
Can I get some brunch?

41
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,363
Country breakfast is ready.

42
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:37,664
Hola.

43
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,868
The beauty is here.

44
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,669
<i>My name is Naysha Lopez.</i>

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,171
Can we call her NayLo?

46
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:47,941
Element of my drag
has to be appearance.

47
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:51,411
<i>It sounds so shallow,</i>
<i>but my drag is flawless.</i>

48
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:52,646
<i>It's gorgeous.</i>
<i>It's stunning.</i>

49
00:01:52,647 --> 00:01:54,681
It's gorgeous.
It's everything.

50
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,884
Did I say it was stunning
and gorgeous?

51
00:01:56,885 --> 00:01:57,951
Did I say that already?
Okay.

52
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,320
That lady repeats herself.

53
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,624
Naysha is here!
Yes, my sister!

54
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,292
Whoo!
Continental sisters.

55
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,860
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,762
So you're Puerto Rico also,
or from Austin?

57
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:10,197
I'm originally
from Puerto Rico,

58
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,365
but, um, I live in Chicago.

59
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,769
That's a little frog
in Puerto Rico.

60
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,937
They are so annoying.

61
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,740
Why is she squirping
like a chirper?

62
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:21,275
You don't even understand
what she's saying,

63
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,277
but you don't really care.

64
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,716
Shantay, she sprays.

65
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:33,554
No need to adjust
your TV sets.

66
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:37,591
This acid trip is all real.

67
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,360
Watch out, bitches.

68
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,497
Here's Acid Betty, and I am from
Brooklyn, New York.

69
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:45,632
<i>My drag style is completely</i>
<i>over-the-top.</i>

70
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,168
Basically, a drug trip
without the drugs.

71
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,470
I kind of want to run around.

72
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,806
The main bullet point
of Acid Betty is she's a bitch.

73
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:53,941
That's it.

74
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,809
Even Bianca
won't fuck with her.

75
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,845
That's the T.

76
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,314
Wait, I want to put my stink
all over this place.

77
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,349
I'm excited to be here.

78
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,053
Come on, like,
before we all hate each other.

79
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,821
Everybody say love?

80
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,124
Good morning.

81
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:14,361
I didn't realize
this was happening today.

82
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,762
<i>My name is Robbie Turner,</i>

83
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:18,832

you'll ever meet.

00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,301
<i>I'm trying to give</i>

86
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:25,873
Gorgeous.

87
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:28,509
Yes, Turnter Classic Movies.

88
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,676
14 years of drag?

89
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,212
I know, can you imagine?
I'm only 12.

90
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,914
You don't look old.

91
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:37,084
I know I don't.

92
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:40,087
Yes!
Oh!

93
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:42,756
Yay!
Oh, Kim Chi!

94
00:03:42,757 --> 00:03:45,125
I came to chop
suey the competition.

95
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,260
<i>My name is Kim Chi,</i>

96
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:49,129

She's ani-major.

101
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,105
Hi, I'm Naomi.
This is beautiful.

102
00:03:58,106 --> 00:03:59,606
<i>Seeing Kim Chi on Instagram</i>

103
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,409
for so long,
double-tapping everything,

104
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,044
I'm fucking starstruck.

105
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,446
I want to go subtle
with everything, so...

106
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,550
<i>I may come across as shy</i>
<i>because I'm soft-spoken,</i>

00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,589
donut come for me,
because I'll destroy you.

109
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,157
Get it, "donut"?

110
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:20,861
I love her,
but she ain't right in the head.

111
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,531
Whoo!

112
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,802
Thorgy with a T-H and orgy,

I'm not 29 years old.
Where did that come from?

115
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:39,079
I'm colorful, I'm fun,
and I'm a fashion clown.

116

A-Thorable.

117
00:04:40,682 --> 00:04:42,683

How are you?
Now just one more.

141
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:44,811
The New York girls,
they get really excited.

142
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,181

<i>Maybe some of</i>

resentful that there's so much
New York City representation.

150
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:03,730
There's a reason New York City
has some of the best

drag queens in the world,

152
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,733
and that is a fact.

153
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,536
This is a gag.
The children don't even know.

154
00:06:11,406 --> 00:06:12,773
All right, ladies.

155
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:14,842

Uh-oh, this is trouble.

157
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,512
Don't say "Beetlejuice"
three times.

158
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:19,880
Too late.

00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,299
Creole fish.

178
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,234
It's like a whole nother level
of drag right here.

179
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,503
If you made it to
"RuPaul's Drag Race,"

180
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,604
you made it, honey.

181
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,606
Dirty South represent.

182
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,608
Well, I'm a cheap queen.

183
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:22,876
She's on a budget.

184
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,945
Um, I don't mean cheap.
Resourceful.

185
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,146
Yeah, resourceful.

186
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:28,115
<i>Chi Chi walked in</i>
<i>in a trash bag.</i>

187
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:31,418
Chi Chi will take herself
out in a trash bag.

188
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,053
Hefty, Hefty, Hefty.

189
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,057
It's Derrick, bitch.

190
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,759
Ooh, hit me baby.

191
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
Yeah!

192
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,763
My name is Derrick Barry.
I'm 32 years old.

193
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:45,465
<i>I may look angelic,</i>
<i>but I am not that innocent.</i>

194
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,100
<i>I'm a Britney Spears</i>
<i>impersonator.</i>

195
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,836
I impersonate her
six nights a week

196
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:50,404
on the Las Vegas Strip.

197
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,739
<i>I would love to believe</i>

198
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,708
<i>that I'm the best</i>
<i>Britney in the world.</i>

199
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,643
That's what people say.

200
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,345
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:00,080
Hey!
How are you?

202
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,682
Derrick Barry
is huge competition.

203
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:04,251
She is a quasi-celebrity.

204
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,720
Okay, I want to know
who else did this.

205
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,523
Who else has been
carb-free for two weeks?

206
00:08:14,362 --> 00:08:16,396
Hello, hello, hello.

207
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,704
Beautiful.
Welcome, ladies.

208
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,205
Come through, hat!

209
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:27,541
Now, are you ready
to make herstory?

210
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,042
all:
Yes!

211
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,845
Well, guess what?
You already have.

212
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:36,049
This is the 100th episode
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

213
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,552
And they said it wouldn't last.

214
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:41,054
Now, an occasion
such as this

215
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:45,325
demands to be acknowledged
on an epic scale.

216
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,594
So I've arranged a photo shoot

217
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,797
with some extra special
guest stars.

218
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:53,066
The Barbie Twins?
Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

219
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:57,471
Ready for your close-up,
because if you get upstaged,

220
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:01,608
this 100th episode
could be your last.

221
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:08,415
Now, let's go.

222
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,351
Whoo, baby, start them engines,
because it's time for

223
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,188
"RuPaul's Drag Race
Season 8: RuVealed."

224
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:16,290
Yes, honey, watch along
with Ru and I

225
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,593
as we dish and take you inside
the dragster studio.

226
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:22,095
Uh-huh, all will be
revealed, honey,

227
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:24,031
so jump in and hang on.

228
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:27,034
<i> May the best woman,</i>
<i>best woman win </i>

229
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:31,503
Welcome back.
Smile.

230
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,839
Time for our first challenge.

231
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,978
Naysha Lopez,
welcome, darling.

232
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:43,081
In honor of our
100th episode,

233
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,251
I've gathered the champions
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

234
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,619
Legendary!

235
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,653
BeBe Zahara Benet.

236
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,488
Tyra Sanchez.

237
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,123
Raja.

238
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,892
Sharon Needles.

239
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,026
Boo.

240
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,828
Chad Michaels.

241
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,930
Jinkx Monsoon.

242
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,931
Work!

243
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,000
Violet Chachki.

244
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,270
And Bianca Del Rio...

245
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,440
could not be here
so we just hired a circus clown.

246
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,576
The weird thing is, nobody
could tell the difference.

247
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,912
Now, for your first
photo challenge,

248
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,780
we are going to take
some photographs

249
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,016
with the great Mathu Andersen.

250
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,451
We're gonna find out
if you have what it takes

251
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,554
to stand amongst greatness.

252
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,555
Got it.

253
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:26,891
Faces on lock, and go.

254
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,494
Body.
Face.

255
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,063
Why, she's covered
in black cock.

256
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,898
Sorry bout it.

257
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,367
Queens of a feather
stick together.

258
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,670
Next,
Bob The Drag Queen.

259
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,205
Lil' Kim up in the house.

260
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:42,073
She's trying to keep it
fresh and clean.

261
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,309
Yeah, you got one more left.

262
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,077
I'll just looked shocked.

263
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,612
I like her.
She's silly.

264
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,781
She's keeping it editorial,
real and art.

265
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,082
Yes.

266
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,986
Acid Betty, we will see
if you have what it takes

267
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,590
to sit among
the goddesses, all right?

268
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,426
Yes, RuPaul,
very intimidating.

269
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,862
Sitting next to
these wannabe-ass drag queens.

270
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,236
<i>Well, you passed</i>
<i>the acid test, Betty.</i>

271
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,004
Come through, Kim Chi.

272
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,241
Yes, give me anim-azing.

273
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,710
Go big, Naomi Smalls.

274
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,745
Oh, all of that right there.

275
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,847
<i>Naomi Smalls</i>
<i>looks really hot,</i>

276
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,416
but she does have cliff hangers.

277
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,618
You see her toes, like,

278
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,754
literally
clinging onto the shoe.

279
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,390
Boner killer.
Wah, wah.

280
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,394
Robbie Turner.

281
00:11:37,796 --> 00:11:40,064
This sleeve happens to be
in my light, darling.

282
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,199
Well, you should move.

283
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Rawr!

284
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,604
Know your place, bitch.
Season eight winner.

285
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,207
Season four winner.

286
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,775
Difference.

287
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:55,213
Gorgeous.
Welcome to my home.

288
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,681
Thank you, darling.

289
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,150
Sharon, did she try
to come for you?

290
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,286
Oh, yeah,
she came for me.

291
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,788
Next up, Thorgy Thor.

292
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,225
It's time for a queen orgy,
Thorgy.

293
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,893
Whoo!

294
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,863
<i>Looking good,</i>
<i>feeling Thorgeous.</i>

295
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,898
Next up, Chi Chi DeVayne.

296
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,166
Nice.

297
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,001
<i>Pose the house down.</i>

298
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,771
Dax ExclamationPoint.

299
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,772
Get it.

300
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:22,640
<i>Take it to the Dax.</i>

301
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,809
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

302
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,810
Model for me.

303
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,111
Escándalo.

304
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,247
You own everything.

305
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,449
Except for that sofa.
It's a rental.

306
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,651
Laila McQueen.

307
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,119
Oh, okay.

308
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,590
You remind me of a dog trying
to get comfortable on the couch.

309
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,191
Everyone is so gorgeous,

310
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,727
and here I am looking
like a Beetlejuice trash bag.

311
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,163
Oh, my God.

312
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,399
She's like the Hamburglar
scurrying around behind people.

313
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,767
I'm lovin' it.

314
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,935
<i>Stripes, girl.</i>

315
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,072
From Las Vegas, Nevada,
Derrick Barry.

316
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,907
That's it,
make them your backup dancers.

317
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:56,908
Yes.

318
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,076
This is the last shot.

319
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:00,478
Hit me, baby, one more time.

320
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,146
Oh, she's toxic.

321
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:05,750
Girl, the season of Britney
jokes has only just begun.

322
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,653
A legendary design challenge
from a past season.

323
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,754
Ugh.

324
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,257
<i>Derrick Barry</i>
<i>is not creative.</i>

325
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,626
He will definitely
have the hardest time.

326
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,595
Aww, leave Britney alone!
Or don't.

327
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,530
We'll be right back.

328
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:21,235
Hey, we're back,

329
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,904
but weren't
those commercials great?

330
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:27,441
Ladies,
over the past 99 episodes,

331
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,578
I'm sure you've yelled
at your TV,

332
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:33,514
"Girl, I coulda slayed
that challenge."

333
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,017
Now it's your chance
to prove it.

334
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:38,085
For this week's maxi
challenge...

335
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:40,054
Where my judges' table at?

336
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:43,491
A legendary design challenge
from a past season.

337
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,793
It's your job
to take the materials

338
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:47,195
and make them your own.

339
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:48,462
Now to assign the looks,

340
00:13:48,463 --> 00:13:51,165
I've chosen one of your names
at random.

341
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:55,636
Robbie Turner.

342
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,339
Now, Robbie, you get to assign

343
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,810
all the queens' looks
and choose your own.

344
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:06,280
It's time
to bring back my girls.

345
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,950
From season one,
Shannel,

346
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:12,286

thrift store challenge.

347
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:14,455
Latrice Royale,

presenting our Pride Float
challenge from season four.

349
00:14:19,228 --> 00:14:21,462
Next, Violet Chachki,

350
00:14:21,463 --> 00:14:24,799
presenting the Money Ball
from season three.

351
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,635
It's time to assign
these three looks.

352
00:14:27,636 --> 00:14:30,738
All right, Robbie Turner,
who gets Drag on a Dime?

353
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,908
Naysha.
Who gets Float Your Boat?

394
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:16,844
Who's gonna get a big
Christmas package?

395
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,347
Derrick Barry.
Yes.

396
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:22,617
And, Robbie, does this mean
you're going to be doing it

397
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,785
doggy style?

398
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,121
<i>Can you believe I forget</i>
<i>to pick a theme for myself?</i>

399
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,756
Guess who gets stuck
with the poodle?

400
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:30,391
It's a real doggy downer.

401
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:34,162
Now if I've said this once,
I've said it 100 times.

402
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:35,563
Literally.

403
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:39,367
Start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

404
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:46,374
Yeah!
All right!

405
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,277
Oh, my God.
Let's do it.

406
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,847
All right,
this is kind of interesting.

407
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,549
<i>I'm super excited</i>
<i>about this challenge</i>

408
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,217
because I've watched
every episode,

409
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:58,452
<i>and I could kill</i>
<i>any one of these challenges.</i>

410
00:16:58,453 --> 00:16:59,987
Whoo,
this is fun.

411
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,222
We'll see.

412
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:04,392
Oh, these are shitty bags.

413
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:05,860
<i>So I'm looking through</i>
<i>my materials,</i>

414
00:17:05,861 --> 00:17:07,862
and I realize
that a lot of these things

415
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,264
can't be made into clothing.

416
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,200
Dog chew toys, ropes.

417
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,569
You guys, I brought treats.
Dog treats.

418
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,971
It's just a couple of treats.

419
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,673
Have you ever tasted one of
those for real?

420
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:21,976
Uh, paging Nomi and Cristal.

421
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:25,213
You know, I'm from the South,
we eat everything, honey.

422
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:28,349
Possums, rats, raccoons.
Possums?

423
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,984
What did she call me?

424
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:33,421
She's just country as fucking
catfish sandwiches.

425
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,056
She's like country.

426
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:37,124
<i> </i>

427
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,094
There's so much stuff that I'm
trying not to get overwhelmed,

428
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,197
and, like, I got this and this
and this and this and this.

429
00:17:43,198 --> 00:17:46,267
I don't do drag on a dime.

430
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:48,603
<i>I don't sew.</i>
<i>I'm a pageant girl.</i>

431
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:51,072
<i>I brought so many</i>
<i>beautiful garments.</i>

432
00:17:51,073 --> 00:17:52,573
I spend money.

433
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,877
Make it work, bitch.
Make it work.

434
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,415
There is so much stuff to use.

435
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,519
My theme for the challenge is
The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.

436
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,889
Season 8 greetings.

437
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,490
My strategy
for this first challenge

438
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:13,127
is to basically still come out
with my Britney look.

439
00:18:13,128 --> 00:18:14,495
Like, I just want to add to it.

440
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:16,430
So what kind of vibe
are you going for?

441
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:19,634
Like,
this Christmas skirt.

442
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:21,135
Like a tree skirt,

443
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:25,907
but then I don't know
how to finish a whole outfit.

444
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:27,375
Girl.

445
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:30,077
<i>Derrick Barry</i>
<i>is not creative,</i>

446
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:31,979
obviously 'cause
he's impersonating someone else

447
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
<i>his whole life.</i>

448
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,115
He will definitely have

449
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,616
the hardest time
with this challenge.

450
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:37,919
And I'm like stuck on
what to do for the top.

451
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,421
Santa baby,
you better come quick.

452
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:41,923
<i>Coming up...</i>

453
00:18:44,126 --> 00:18:46,460
My fucking panties just ripped.

454
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,362
This some bullshit.

455
00:18:48,363 --> 00:18:50,731
I have no clue how she's gonna
fix this outfit.

456
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,366
I think she's done.

457
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,368
Whew, it's gonna get tore up
right after this.

458
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,035
Welcome back.

459
00:18:57,036 --> 00:19:00,372
Runway number 100 dead ahead.

460
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,607
I actually
do a lot of pageants,

461
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,376
and I won this pageant.

462
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,611
It's an international pageant.
It's called Miss Continental.

463
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,347
And it is one of
the most prestigious pageants.

464
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,649
I've heard of it.

465
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,584
Yeah, so I'm
a former Miss Continental.

466
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,818
That's awesome.
Yeah.

467
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,453
I hate pageants.

468
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,656
Girl, I've done,
like, two pageants.

469
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,091
And you didn't win them, and
that's why you hate pageants.

470
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,092
Exactly.

471
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,427
I knew it.
I knew it.

472
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,162
That always happens to someone
who don't win.

473
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,331
Bitch, I was robbed.

474
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:30,435
It just sucks that pageants
get such a bad rap.

475
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,938
<i>I owe a whole lot</i>
<i>of my work ethic</i>

476
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:36,141
<i>and who I am</i>
<i>to pageant experiences.</i>

477
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,544
So, Derrick, how long
you been doing Britney?

478
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:42,414
I started on Halloween 2003.

479
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,215
And how long
you been doing drag?

480
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,384
Halloween 2003.

481
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,320
<i>I've been doing Britney</i>
<i>for 12 years,</i>

482
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,121
and I think a lot of
the other girls

483
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,623
are not gonna think I can do
anything else.

484
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,159
I have to prove
that I can do more than Britney.

485
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,760
I find
there's two breeds of queen.

486
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,762
There's Halloween queens,
and there's pride queens.

487
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,997
I was a pride queen.
Really?

488
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,333
I, like, started drag
on Gay Pride wearing,

489
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,468
like, a shitty potato sack

490
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,937
and a wig from, you know,
who knows where.

491
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,072
Was that this Pride?

492
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,541
Ooh, I like her.

493
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,476
Oh you little bitch.

494
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,511
Oh, Laila!

495
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,382
How long have you
been doing drag?

496
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,917
I've been doing drag
for two and a half years.

497
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,752
Does your family
support your drag?

498
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,320
My family doesn't know
that I do drag.

499
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,389
They don't know?
Really?

500
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,857
No.
At all?

501
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,959
Like, my mom thinks
I'm a makeup artist.

502
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,362
Has your mother ever seen you
in drag ever,

503
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,696
like pictures or anything?

504
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,198
Well, I've shown her
pictures of me in drag

505
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,300
and she thinks they're, like,
makeup jobs that I did.

506
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,501
She doesn't recognize
that it's me.

507
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:37,636
Stop.
Really?

508
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,505
Yeah.
Um, does she have a TV?

509
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,508
Finding out that I do drag
because growing up,

510
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,378
I always felt like I could
never be the model child

511
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:49,414
that all Asian mothers want.

512
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,017
I've already disappointed her
so many times in her life.

513
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:55,987
She could even stop
talking to me.

514
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,623
And...

515
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,496
And you know, I'm just scared
of letting her down again.

516
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,472
Uh-oh.

517
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,107
What's the matter, girl?
Speak it out.

518
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,209
I go to put on my outfit
and what happens?

519
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,379
Pop.
My outfit has just ripped apart.

520
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,481
This some bullshit.

521
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,319
My fucking panties
just ripped at the last second.

522
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,853
And it's all coming apart.

523
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,589
This some bullshit.

524
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,057
Fuck.

525
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,759
I am going into panic mode
right now.

526
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,829
<i>Girl, you cannot go home,</i>
<i>not on the first day.</i>

527
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,967
I want this so freaking bad.

528
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,335
Like, I'm so distraught,

529
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,703
I don't even know
what I'm doing now.

530
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:47,038
I have no clue
how she's gonna fix this outfit.

531
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,340
<i>I think she's done.</i>

532
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:49,741
I hope you know
the lip sync song,

533
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,410
'cause your outfit
is crumbling before your hands.

534
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,013
Listen, never count anybody
out on this show.

535
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,650
Whew! Tell 'em, Michelle.
Here we go!

536
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:06,124
<i> Cover girl,</i>
<i>put the bass in your walk </i>

537
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,662
<i> Head to toe,</i>
<i>let your whole body talk </i>

538
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,364
<i>And what.</i>

539
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,968
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

540
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:20,038
Michelle Visage,
happy 100th.

541
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,040
Happy birthday,
gorgeous.

542
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,876
Style superstar,
Carson Kressley.

543
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,912
You look amazing for 100.

544
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,314
I know, I don't look
a day over 95.

545
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,085
And the straight talking
Ross Mathews.

546
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,956
Now, on a scale of 1 to 100,
how excited are you?

547
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,659
Like, a dragzillion.

548
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,495
And the fabulous
Nicole Richie.

549
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,497
Hey, kitty girl.
Hi, gorge.

550
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,666
Your dress is very
"Wizard of Oz."

551
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,268
Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?

552
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,536
Or a sandwich.

553
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,038
Now I'm thinking
about a sandwich.

554
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,474
This week, our queens posed
with Drag Race champions.

555
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,709
And tonight,

556
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,312
they're debuting
their own creations

557
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:02,447
based on a design challenge

558
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:05,617
from the anals
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

559
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,452
Michelle,
did I say that right?

560
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,788
Eh.
Eh, close enough.

561
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,759
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

562
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:18,997
<i> The realness </i>

563
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,633
First up, Acid Betty,
Money Ball.

564
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,301
Well,
bitch better have my money.

565
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,671
<i>I do freaky drag,</i>
<i>and I think I do it the best.</i>

566
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:29,074
<i>The drag scene should not</i>
<i>be homogenized.</i>

567
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,244
<i>Therefore, Acid Betty</i>
<i>is here to represent.</i>

568
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,913
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
make it rain.

569
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,783
Cash is queen.
I own everything.

570
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,153
Bob The Drag Queen,
Gone with The Window.

571
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,356
Yes, honey,
lead with the bag.

572
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:45,824
I love it.

573
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,292
<i>This outfit shows</i>
<i>I have the ability</i>

574
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,860
<i>to make a finished garment.</i>

575
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:53,531
<i>The fabric is hideous, but</i>
<i>the construction is everything.</i>

576
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,300
No shade,
but that dress looks like

577
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,868
it was made out of curtains.

578
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,070
And does her carpet
match the drapes?

579
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:03,708
Dax ExclamationPoint,
Hello Kitty.

580
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,610
Hello, Herve Leger.

581
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,446
Hello, Angeline.
Meow.

582
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,514
<i>This outfit</i>
<i>is totally me.</i>

583
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,082
<i>I love Hello Kitty.</i>

584
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:13,285
<i>Anything a 12-year-old Asian</i>
<i>girl wants, I want it more.</i>

585
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,453
I do love a pink pussy.

586
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,655
It's better than a purple one.

587
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,490
Why it got to be purple?

588
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:21,893
Naysha Lopez,
Drag on a Dime.

589
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:23,528
Fashion sure is changing.

590
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,631
<i>I am serving Greek goddess.</i>

591
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,167
<i>Face, body, glamour.</i>

592
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,469
Peek-a-Ru, I see you.
Uh-huh.

593
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,139
A dress that makes cents.
Not dollars.

594
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,308
Kim Chi, Hair Ball.

595
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:39,844
You got a little--

596
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,481
<i>I've made a lion outfit</i>
<i>inspired by Givenchy.</i>

597
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,884
Yes, the lion stomps tonight.

598
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,185
<i>A golden treasure.</i>

599
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:50,088
<i>This outfit is big, grand,</i>
<i>and conceptual.</i>

600
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,690
<i>It's Kim Chi.</i>

601
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,858
She stepped that pussy up.
Meow.

602
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:57,162
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
Sugar Ball.

603
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,863
Gumdrop it like it's hot.

604
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,199
<i>I feel like a goddess is</i>
<i>at this moment.</i>

605
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,868
<i>It's sugar, azúcar.</i>

606
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,103
<i>Are you ready for my cuckoo?</i>

607
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,706
Yeah.
Yes.

608
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,874
Now see, that's the real sugar
right there.

609
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,444
That's her sugar walls.
Whoa!

610
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:15,213
Naomi Smalls,
Float Your Boat.

611
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,716
Washington's cross-dressing
the Delaware.

612
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:20,719
She has my dream chest.
Yeah.

613
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,488
<i>I'm trying to give you</i>
<i>'90s supermodel walk,</i>

614
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,824
<i>and this boat is covering</i>
<i>half of it.</i>

615
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:28,126
<i>When I can finally</i>
<i>step out of this boat,</i>

616
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,828
<i>that's when the judges</i>
<i>can really see</i>

617
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,029
<i>the true Naomi Smalls.</i>

618
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,163
Land ho.

619
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,165
<i>I am giving you</i>
<i>Naomi Campbell</i>

620
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,701
<i>strutting down</i>
<i>a Versace runway.</i>

621
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,836
That boat looks heavy.

622
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,504
Aren't there any seamen
to help her?

623
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,172
The seamen
are all below deck.

624
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:42,641
Okay, y'all are just dirty.

625
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:45,243
Chi Chi DeVayne,
Glitter Ball.

626
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:48,113
You know I always say, when
life hands you disco balls...

627
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,114
What do you do?

628
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,849
You make an outfit.

629
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,917
Yeah.

630
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,184
<i>After my little meltdown,</i>

631
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,753
<i>I'm just gonna</i>
<i>roll with the punches,</i>

632
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:58,423
<i>and I'm really feeling this</i>
<i>disco queen kind of vibe.</i>

633
00:25:58,424 --> 00:25:59,824
<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

634
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,694
Sparkle, Chi Chi, sparkle.

635
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:05,430
Yes.
Balls to the walls.

636
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:08,533
Thorgy Thor,
Red Velvet Cake Couture.

637
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,102
This is feeling
a little menstrual.

638
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:12,771
I'm glad you said it,
and I didn't.

639
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,339
<i>I don't wear gowns,</i>

640
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,474
<i>but for this challenge</i>
<i>I just wanted to feel decadent,</i>

641
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:19,844
<i>and I still kept</i>
<i>with my cartoon hair,</i>

642
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,546
<i>giving you cream cheese</i>
<i>realness.</i>

643
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,448
Oh, happy birthday!

644
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:26,918
Have her cake
and serve it too.

645
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,888
Robbie Turner,
Bitch Ball.

646
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,222
Who let the dogs out?

647
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,491
I love two bitches
on a runway.

648
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,461
<i>I think I'm looking more like</i>
<i>a sheep than a poodle.</i>

649
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,729
<i>The dog is looking at me like,</i>

650
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,464
<i>"Get me the fuck</i>
<i>out of here."</i>

651
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,732
<i>I'm looking at the dog like,</i>

652
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,500
<i>"Get</i> me <i>the fuck</i>
<i>out of here."</i>

653
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,768
<i>This is not going well.</i>

654
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,804
I give this look about
a canine out of ten.

655
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:48,940
Uh-huh, she's spayed,
and she's throwing shade.

656
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,508
Both those bitches
are over it.

657
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,712
Derrick Barry,
The Queen Who Mopped Christmas.

658
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:54,980
Well, hey, y'all.

659
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,648
<i>I'm giving you</i>
<i>Christmas in Vegas.</i>

660
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,016
<i>I'm serving body,</i>

661
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,551
<i>but I'm also giving comedy.</i>

662
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,920
Whoa!
Ho, ho, ho.

663
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,421
She's trimming her bush.

664
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,523
Is that mistletoe
or camel toe?

665
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,058
Girl, I could see her urethra.

666
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,526
She's putting the X
back in Xmas.

667
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:11,997
Yes, she is.
Oops, she's doing it again.

668
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:15,233
Laila McQueen,
Apocalyptic Couture.

669
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:18,570
Now, her pussy's not on fire,
but her shoulder is.

670
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:20,338
<i>This look</i>
<i>is classic Laila.</i>

671
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,207
<i>I'm loving this cute</i>
<i>little jacket I made.</i>

672
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,209
<i>I'm giving you, like,</i>
<i>a post-apocalyptic,</i>

673
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,710
<i>like, devil commander, like,</i>

674
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,113
<i>the world is over,</i>
<i>and I'm here to take over.</i>

675
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,749
Laila McQueen,
Beyond Thunderdome.

676
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,450
<i> The realness </i>

677
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,785
Bam! Commercial time.

678
00:27:36,135 --> 00:27:38,504
Okay, my girls served chic,
now we critique.

679
00:27:38,505 --> 00:27:39,872
Welcome, ladies.

680
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:43,442
When I call your name,
please step forward.

681
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:45,678
Bob The Drag Queen.

682
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,881
Dax ExclamationPoint.

683
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:51,183
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

684
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:53,619
Chi Chi DeVayne.

685
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,122
Thorgy Thor.

686
00:27:57,123 --> 00:28:00,426
You are all...

687
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:01,927
Safe.
Safe!

688
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,733
Now, you may leave the stage.

689
00:28:07,734 --> 00:28:09,034
Bye-bye.

690
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:16,208
Ladies, you represent the tops
and the bottoms of the week.

691
00:28:16,209 --> 00:28:17,609
You don't know them like that.

692
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,245
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

693
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:21,780
Acid Betty.

694
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:23,282
I love that you're different.

695
00:28:23,283 --> 00:28:25,451
Every inch was kind of
covered with a thought.

696
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:26,819
To me,
that's what drag is about.

697
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,520
And then the photo,

698
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:30,322
<i>you seem like you're a little</i>
<i>bit more of the avant-garde,</i>

699
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:33,325
artsy, like, you're giving me
Tunnel 1993.

700
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:35,260
I was there.
I might've seen you there.

701
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:37,129
You might've.
Great job.

702
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,865
Next up, Naysha Lopez.

703
00:28:39,866 --> 00:28:41,166
You're gorgeous.
Thank you.

704
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,202
You're giving me Eva Longoria,
Miss America.

705
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:44,870
I think, Naysha,
you're beautiful,

706
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:46,505
but when you're part of
an ensemble photo,

707
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:47,706
<i>you really want to stand out.</i>

708
00:28:47,707 --> 00:28:49,708
The dark hair and the dark top,

709
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,276
I don't think it works
in this picture.

710
00:28:51,277 --> 00:28:53,212
That big gold piece
just makes you look thick,

711
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:55,447
and I just don't think
it looks good.

712
00:28:55,448 --> 00:28:58,050
This is actually the first
garment I've ever made.

713
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:01,387
I don't really sew.

714
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:03,789
All right, well,
thank you very much.

715
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,425
Next up, Kim Chi.
Hi.

716
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:08,627
Your photo,
it's pretty fabulous.

717
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:10,396
And I really like
your runway look.

718
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,563
You were giving me, like,

719
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,899
this Cowardly Lion anime
ferociousness.

720
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,134
I think it totally worked.

721
00:29:15,135 --> 00:29:16,802
All right, lion queen.

722
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:17,903
Benefit of the doubt
and say

723
00:29:17,904 --> 00:29:20,139
the walk
was a character choice.

724
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,540
In my personal eyes,
I'm an anime character

725
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,175
who works
as a high fashion model.

726
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:24,543
You're just a total nerd.

727
00:29:24,544 --> 00:29:27,279
I am.
I love that.

728
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,282
And by the way, I like that
you kept your areolas bald.

729
00:29:30,283 --> 00:29:32,718
The breasts are the windows
to the soul, for sure.

730
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,387
Man, she is so wise.

731
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,389
Next up, Naomi Smalls.

732
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,959
I love that you
are rocking a boy chest.

733
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,330
You're giving me
like, '70s "Studio 54."

734
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:46,632
The Pride Float
was beautifully decorated,

735
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,500
but it became really cumbersome.

736
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:50,102
And I almost saw you thinking,

737
00:29:50,103 --> 00:29:54,406
"I have to get back in that boat
and strap it on."

738
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:56,175
And I'm saying that
about the boat.

739
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:58,010
Yeah, I know, how many times
have you said that in your life?

740
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,178
Girl.
Yeah.

741
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:01,447
But the picture.
Hello?

742
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:02,681
And it's a big butt.
Bam!

743
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:04,049
I believe they call that
serving it.

744
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,651
Okay.

745
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:07,519
That needs to come through
with everything that you do,

746
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,589
whether you're dragging a
50-pound boat with you or not.

747
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,758
Next up,
Robbie Turner.

748
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,293
Your photo, I loved,

749
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,528
because you're giving me kind of
funny glamour there.

750
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,230
And now, the bad news.

751
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:19,665
Fur?
It's like a fringe.

752
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,568
Fringy kind of
carpety-looking stuff.

753
00:30:22,569 --> 00:30:24,903
You're literally a blob.

754
00:30:24,904 --> 00:30:27,706
We lose all shape, and
from the side, it's even worse.

755
00:30:27,707 --> 00:30:29,541
And you got to choose
your challenge.

756
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:32,745
I actually forgot that I--
to choose one for myself.

757
00:30:32,746 --> 00:30:35,581
I didn't have
my '40s dress pattern,

758
00:30:35,582 --> 00:30:37,149
but I was trying to
figure it out.

759
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,686
So, it was like a series
of misfortunate events.

760
00:30:40,687 --> 00:30:41,987
Ain't nobody gonna talk
about the fact

761
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:45,224
that she is holding a bag
of dog doo?

762
00:30:45,225 --> 00:30:47,493
Next up, Derrick Barry.

763
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:49,361
Your look tonight,
it's adorable.

764
00:30:49,362 --> 00:30:51,664
I will say it's pretty simple.

765
00:30:51,665 --> 00:30:53,298
I like the comedic moment

766
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:55,000
where you trimmed
your holiday bush.

767
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,568
And then your photo,

768
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,903
like, everyone in this photo

769
00:30:57,904 --> 00:30:59,772
looks like
they're your backup dancers,

770
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:00,973
and you're the star.

771
00:31:00,974 --> 00:31:02,708
Wow.
We've seen Britney now.

772
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,777
My personal challenge to you

773
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:07,279
is to show me everything else
but Britney.

774
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,381
Gimme--gimme more.

775
00:31:09,382 --> 00:31:11,083
I do want to see more of it,

776
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:13,719
but we do want to see
other things.

777
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,788
Up next,
Laila McQueen.

778
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:17,456
Hi, Laila.
Hey, bitch.

779
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:18,657
I love the shoulder detail.

780
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:19,758
Did you sew that?

781
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,060
I sewed the jacket, yes.

782
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:22,695
That's pretty impressive.
Thank you.

783
00:31:22,696 --> 00:31:26,298
But I felt like the bottom
half was just a cop out.

784
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:28,701
To me, it's just like,
Wynonna Judd opened the oven

785
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:30,135
too quickly and got
a little, like, you know,

786
00:31:30,136 --> 00:31:32,304
burnt on the outside.

787
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:36,008
In the picture, we lose you
crumpling up into a ball.

788
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,943
You're with all these
kind of legendary people,

789
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,946
and it's almost like your
body's saying "I'm not worthy."

790
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,115
Do you think
that your missteps

791
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:45,451
would warrant you
in the bottom?

792
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,353
I don't think that I am

793
00:31:47,354 --> 00:31:48,687
the least put together.

794
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,522
Who do you think
is the least put together?

795
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:53,759
I think Naomi.
Her look is very plain.

796
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,862
Do you agree with that,
Naomi?

797
00:31:56,863 --> 00:32:00,699
No. I tried to take something
that was from a past season

798
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,269
and make it new and fresh.

799
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,405
Well, thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

800
00:32:06,406 --> 00:32:08,874
While you untuck backstage,

801
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:12,177
the judges and I
will deliberate.

802
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,713
All right now, just between
us squirrel friends,

803
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:15,881
what do you think?

804
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:18,050
Let's start with Acid Betty.

805
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:20,986
In the photo, she looks great,
but she is this punk girl.

806
00:32:20,987 --> 00:32:22,421
Like, give me
a little screaming...

807
00:32:22,422 --> 00:32:24,356
Ahh!
Tongue out punkness.

808
00:32:24,357 --> 00:32:27,059
I don't hate her photo,
and like her name implies,

809
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,128
she's kind of a trip,
and she's a little East Village.

810
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:31,730
Well, you know, I did
a lot of antacid in the '60s,

811
00:32:31,731 --> 00:32:34,967
and I think that Acid Betty
really represents that.

812
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:39,071
<i>Alright, Naysha Lopez.</i>

813
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:41,974
Her photo, unfortunately,
I think she got lost.

814
00:32:41,975 --> 00:32:43,876
And also,
don't stand on that stage

815
00:32:43,877 --> 00:32:45,377
and tell us
it's the first dress you made.

816
00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:47,579
I mean, this is not the place
you make your first dress.

817
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,616
You make your first dress
when you've learned that

818
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:51,917
you're gonna come on the show.

819
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:53,385
Or you make them
when your mom's at work,

820
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:54,987
and you're in the sixth grade.

821
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:57,222
Chile, we have all been there.

822
00:32:57,223 --> 00:33:00,059
<i>All right, next up,</i>
<i>Kim Chi.</i>

823
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,860
I love the photograph.

824
00:33:01,861 --> 00:33:03,362
<i>She was kind of</i>
<i>the queen of the castle</i>

825
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:04,863
<i>in this anime jungle.</i>

826
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:06,865
Everything about her tonight
made me happy,

827
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:09,101
except for
that lumbering walk.

828
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:10,336
Right, because
she was serving a little bit

829
00:33:10,337 --> 00:33:11,337
of Sasquatch on the runway.

830
00:33:11,338 --> 00:33:12,571
Sasquatch that walk.

831
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,006
You can say Yeti that walk.

832
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:17,042
Yeti that walk.

833
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:20,112
<i>Next up, Naomi Smalls.</i>

834
00:33:20,113 --> 00:33:22,314
All I saw
was a really tiny thing

835
00:33:22,315 --> 00:33:24,350
<i>lumbering with</i>
<i>a heavy ass boat.</i>

836
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,318
Sorry boat it.

837
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,253
Contrast of her like,
fumbling with the boat.

838
00:33:28,254 --> 00:33:30,155
It's like a cartoon of an ant

839
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,458
carrying a giant piece
of cheese.

840
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:33,592
<i>Well, that's the picture</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

841
00:33:33,593 --> 00:33:35,294
<i>It says,</i>
<i>"bow down, bitches."</i>

842
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:37,229
If she doesn't bring
the photo her

843
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,265
to this her,
to me, she's gone.

844
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,267
<i>Moving on down</i>
<i>to Robbie Turner.</i>

845
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:44,370
This look in her photo
is probably her go-to look.

846
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:47,139
<i>It's that Carole Lombard</i>
<i>meets Carol Burnett.</i>

847
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,708
But what we saw today
was basic.

848
00:33:49,709 --> 00:33:51,143
She said
she forgot to choose

849
00:33:51,144 --> 00:33:52,845
a category for herself.

850
00:33:52,846 --> 00:33:54,947
If she put any creativity
into that,

851
00:33:54,948 --> 00:33:56,181
she could've turned it out.

852
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:57,416
And that's a shame,
because I like

853
00:33:57,417 --> 00:33:58,550
what I saw in the picture.

854
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:00,319
A doggone shame, I'd say.

855
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,620
Her Britney is amazing.

856
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:02,988
We know he can nail
the Britney thing.

857
00:34:02,989 --> 00:34:04,490
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the photo was phenomenal.</i>

858
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:06,625
I'm glad she brought it
the first episode.

859
00:34:06,626 --> 00:34:09,361
Now bring Derrick Barry
to the table.

860
00:34:09,362 --> 00:34:11,163
<i>Laila McQueen.</i>

861
00:34:11,164 --> 00:34:12,898
She did the most
basic bottom half to that.

862
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,366
I expect so much more.

863
00:34:14,367 --> 00:34:17,736
This is season eight, and
the bar has been raised so high.

864
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:20,406
There was just
nothing standing out for me.

865
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:23,175
The worst picture
of the week, by far.

866
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:24,576
Youch!

867
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:25,878
Interesting
because she is an artist.

868
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,180
That warrants
a second chance to me.

869
00:34:28,181 --> 00:34:29,615
Silence.

870
00:34:29,616 --> 00:34:31,150
I've made my decision.

871
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,319
Whose look gets the hook?

872
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,553
Find out after this.

873
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:38,436
Oh, my sweet gherkins.

874
00:34:38,437 --> 00:34:39,904
It's time.

875
00:34:39,905 --> 00:34:42,807
Welcome back, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

876
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:48,346
Acid Betty...

877
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:49,380
you're safe.

878
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:50,715
Thank you.

879
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:53,885
But does she have change
for a 20?

880
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:59,324
Kim Chi, your photo
and main stage presentation

881
00:34:59,325 --> 00:35:01,459
wigged us out.

882
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:05,930
Condragulations, you're the
winner of this week's challenge.

883
00:35:05,931 --> 00:35:08,466
No T, Ms. Chi, whoopee!

884
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:13,872
You've won $3,000
from selfieonastick.com.

885
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:17,342
The original and the best
selfie on a stick.

886
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:20,645
Say hi, everybody.
Cheese.

887
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:23,581
Bitch,
I just won $3,000.

888
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:26,417
<i>This win means I have a place</i>
<i>in this competition,</i>

889
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,553
and I am a force
to be reckoned with.

890
00:35:30,623 --> 00:35:33,858
Derrick Barry, you're safe.

891
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:35,426
Thank you.

892
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:39,097
Naomi Smalls, you're safe.

893
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:43,201
Fun fact, Naomi backwards
spells I moan.

894
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:49,107
Naysha Lopez,
you are gorgeous, but...

895
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,909
Thank you.

896
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:55,513
The judges felt shortchanged
by your Drag on a Dime.

897
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:57,882
<i></i> 

898
00:35:57,883 --> 00:36:00,184
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

899
00:36:00,185 --> 00:36:02,320
Naysha, please. Ugh!

900
00:36:02,321 --> 00:36:05,189
<i>I am absolutely gagging.</i>

901
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,292
I don't deserve
to be in the bottom two.

902
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:09,027
<i>You have some queen</i>

903
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:11,796
<i>rocking this $5 dress.</i>

904
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,898
I don't get it.

905
00:36:13,899 --> 00:36:17,802
Robbie Turner,
your photo was iconic,

906
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,339
but on the main stage,
you screwed the pooch.

907
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,507
Ru?

908
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:27,045
Laila McQueen,
you are an edgy artist,

909
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:30,381
but your photo and your
Post Apocalyptic Couture

910
00:36:30,382 --> 00:36:33,084
were not earth-shattering.

911
00:36:35,186 --> 00:36:36,821
Robbie Turner...

912
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,762
You're safe.

913
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:46,331
Oh.
All right.

914
00:36:46,332 --> 00:36:48,266
Wow.

915
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:52,403
Laila McQueen,
I'm sorry, my dear,

916
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:54,772
but you are up
for elimination.

917
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:57,008
My heart drops,
but I'm not gonna be

918
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,443
the first one to go home.

919
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:01,946
I'm gonna do every kind of
quasi-gimmick I have.

920
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:04,649
Two queens stand before me.

921
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,685
Ladies,
this is your last chance

922
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,220
to impress me

923
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:11,222
and save yourself

924
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,824
from elimination.

925
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,961
The time has come...

926
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:18,997
For you to lip-synch

927
00:37:18,998 --> 00:37:22,567
for your life.

928
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:24,903
Yas! Season 8 light cues.

929
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:26,604
Good luck,

930
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:29,240
and don't fuck it up.

931
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:39,884
<i> I stand here</i>
<i>waiting for you </i>

932
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:41,753
<i> To bang the gong </i>

933
00:37:41,754 --> 00:37:44,188
Speaking of Lady Gaga,
I was on her holiday

934
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:47,759
Muppet TV special,
and I've never seen in my life

935
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,061
that many costume options.

936
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:53,798
<i> If only fame</i>
<i>had an I.V., baby </i>

937
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:56,768
<i> Could I bear </i>

938
00:37:56,769 --> 00:37:59,270
<i> Being away from you </i>

939
00:37:59,271 --> 00:38:02,373
<i> I found the vein,</i>
<i>put it in here </i>

940
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:05,777
<i> I live for the applause,</i>
<i>applause, applause </i>

941
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,679
<i> I live for</i>
<i>the applause-plause </i>

942
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,247
<i> Live for</i>
<i>the applause-plause </i>

943
00:38:09,248 --> 00:38:13,017
<i> Live for the way that</i>
<i>you cheer and scream for me </i>

944
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:15,954
<i> The applause,</i>
<i>applause, applause </i>

945
00:38:15,955 --> 00:38:17,322

946
00:38:17,323 --> 00:38:19,157
<i> Give me the thing</i>

947
00:38:19,158 --> 00:38:20,625
<i> Turn the lights on </i>

948
00:38:20,626 --> 00:38:22,594
<i> Put your hands up,</i>
<i>make them touch </i>

949
00:38:22,595 --> 00:38:24,996
<i></i> Make it real loud 

950
00:38:24,997 --> 00:38:27,799
<i>Naysha is always giving</i>
<i>like, beautiful, sexy,</i>

951
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,935
J.Lo bombshell,
I feel it.

952
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,270
<i> Ooh </i>

953
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,606
<i> Touch, touch </i>

954
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:35,640
<i> Ooh </i>

955
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:37,175
<i> Touch, touch </i>

956
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:40,311
Laila is giving you sex
on a stick, and it's awesome.

957
00:38:40,312 --> 00:38:41,913
<i>She is looking</i>
<i>so good right now</i>

958
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,481
<i>throwing her body</i>
<i>all over the floor.</i>

959
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:46,751
<i> I live for the applause,</i>
<i>applause, applause </i>

960
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:51,756
<i> I live for the applause,</i>
<i>applause, applause </i>

961
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:53,892
The secret to keeping a wig
on so you can do that

962
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:56,060
is spirit gum plus bobby pins.

963
00:38:56,061 --> 00:39:01,599
<i> Make them touch,</i>
<i>touch </i>

964
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,003
<i> Put your hands up,</i>
<i>make them touch, touch </i>

965
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:07,438
<i> A-R-T-P-O-P </i>

966
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:10,375
Good job!

967
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,449
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

968
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:32,230
Laila McQueen,
shantay, you stay.

969
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:35,600
Truly, the first cut
is always the deepest.

970
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,502
You may join the other girls.

971
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,904
Thank you.

972
00:39:39,905 --> 00:39:41,272
Naysha Lopez,

973
00:39:41,273 --> 00:39:43,608
out of 100 queens,

974
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:46,744
you are by far
one of the most beautiful

975
00:39:46,745 --> 00:39:48,146
to grace the stage.

976
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:49,581
Thank you, Ru.

977
00:39:49,582 --> 00:39:52,517
And I'm sorry
to see you go so soon.

978
00:39:52,518 --> 00:39:54,419
I'm sorry that I
wasn't able to show you

979
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,054
everything that I had to offer.

980
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:58,823
Thank you, Ru,
for this opportunity.

981
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:02,427
Thank you.
Now, sashay away.

982
00:40:02,428 --> 00:40:04,429
Love you, beauty.

983
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:13,538
<i>I am first to go, and I feel</i>
<i>like I didn't let Ru see</i>

984
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,809
what I'm all about because
there's so much more to me.

985
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,812
<i>Ru, I want to thank you</i>
<i>for the platform</i>

986
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:22,013
<i>that you have given me</i>

987
00:40:22,014 --> 00:40:24,382
because not everyone
appreciates it.

988
00:40:24,383 --> 00:40:26,017
<i>I thank you for that</i>

989
00:40:26,018 --> 00:40:28,586
from the bottom
of my heart.

990
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:33,791
Well,
condragulations, ladies.

991
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,261
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

992
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:38,396
how in the hell you gonna
love somebody else?

993
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:39,764
Can I get an "amen" in here?

994
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,032
all: Amen.

995
00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:43,568
All right,
now let the music play.

996
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:44,936
Oh, my gag!

997
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:47,572
First episode up,
first queen down.

998
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:50,909
And next week, we start
another 100 episodes.

999
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,111
And it's gonna be pitch
perfect.

1000
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:54,579
Watch.
Bye!
