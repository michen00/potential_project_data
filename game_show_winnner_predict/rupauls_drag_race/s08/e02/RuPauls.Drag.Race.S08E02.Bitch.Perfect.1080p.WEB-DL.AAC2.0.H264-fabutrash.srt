245
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:38,081
     - Cynthia and Chi Chi,     
  you won the mini challenge,   

246
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,117
   so you are team captains.    

247
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:43,786
      Cynthia, your group       
      is the Lady Bitches,      

248
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:47,624
 the sweethearts of dragapella  
      from the prestigious      

249
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:50,192
      Lace Front Institute

251
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:54,962
      Chi Chi, your group       
       is Shady Bitches.        

252
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,597
      Y'all the bad girls       

253
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,165
 from the Lake Titicaca Academy 

254
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,467

          and Waffles.          

255

           [laughter]           

256
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:06,704
       All right, ladies,       
    it's time to pick teams.    

257
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,273
Cynthia, who will you           
choose first?                   

258
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,842
     - Bob The Drag Queen.      
    - All right, all right.     

259
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,976
    - Chi Chi, you're next.     

260
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,044
         - Acid Betty.          

261
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:18,080
         - It don't get         
       shadier than this.       

262
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,314
        - Derrick Barry.        

263
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,349
        - Oh, thank God         
   I did not get picked last.   

264
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,385
         - Thorgy Thor.         
            - Whoo!             

265
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,286
  Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yow.  

266
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:28,022
            - Laila.            
            - Laila.            

267
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:29,423
           [laughter]           

268
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,859
        - Let's go with         
     Dax ExclamationPoint.      

269
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:33,459
        - Yay, my turn.         

270
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:36,094
           - Robbie.            

271
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:39,431
   - That means that Kim Chi    
   and Naomi Smalls are left.   

272
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,166
  - Sorry, Kim, but I'm gonna   
     have to go with Naomi.     

273
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:46,570
  - Which of course means that  
Kim Chi goes to Cynthia's team. 

274
00:10:46,572 --> 00:10:47,570
             - Wah.             

275
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:49,004
          <i> It's okay.</i>           

276
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:52,374
   I wouldn't want me either.   

277
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:53,842
      - Ladies, this week       

278
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:55,209
       you've got to use        
         your charisma,         

279
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:57,578
       uniqueness, nerve,       
           and talent           

280
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,880
      to chorally gratify       
       me and the judges.       

281
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:03,650
           Gentlemen,           
      start your engines,       

282
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:06,118
  and may the best woman win.   

283
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,220
           [cheering]           

284
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:09,722
         <i> - Oh, my God.</i>         

285
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,289
 <i> Kim Chi's a horrible dancer.</i>  

286
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,824
         She's so bad.          

287
00:11:12,826 --> 00:11:15,594
      How is she gonna get      
 through this dance challenge?  

288
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:19,297
- So, girls, like,              

289
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,698
we're gonna, like,              
take one, pass it down.         

290
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,866
     The pressure of being      
        a team captain,         

291
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:27,202
      it--it can be a lot,      
   but I've done choreography   

292
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:30,272
  for the girls back at home.   
          I got this.           

293
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:32,073
      - I think we should       
get some choreography together. 

294
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,008
- Let's just worry about that   
when in time comes.             

295
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,309
Don't--don't confuse yourself.  

296
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,044
We need to know                 
where you come in first.        

297
00:11:37,046 --> 00:11:38,245
            - I think after this
                       we should

298
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:39,612
                   put something
          together just in case.

299
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:40,947
      - Don't get scared.       
       - I'm not scared.        

300
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,448
I'm just trying to be prepared. 
        - I know, but--         

301
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,217
 - I'm not gonna be unprepared  
      because of you, boo.      

302
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:47,786
    - I can sense that Acid     
        definitely wants        

303
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:51,656
    to be the group leader,     
    but it ain't happening.     

304
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:52,990
We need to learn                
where we come in first.         

305
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,591
     - Fine, but we got to      
     start doing something.     

306
00:11:54,593 --> 00:11:56,560
          We can't just sit here
    sitting here learning words.

307
00:11:56,562 --> 00:11:58,795
    <i> - I've known Betty for,</i>    
       <i> like, ten years,</i>        

308
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:01,297
  and sometimes because Betty   
        is so artistic,         

309
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:03,666
       she gets away with       
    being a fucking asshole.    

310
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,101
  - Let's go from the beginning.

311
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,736
          "Oh, really,          
      is that all you got?      

312
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:08,903
       What about this?"        

313
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:10,037
- Is that what                  
you're gonna be doing?          

314
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,271
         - "Lake, Lake,         
       Titi, Titi, Titi."       

315
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,271
             Yeah.              
- No, you're gonna be out there.

316
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,073
        - But the rest--        
          - Whatever.           

317
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:15,674
- Well, we should probably      
set it instead of "whatever."   

318
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,376
Let's get beyond "whatever."    

319
00:12:21,613 --> 00:12:23,479
- Okay.                         

320
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:24,846
  <i> - Acid Betty is an asshole,</i>  

321
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:26,881
       <i> and she knows it,</i>       
       <i> and she loves it,</i>       

322
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:29,149
   and that's why she doesn't   
       work in New York.        

323
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:31,151
      <i> She's so demanding</i>       
     <i> and mean to everyone</i>      

324
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,019
       <i> that nobody wants</i>       
       <i> to work with her.</i>       

325
00:12:33,021 --> 00:12:34,453
    You're gonna be shamed.     

326
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:37,890
   You're gonna be put down,    
    so, Chi Chi, good luck.     

327
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,358
        <i> - Coming up...</i>

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,959
          Cynthia Lee.          
         - Hi, RuPaul.          

329
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,260
- What's the name               
of your group?                  

330
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,695
           - My name            
        of my group is--        

331
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:48,798
- You got to look at a paper    
to get the name of your group?  

332
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,266
    - Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.     

333
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,867
- Now, Chi Chi,                 
you're the leader.              

334
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,068
How are you navigating          
all these strong personalities? 

335
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,003
       - I'm finding them       
    a little bit difficult.     

336
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,705
             - Oh.              
            - Yeah.

       - Formations, formations.

339
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,714
        - One, two, three, four.

340
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,582
         - I like that roll back
             and sit in the hip.

341
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,184
            - Yeah.             
         - That's cool.         

342
00:13:12,186 --> 00:13:14,953
 This week's maxi challenge is  
 an a cappella lip-sync battle.

         <i> Oh, my gosh,</i>

  Basically we're putting out   
        "Bitch Perfect."        

346
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:23,292
- Here we go, and pat,          
pat, pat-pat-pat.               

347
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:24,494
Let me see y'all do it.         

348

     - Bam, bam, bam, bam.      

349
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,063
          Uh-uh, y'all look like
                flailing fishes.

350
00:13:28,065 --> 00:13:29,364
- Well, "pat, pat,              
pat-pat-pat,                    

351
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,099
"pat, pat, pat-pat-pat"         
was the original rhythm.        

352
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,600
          - No, ma'am.          

353
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:36,270
  It's pat, pat, pat-pat-pat,   
     pat, pat, pat-pat-pat.     

354
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:39,506
                     - Switch it
           to something simpler.

355
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:40,506
    - That's so simple too.     

356
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:43,075
I can't even get any simpler.   

357

           but girl,            
   these girls cannot dance.    

359
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:49,613
          Boom, boom.           

360
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:50,814
- Wait, we're now--             
we're robot-ing.                

361
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,048
        - Okay, simple.         

362
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,452
          One, two, three, four,
            turn and down, down.

363
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:57,752

00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,222
   get your visual in my head   
       so I can have it.        

366
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:04,625
     - Do it, bitch, do it.     
- Three, four, five, six, seven.

367
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:06,092
          - That's it.          
 - One, two, three, four, five. 

368
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:07,593
         - No, five, six, seven,
           eight is just a turn.

369
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,028
        Don't move on five, six,
            seven, eight at all.

370
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,963
        - We should change it if
               you can't get it.

371
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:12,330
         What the eff?          
          It's simple.          

372
00:14:12,332 --> 00:14:14,899
  One, two, three, four, turn.  

373
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,667
- One, two,                     
three, four,                    

374
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,669
five, six, seven, eight.        

375
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,237
          - Is that--           
           - Got it.            

376
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,738
The hands weren't the same,     
but fuck it.                    

377
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,139
We got to move on.              

378
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,440
You ready?                      

379
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:28,076
¶ One shot, one shot            
of adrenaline, adrenaline ¶     

380
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:29,010
                 - I don't know.

381
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:31,812
       - We're doing it.        
        It's happening.         

382
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,246
       - All right, girl.       

383
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,881
  Can you just give me a shot,  
       and I'll flip out?       

384
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,449
       - I'll do the second one.

385
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,716
- And I'll punch you            
in the face--boom!              

386
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:39,618
- See, you trying to get        
out of the choreography.        

387
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,286
Bitch, you trying to do comedy. 
     - I can do all of it.      

388
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:43,053
If we're standing there,        
"One shot,"                     

389
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:45,455
     five beats of silence,     
          it's boring.          

390
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:46,789
- I don't want you to do        
that punch thing.               

391
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,090
   I just want you to, like--   

392
00:14:48,092 --> 00:14:49,458
            - Okay.             

393
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,559
  Chi Chi does not get funny,   

394
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:53,528
<i> and I'm, like, a comedy queen,</i> 
         <i> so I'm like,</i>          

395
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,862
     <i> "Okay, you know what?</i>     

396
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,064
    I'm gonna do it anyway.     

397
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:57,131
      I don't care, bitch,      
        it'd be funny."         

398
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:58,599
                    - All right,
             so shall we move on

399
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,833
                and do it again,
   or do you want to stand here?

400
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:02,167
        - We'll get it.         

401
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,902
         <i> - Oh, my God.</i>         

402
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,337
     <i> These bitches getting</i>     
         <i> on my nerves.</i>         

403
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,306
 They getting on my nerves now. 

404
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,742
- All right, Lady Bitches,      
are you ready?                  

405
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,378
       - Kim, I feel like you're
         the one who is kind of,

406
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,779
       like, nerdy and not cool.

407
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,282
            - Yeah.             

408
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:20,016
         Regina George.         
     - I'm the ringleader.      

409
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,019
- I think you should be,        
like, her kid sister.           

410
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,488
                - You do exactly
              whatever she does,

411
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,656
                just not as good
                 as she does it.

412
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,890
- Aw, Laila's my impersonator.  

413
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:31,425
          That's cute.          
            - Yeah.             

414
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,226
      - My biggest concern      
       is that I'm gonna        

415
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:35,594
    fade into the background    
         comparatively          

416
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:36,829
    <i> to all the other girls,</i>    

417
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,098
        <i> so I'm not sure</i>        
      <i> about playing the,</i>       

418
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,634
   like, little sister, like,   
     wannabe Derrick Barry,     

419
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:45,437
 'cause I probably wouldn't be  
 the best Britney impersonator. 

420
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:49,473
- Look at this                  
giant fucking heel.             

421
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:51,141
            - Yeah.             
      - Those are so cute.      

422
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:53,609
 - Bitch, I hope y'all can dance
         in them high-ass heels.

423
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:55,777
              You need something
                 this size, hon.

424
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,913
 - That's like a--four inches.  
          - No, ma'am.          

425
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,714
- Have you ever, guys,          
been in proper shows before     

426
00:15:59,716 --> 00:16:02,216
where you have to learn         
choreography and stuff?         

427
00:16:02,218 --> 00:16:04,318
        - When I was a kid, yes.
                Like, for years.

428
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,718
- Just--oh,                     
when you were younger.          

429
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,219
So you don't really             
know how to, like,              

430
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:09,488
just focus                      
and get it done?                

431
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:10,723
         - Yeah, I do.          

432
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:11,856
- 'Cause we're                  
talking about shoes.            

433
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,691
I would love to,                
like, save the time             

434
00:16:13,693 --> 00:16:14,992
and figure out                  
what we're doing.               

435
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,392
This is how                     
the group's gonna down.         

436
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:17,393
"So what'd you guys do?"        

437
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,527
"Well, we spent time talking    

438
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:19,694
about how comfortable           
these shoes were."              

439
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:20,828
    - We're not going down.     
             - No.              

440
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,329
   - My worry with this group   

441
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,698
  is that I might be the only   
    one that's gonna give it    

442
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,600
  and the other girls are just  
 gonna take me down with them.  

443
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:30,635
   <i> Chi Chi needs to step up</i>    
     <i> and get us together.</i>      

444
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:33,438
So we all know                  
our lip syncs somewhat?         

445
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,438
Like, the words?                

446
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,805
             - Ish.             
           - Mm-hmm.            

447
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:37,173
- I think that's gonna be       
the most important part         

448
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,474
so when we meet the             
choreographer                   

449
00:16:38,476 --> 00:16:41,309
we can kind of just take        
in what he's saying.            

450
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,409
You're, like,                   
looking at me like              

451
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:43,844
I'm Charlie Brown's teacher.    

452
00:16:43,846 --> 00:16:46,513
Wah, wah, wah, wah,             
wah, wah, wah.                  

453
00:16:46,515 --> 00:16:49,081
Wah, wah, wah,                  
wah, wah, wah, wah.             

454
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:51,182
          You're done?          
      - No, I'm not done.       

455
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,517
            Definitely not done.

456
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,485
         I just want to be good.

457
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,220
        My biggest fear         
       in this challenge        

458
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:58,489
    <i> is these girls flopping</i>    

459
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:00,257
         and me having          
        to take the fall        

460
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:01,391
       for my whole team.       

461
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:05,993
      - Hey, kitty girls.       

462
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:08,162
           - Hey, Ru.           
            all: Hi!            

463
00:17:08,164 --> 00:17:09,830
          - How are my          
     little treble makers?      

464
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:11,832
    - We're working it out.     
            - Yeah.             

465
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,967
         - Cynthia Lee.         
         - Hi, RuPaul.          

466
00:17:13,969 --> 00:17:15,201
- What's the name of your group?

467
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:17,937
           - My name            
        of my group is--        

468
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:22,941
- You've got to look at a paper 
to get the name of your group?  

469
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,976
         Lady Bitches.          
         - Yes, ma'am.          

470
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,810
- So what--                     
did you have a strategy         

471
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,312
in choosing these ladies?       

472
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,380
                - Actually, yes,
           'cause I got dancers.

473
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,915
        I got the comedians one,

474
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,550
     the actors, makeup artists.

475
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:36,985
        - Now, Kim Chi,         
 this is a lip-sync challenge.  

476
00:17:36,987 --> 00:17:38,353
   Are you a lip-sync artist?   

477
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:40,021
        - I think I am,         
     but my biggest problem     

478
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:42,490
 is sometimes when I lip-synch  
     my lisp comes through.     

479
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,359
    - I'm not mad at a lisp.    
            - Yeah.             

480
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:47,361
           - In fact,           
     I'm partial to a lisp.     

481
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:49,496
 My empire was built on a lisp. 

482
00:17:49,498 --> 00:17:50,997
           - Really.            
         - Absolutely.          

483

Are you familiar with           
the movie "Pitch Perfect?"      

484
00:17:52,934 --> 00:17:55,067
        - I've never heard of it
   or even know what it's about.

485
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:56,602
    I was probably in Korea     
          at the time.          

486

        six months ago.

491
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:07,376

492
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,011

You weren't shining through.

     I'm gonna come forward     
        and be present.         

500

    a lot of girls say that.    

501
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:28,258
There's more strategy           
to it than that.                

502

        "I'm here too."         

506
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:39,134

519

 - Are there any shady bitches  
         in this group?         

520
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:01,850
Oh, okay, well,                 
there you have it.              

521
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:03,751
Now, Chi Chi,                   
you from Louisiana.             

522
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:05,285
       - Louisiana, baby.       

523
00:19:05,287 --> 00:19:06,919
  - You know, both my parents   
      are from Louisiana.       

524
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,653
      - Yes, I enjoy being      
        a country queen.        

525
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:10,221

you're the leader.              

529
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,460
How are you navigating all      
of these strong personalities?  

530
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:21,563
       - I'm finding them       
    a little bit difficult.     

531
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:22,997
- Really?                       
Are you for real?               

532
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:24,431
                 - I'm for real.

533
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,733
          I've never had to deal
    with such big personalities,

534
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,034
     and back home I'm the star,

535
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,703
             so to get this many
              stars in one room?

536
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:33,338
          It's just, like, girl.

537
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,641
- Okay, well, is anybody        
afraid of choreography?         

538
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,175
                           - No.

539
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,310
      She didn't like my comedic
    take of a punch in the face.

540
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,477
          - No, ma'am.          

541
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:41,678
              - I'm always been,
                like, putting in

542
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,813
               my little comedic
                 chime in there,

543
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,047
    but you're shutting it down,

544
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,348
                 so I'm probably
              gonna do it anyway

545
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,117
                   regardless of
              what Chi Chi says.

546
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,051
      - I prefer the whole thing
            to be choreographed.

547
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:51,285
         I feel safer,          

548
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:52,585
                     and I think
          I'm having a hard time

549
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:55,121
    getting her to actually     
      put down the steps.       

550
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,488
- Maybe you should be           
more of a tyrant.               

551
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,489
    - I cannot be a tyrant.     

552
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:58,856
    That's not in my blood.     

553
00:19:58,858 --> 00:20:02,560
  I think I'll give that part   
         to Acid Betty.         

554
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:03,728
             - Oh.              
            - Yeah.             

555
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:06,697
      - Are you a tyrant,       
          Acid Betty?           

556
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:08,131
- No, I haven't showed          
that side yet.                  

557
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:09,532
            - Girl.             

558
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,565
      - She's the leader,       
       so I'm letting her       

559
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,733
    kind of make decisions.     

560

            but no."            

601
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,115
- You guys are Lady Bitches,    

602
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,582
and so I really want            
to present you guys             

603
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,419
dancing very up,                
very, you know,                 

604
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,954
trained and very precise        
and classic.                    

605
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,655
         So let's start         
      from the top, yeah?       

606
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:11,393
  One, two, three, four, five,  
       six, seven, eight.       

607
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:14,395
        One, two, three,        
        four, five, six.        

608
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:15,997
     Let me see you do it.      

609
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:20,868
One, two, three, four,          
five, six, seven, eight.        

610
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,970
           - Kim Chi            
     is the worst dancer...     

611
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:24,971
           - Whoops.            

612
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:26,405
   - In "Drag Race" history.    

613
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:29,742
             both:              
     One, two, three, four.     

614
00:22:29,744 --> 00:22:31,076
<i> - We're not doing crazy stuff.</i> 

615
00:22:31,078 --> 00:22:33,044
     We're not pirouetting      
       and back flipping.       

616
00:22:33,046 --> 00:22:35,045
          Step, touch,          

617
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,447
      <i> and not only that,</i>       
     <i> it's the first move.</i>      

618
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,548
         We're fucked.          

619
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,717
- One, two, three,              
four, five, six.                

620
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,051
All right,                      
something's going on here.      

621
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,485
              - Yeah, I'm, like,
        losing it with the arms.

622
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:45,986
        I'm trying to--         
            - Yeah.             

623
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:47,987
Don't think about the arms.     
Let's get the feet first.       

624
00:22:47,989 --> 00:22:49,655
    - Okay, right first or--    
         - Right first.         

625
00:22:49,657 --> 00:22:53,059
  - It's profoundly difficult   
 to try and do all these steps  

626
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,793
<i> but then also I have to think,</i> 

627
00:22:54,795 --> 00:22:56,661
      "I need to stand out      
        as a character."        

628
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:58,696
- Let me have you two           
do it by yourselves.            

629
00:22:58,698 --> 00:22:59,796
           - Don't be--one, two.

630
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:01,031
        - Okay, can we--        
       can we start over.       

631
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,365
         I'm so sorry.          

632
00:23:02,367 --> 00:23:03,499
           All right.           
          - Don't be--          

633
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,067
             both:              
     Jealous of my boogie.      

634
00:23:05,069 --> 00:23:07,803
- Three, four, five.            
Okay, listen.                   

635
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:10,371
One, two, three, four.          

636
00:23:10,373 --> 00:23:11,906
All right, and right now        
you guys are doing              

637
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:14,275
three, four, five, six,         
so on one, two.                 

638
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,443
 - One, two, three, four, five. 

639
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:17,910
             <i> What?</i>             

640
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:19,679
 It's like I'm learning English 
        all over again.         

641
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:20,779
- Don't be afraid.              

642
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:22,047
Right now you're                
looking like this.              

643
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:23,615
     Let it go, all right?      
          Here we go.           

644
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:25,984
Five, six, seven.               
Don't be--                      

645
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:27,451
   - ¶ Jealous of my boogie ¶   

646
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:30,120
              ¶ Don't be jealous
                  of my boogie ¶

647
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,521
- Whoa.                         

648
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:32,522
            - Uh-oh.            

649
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:33,856
            - Are you all right,
                        sweetie?

650
00:23:33,858 --> 00:23:35,090
       <i> - Kim Chi falls,</i>        

651
00:23:35,092 --> 00:23:38,092
       and just my heart        
    drops out of my cuckoo.     

652
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:39,092
          <i> Oh, my God.</i>          

653
00:23:39,094 --> 00:23:40,092
- Kim Chi,                      
are you sure you want           

654
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,093
to keep doing it in heels?      

655
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:42,094
            - 100%.             
            - Okay.             

656
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,662
    - She need to nail this     

657
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:47,832
 because if she falls tomorrow  
  in front of the judges live,  

658
00:23:47,834 --> 00:23:49,500
    we are completely done.     

659
00:23:51,069 --> 00:23:53,035
- Shady Bitches in the house.   

660
00:23:53,037 --> 00:23:54,670
           all: Hey.            

661
00:23:54,672 --> 00:23:58,140
    <i> - So we're working with</i>    
   <i> the fabulous Jamal Sims.</i>    

662
00:23:58,142 --> 00:24:01,176
   <i> I'm ready for him to just</i>   
    <i> give us some structure</i>     

663
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:04,045
     to this dance routine      
    that I've come up with.     

664
00:24:04,047 --> 00:24:05,246
- Show me what you got.         

665
00:24:05,248 --> 00:24:07,315
    - Well, what about this?    

666
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:09,684
           Tit, tit,            
     ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah,      

667
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:11,418
        Titi, Titicaca.         

668
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,418
                   Seven, eight.

669
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,419
              Ay.               
            all: Ay!            

670
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:14,420
             - Ay.              
           all: What!           

671
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,420
             - Ay.              
            all: Oh!            

672
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:16,420
             - Ay.              
          all: Bitch.           

673
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,689
     all: La-la, la, la-la.     

674
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:19,856
- All right, guys.              

675
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,592
So you guys have                
a lot of good ideas,            

676
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,293
and I think we could kind of    
clean 'em up and make 'em...    

677
00:24:25,295 --> 00:24:26,427
          - Together.           
          - Cohesive.           

678
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:28,061
    "Cohesive" is the word.     

679
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:30,830
  - I'm so happy that we have   
  a little bit of choreography  

680
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:33,332
       like I suggested--       
            Chi Chi,            

681
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:35,000
 <i> because now we're with Jamal,</i> 

682
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:37,468
       and he's actually        
    using our choreography.     

683
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,069
- I want to see                 
"Give me one shot."             

684
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:40,370
     - ¶ Give me one shot ¶     

685
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:41,637
            - Okay.             
         - ¶ One shot ¶

      - ¶ Of adrenaline ¶       

687

688
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:45,440
you might want to               
be careful with that.           

689
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,707
             - Yeah, that's what
              I said right away.

690
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:47,541
          I was like,           
  "Why are we shooting drugs?"  

691
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:48,608
         I don't know.          

692
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,410
      - Give me one shot,       

693
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:53,546
and then from here,             
grab each other's arms

00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:36,376
¶ Give me one shot,             
one shot ¶                      

718
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:38,277
¶ Uh, uh, of adrenaline ¶       

719
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,845
There you go.                   
Next.                           

720
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:41,880
         - ¶ One shot ¶         
        - Click, click,         

721
00:25:41,882 --> 00:25:45,550
      - ¶ Of a sexy, sexy,      
       sexy adrenaline ¶        

722
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:46,950
- All right.                    

723
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:50,853
¶ Give me one shot, one shot,   
uh, uh, of adrenaline ¶         

724
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:52,388
All right.                      
Here we go.                     

725
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,823
¶ Give me one shot,             
one shot ¶                      

726
00:25:54,825 --> 00:25:56,257
Uh, uh.                         

727
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,691
        - Look--I keep--        
     sorry, one more time.      

728
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:00,026
         Sorry, sorry.          
      The look, I forgot.       

729
00:26:00,028 --> 00:26:01,026
- Let it go.                    

730
00:26:01,028 --> 00:26:02,027
Just shake it off,              
shake it off.                   

731
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,094
    - I'm thinking too much.    

732
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:04,462
   - We'll come back to you.    

733
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:06,463
Your turn.                      
Five, six, seven.               

734
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,065
¶ Give me--                     
shot, one shot ¶                

735
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,533
click, clack--                  
¶ Of adrenaline ¶               

736
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,768
¶ Uh-huh, adrenaline ¶          

737
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,703
              Ah!               
      - Oh, she's a diva.       

738
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:16,804
    - It's about commitment.    

739
00:26:16,806 --> 00:26:18,805
Sweat flying, hair dripping,    

740
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:20,606
whatever, it doesn't matter.    

741
00:26:20,608 --> 00:26:24,410
     As long as you commit,     
      you're in it, okay?       

742
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:25,778
        How you feeling?        

743
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,279
   - I mean, I'm shaky on it,   
          but I got to          

744
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,779
   go through it a few times    
        and I'll get it.        

745
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,246
        Like, that's how I work.

746
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:31,815
           Like, I don't pick up
       choreography super quick.

747
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:33,449
          Like, if I think while
     I'm dancing, I can't do it.

748
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:35,084
           I get really in here,

749
00:26:35,086 --> 00:26:37,352
      and it just becomes       
      all fucked up, so...      

750
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:40,055
      - Dax's attitude was      
    really off-putting to me    

751
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,890
just because it didn't feel like
  she really wanted to do it.   

752
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,925
     <i> I think there's a lot</i>     
      <i> of insecurity there</i>      

753
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:46,560
         when it comes          
      to the choreography.      

754
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:47,894
   You have to push yourself    
          on this one,          

755
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:48,861
      'cause we don't have      
         a lot of time.         

756
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:49,928
           - Totally.           

757
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,362
         It means a lot         
       for me to be here,       

758
00:26:51,364 --> 00:26:52,930
   <i> and I don't want to have</i>    
    <i> to go back to Savannah</i>     

759
00:26:52,932 --> 00:26:55,365
  and find some shitty day job  
      picking up dog shit       

760
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:59,402
or, you know, just doing random 
  sporadic shows in dive bars.  

761
00:26:59,404 --> 00:27:01,170
      Like, I want to take      
        over the world,         

762
00:27:01,172 --> 00:27:03,705
   <i> and I want to do it now,</i>    
<i> and I want to do it with drag,</i> 

763
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,474
    so I will make it work.     

764
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:08,776
    - I'm a little nervous,     
       I'm not gonna lie.       

765
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:10,244
                   We didn't get
      all the way through, so...

766
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,578
    <i> - So rehearsal is over,</i>    

767
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,381
    and the Lady Bitches are    
  in a little bit of trouble.   

768
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:19,118
  <i> Kim Chi seems a little too</i>   
 <i> in her head to pull this off,</i> 

769
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,752
  <i> and nobody's expecting her</i>   

770
00:27:20,754 --> 00:27:22,287
        <i> to be the best</i>         
      <i> dancer in the room,</i>      

771
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,621
    but she's thinking that,    

772
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:25,456
           and that's           
     what's messing her up.     

773
00:27:25,458 --> 00:27:28,292
- I remember the choreography,  
but my only problem is hitting, 

774
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:29,993
like, the points, like,         
at the right time, so.          

775
00:27:29,995 --> 00:27:30,994
    - We can help you with that.

776
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:32,094
         - One thing we can't do

777
00:27:32,096 --> 00:27:33,428
                    is teach you
           that rhythm in a day.

778
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,695
- Yeah.                         

779
00:27:34,697 --> 00:27:36,897
            - But you can, like,
    just live in your character,

780
00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:38,231
                       and like,
              if you're offbeat,

781
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,732
    just be like--what happened?

782
00:27:40,734 --> 00:27:42,201
     - 'Cause then you're funny.

783
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,535
       - We're all, like,       
        rallying around.        

784
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,969
     We're like, "Kim Chi,      
       you can do this,"        

785
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:48,406
  but Kim Chi is being really,  
     like, down on herself.     

786
00:27:48,408 --> 00:27:51,041
- I just really wish, like,     
I could hit the beats.          

787
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:52,276
           - They said last week

788
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:53,810
                  that they love
             that you're a nerd.

789
00:27:53,812 --> 00:27:55,245
                 You'll be fine.

790
00:27:59,383 --> 00:28:02,584
       <i> - I am so nervous</i>       
        <i> about tomorrow.</i>        

791
00:28:02,586 --> 00:28:05,319
      I really don't want       
     to let my group down.      

792
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:07,454
       Everyone has been        
      super, super helpful      

793
00:28:07,456 --> 00:28:09,122
guiding me through all of this. 

794
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:10,589
 <i> I'm not ready to go home yet.</i> 

795
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:13,659
 I have so many looks and ideas 
    that I want to showcase.    

796
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:18,863
              Man.              

797
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:26,803
   I'm just gonna try my best   
    and do what I always do.    

798
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:30,840
- Uh, uh-uh, uh.                

799
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,242
Uh, uh-uh, and stop.            

800
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,276
You all okay?                   

801
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,677
         You guys hot?          
          - Yes, very.          

802
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,345
- That means we're              
putting in work.                

803
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:38,579
        - Yeah, that'd be great.

804
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:39,946
             - Yeah, do you have
               any paper towels?

805
00:28:39,948 --> 00:28:41,881
     - Y'all need to focus.     
            - What?             

806
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:43,482
     - Y'all need to focus      
      on what y'all doing.      

807
00:28:43,484 --> 00:28:44,784
             - I think I'm doing
           a good job, you know.

808
00:28:44,786 --> 00:28:46,285
- Yeah, do a good job           
or you're gonna have to         

809
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:48,153
lip-synch against me.           

810
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:49,788
   - Why do you think you're    
    gonna be in the bottom?     

811
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,955
- 'Cause I'm the team captain.  

812
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:52,289
They're gonna say,              
"The team captain               

813
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,290
"should have had everybody      

814
00:28:53,292 --> 00:28:54,424
at her's--at her level."        

815
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:55,458
- Yes, but I'll be              
the first person                

816
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,358
to be like, "Mm,                
she did a fucking               

817
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,293
good job as captain."           

818
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,362
- 'Cause she gonna              
throw me under the bus.         

819
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:03,562
          - Fuck yeah,          
    I'll be honest as fuck.     

820
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:05,064
           She was--            
         - What'd I do?         

821
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:07,032
   - You were like, "At least   
  I can lip-synch for myself.   

822
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:08,232
I know I was gonna be all that."

823
00:29:08,234 --> 00:29:09,299
      That's what you did.      

824
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:10,433
- But then I                    
pulled it back together.        

825
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:11,800
          - She pulled          
    the team together, yeah.    

826
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:13,369
                   - You can say
            that if they ask me.

827
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:14,502
- Exactly.                      

828
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:17,071
        - Betty is being        
          so negative,          

829
00:29:17,073 --> 00:29:19,573
 and, like, counterproductive,  
   and I'm like, "Oh, my God.   

830
00:29:19,575 --> 00:29:20,907
      This is so stupid."       

831
00:29:20,909 --> 00:29:21,975
- It is what it is.             

832
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:22,909
Just hope you're not            
lip-synching                    

833
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:24,910
against me, darling.            

834
00:29:24,912 --> 00:29:26,878
       <i> I don't have time</i>       
     <i> to coddle this girl.</i>      

835
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,147
       We're both on this       
     competition together.      

836
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:32,250
    When that bus comes by,     
   I'm gonna throw her first.   

837
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:34,718
      I told her that too.

        <i> - Coming up...</i>         

839
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:38,453

  comfortable in my own skin.   

840
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:39,888
      I'm still a virgin.       

841

            - What?

        - Shady Bitches.        

846
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:56,669
    - Ooh, we're gonna kill     
       the Shady Ladies.        

847
00:29:56,671 --> 00:29:58,770
       - Oh, my goodness.       

848
00:29:58,772 --> 00:29:59,804
     - Time to get styling.     

849
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:01,539
   <i> Today's elimination day.</i>    

850

  <i> performing for the judges.</i>   

851
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:05,943
       I'm very nervous.        

852
00:30:05,945 --> 00:30:07,744
            How did your group's
                   rehearsal go?

853
00:30:07,746 --> 00:30:09,145
        - It went well.         

854
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:10,912
         I was nervous          
       as fuck at first,        

855
00:30:10,914 --> 00:30:13,447
but I have to understand        
that everybody's not a dancer,  

856
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:16,183
and everybody's not gonna       
catch on as fast as me,         

857
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:18,285

frustrated about it.            

858
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:19,919

 got it, I'm like, "Oh, my God.

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,623
         This is, like,         
     my biggest nightmare."     

861
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,190
               - Everybody's not
                  a born dancer.

862
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:28,191
            - Yeah.

     like, feel the music.      

869
00:30:41,904 --> 00:30:44,004
    I used to be 350 pounds.    

870
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:45,171
             - 350?             
            - Jesus.            

871
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:46,405
            - Yeah.             

872
00:30:46,407 --> 00:30:49,474

873
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:52,277
   - Obviously, like, I'm not   
    as fat as I was before,     

874
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,444
      but the fat kid is,       
       like, still in me.       

875
00:30:53,446 --> 00:30:54,678

00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,812
          - Yeah, no,           
   it never goes away, girl.    

877
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,447
        Come on, proof.         
        This is me fat.         

878
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:59,481

     completely different.      

880
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:02,950
      - I was chubby too.       

881
00:31:02,952 --> 00:31:04,918
     I was always aware it,     
  like, when I was kid, like,   

882
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,220
       'cause other kids        
  made it very apparent like,

884
00:31:08,689 --> 00:31:11,189
  Not only are you super gay,   
    but you're also chubby."

 <i> When I was an overweight kid,</i> 

886

        <i> and that power,</i>

890
00:31:20,197 --> 00:31:21,562

   people never sit next to you.

896

906

907

          Is that a possibility?

909

  - Not really; I don't know.   
          - Yes, yes.           

910

911
00:31:57,857 --> 00:31:59,089
Acid said she was               
hitting on you and you--        

912
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:00,223
       - I was, hard too.       

913
00:32:00,225 --> 00:32:01,390

        you were being friendly.

      You got to own that.      

921

922
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,706

            like in Puerto Rico?

923
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,073

924
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,908

             in Puerto Rico too.

925
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,908
             - Yes.

              Girl, I had a gun,
                  a .38 Special.

929

          - Yes, God.           

930
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:35,982
I was a little gangbanger.      

931

Girl, I've seen people shot.    

932
00:32:37,718 --> 00:32:38,950
         - Oh, my God.          

933
00:32:38,952 --> 00:32:41,986
- I've smelled, like,           
the smell of brains.            

934
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,255
   - Chi Chi, that is insane.   

935
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,058
- Girl, to see my mom           
break down and cry?             

936
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,459
That was it.                    

937
00:32:50,461 --> 00:32:52,994
Plus my daddy beat the hell     
out of me for having a gun.     

938
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:55,063
       - Good parenting.

939

         - I can't even imagine.

940
00:32:56,299 --> 00:32:58,532
- When I tell you               
I come from the streets,        

941
00:32:58,534 --> 00:32:59,767
I'm not kidding.                

942
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,467
People don't make it            
where I come from.              

943
00:33:01,469 --> 00:33:02,969
                - Were you doing
                     all of that

944
00:33:02,971 --> 00:33:04,469
       with gangs and everything
          'cause you were trying

                to hide the fact
              that you were gay?

946
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:08,406
- Yeah,                         
'cause I was afraid             

947
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:10,742
        of what my mom,         
     my brother, you know,      

948
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,376
  everybody would think of me.

     <i> why I was acting out.</i>     

951
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,981
         It was because         
       I wasn't being me.       

952
00:33:18,983 --> 00:33:20,582
   <i> When I finally came out,</i>    

953
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,750
     it was a turning point     
          in my life.           

954
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:23,851
    I could have been dead.     

955
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:25,752
  I could have been locked up,  

956
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,120
but I'm here with you girls.    

957

I feel blessed,                 
bitch, to be here.              

958
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,390
   - And you're a role model,   
           an example

            with you            
      is when you'll fall,      

1318
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,170
       you'll fall hard.        

1319
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:57,839
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

1320
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:02,376
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

1321
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:04,945
            Ladies,             
     you represent the tops     

1322
00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:07,113
  and the bottoms of the week.  

1323
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:09,682
       Now it's time for        
     the judges' critiques.     

1324
00:48:09,684 --> 00:48:12,284
           First up,            
         Laila McQueen.         

1325
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:14,819
        - Hello, Laila,         
  I think the dress is pretty.  

1326
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:17,454
        The problem is,         
       you're lost in it.       

1327
00:48:17,456 --> 00:48:19,022
   The hair is flat and long.   

1328
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,924
Everything's being pulled down. 
    You can see none of you.    

1329
00:48:21,926 --> 00:48:23,693
        - And as far as         
     the performance goes,      

1330
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:27,062
  I feel like I wasn't getting  
      much of the comedy,       

1331
00:48:27,064 --> 00:48:30,499
    especially with the big     
   personalities around you.    

1332
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:32,968
      - Up next, Kim Chi.       

1333
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,637
          - I can tell          
     that you cannot dance,     

1334
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:39,707
    but on the positive side    
 of that, you chose a character 

1335
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,575
          to cover up           
     that you can't dance,      

1336
00:48:41,577 --> 00:48:42,976
         and it worked.         

1337
00:48:42,978 --> 00:48:44,510
         - I don't mind         
      that you can't dance      

1338
00:48:44,512 --> 00:48:48,847
       because this look        
      is, like, fantastic.      

1339
00:48:48,849 --> 00:48:52,184
Yeah, I just want to smell you. 
             - Mmm.             

1340
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:54,753
      - I do get concerned      
        about your walk.        

1341
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:56,888
      I'm not sure anymore      
      that it's a choice.       

1342
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,923
   It's very stiff, darling.    

1343
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:00,157
   Give yourself over to it.    

1344
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,292
   Allow yourself to have fun   
        on this runway.         

1345
00:49:02,294 --> 00:49:04,460
        - How do you say        
  "sissy that walk" in Korean?  

1346
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:06,094
      - [speaking Korean]       
      - [speaking Korean]       

1347
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:08,329
          - Pow, pow.           
        - Yes, yes, yes.        

1348
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:09,464
      - [speaking Korean]       

1349
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:11,299
  Up next, Louisiana glamour.   

1350
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:13,500
         Bayou country.         
        Chi Chi DeVayne.        

1351
00:49:13,502 --> 00:49:16,335
         - Hey, y'all.          
           - [laughs]           

1352
00:49:16,337 --> 00:49:18,104
      - It's funny 'cause       
    we shot "Pitch Perfect"     

1353
00:49:18,106 --> 00:49:20,939
        in Baton Rouge,         
so you make me feel really good 

1354
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,474
     by hearing your voice.     

1355
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:26,411
   - Your performance today,    
 you turned it completely out.  

1356
00:49:26,413 --> 00:49:27,812
   - That got them ass clap.    

1357
00:49:27,814 --> 00:49:29,079
      You know, they'd be       
     throwing some dollars      

1358
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:30,447
     at your ass real fast.     

1359
00:49:30,449 --> 00:49:34,050
      - You definitely are      
       my new trap queen.       

1360
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:36,552
         - So tonight,          
       I think you look--       

1361
00:49:36,554 --> 00:49:40,790
   for lack of a better term,   
         sort of basic.         

1362
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:42,391
          Look around.          

1363
00:49:42,393 --> 00:49:45,661
    This is a crew that came    
      to play this season.      

1364
00:49:45,663 --> 00:49:48,296
    - But she looks amazing.    
     I love the red dress.      

1365
00:49:48,298 --> 00:49:50,331
         - "Dreamgirls"         
is one of my favorite musicals, 

1366
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:54,301
 so right now you're giving me  
   Sheryl Lee Ralph realness.   

1367
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:56,536
 - I don't really have anything 
   negative to say about you.   

1368
00:49:56,538 --> 00:49:57,703
          - Thank you.          

1369
00:49:57,705 --> 00:50:00,739
           [laughter]           

1370
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:03,408
     - Next up, Acid Betty.     

1371
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,410
     - What I really loved      
     about what you did is,     

1372
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:07,511
 you were really a team player. 

1373
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:08,846
       You were concerned       
     about everybody else,      

1374
00:50:08,848 --> 00:50:10,380
and I appreciate stuff like that

1375
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,482
        because it lets         
       me know you care.        

1376
00:50:12,484 --> 00:50:14,650
   - So I love the headpiece.   

1377
00:50:14,652 --> 00:50:16,418
      I love the body art.      

1378
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,554
   I'm not getting the train.   

1379
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:21,555
     - I just like looking      
       at you right now.        

1380
00:50:21,557 --> 00:50:23,023
        - I like looking        
       at you right now.        

1381
00:50:23,025 --> 00:50:25,258
            - Ha-ha!            
      - Do you need this?       

1382
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,625
        - You can't see         
        this right now,         

1383
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:29,694
     but he's got a fistful     
       of Jergens lotion.       

1384
00:50:29,696 --> 00:50:31,795
           [laughter]           

1385
00:50:31,797 --> 00:50:33,630
      - The one thing I'm       
  concerned about with you is,  

1386
00:50:33,632 --> 00:50:35,331
you're setting the bar so high. 

1387
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,499
     I'll be waiting to see     
   if you can keep raising it   

1388
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,102
    'cause when you'll fall,    
       you'll fall hard.        

1389
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,103
     - Is that a challenge,     
           Michelle?            

1390
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,573
 - It's always a challenge when 
 I throw it out there, darling. 

1391
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:47,709
           - Next up,           
     Dax ExclamationPoint.      

1392
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,943
      - I love your face.       
        I love the hair.        

1393
00:50:49,945 --> 00:50:53,180
   Something about the bottom   
   of the dress is not done.    

1394
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:55,681
    - One thing I did notice    
        from last week.         

1395
00:50:55,683 --> 00:50:57,649
        I have an issue         
       with your padding.       

1396
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:59,584
      It almost gives you       
         a quadru-butt.         

1397
00:50:59,586 --> 00:51:00,885
Just look at it.                

1398
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:02,119
       - The performance,       

1399
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:04,354
      I really wanted you       
       to get that hood,        

1400
00:51:04,356 --> 00:51:07,423
      like, uh, you know,       
and it--and it still never came,

1401
00:51:07,425 --> 00:51:08,992
       and in rehearsals        
        you were saying,        

1402
00:51:08,994 --> 00:51:11,360
   "Oh, yeah, I'll do it when   
   I figure out these steps."   

1403
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:14,029
    - I am not a classically    
  trained dancer in the least,  

1404
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:16,164
  and like, I was also trying   
 to kind of create a character  

1405
00:51:16,166 --> 00:51:18,699
  while also thinking too much  
 about other stuff, and like--  

1406
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:19,966
- You just got to go.           

1407
00:51:19,968 --> 00:51:23,369
    Whether you do it wrong     
      or whatever, commit.      

1408
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,970
          - All right,          
          Thorgy Thor.          

1409
00:51:24,972 --> 00:51:27,306
          - As far as           
       the dance portion,       

1410
00:51:27,308 --> 00:51:29,708
    you're one of the people    
 I didn't have to worry about.  

1411
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,676
      - What I love about       
        the jumpsuit is,        

1412
00:51:31,678 --> 00:51:34,012
       it's smart because       
   you said, "You know what?    

1413
00:51:34,014 --> 00:51:35,579
     "At a movie premiere,      
         everybody else         

1414
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,180
          "is gonna do          
      some glamorous gown.      

1415
00:51:37,182 --> 00:51:39,282
     I'm gonna do something     
 that's representative of me,"  

1416
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:43,352
But you wear your eyes so black 
 that I'm losing your eyeballs, 

1417
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:45,053
        so blend it out.        

1418
00:51:45,055 --> 00:51:47,188
- I'll take that challenge, yes.

1419
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,656
      - Thank you, ladies.      

1420
00:51:48,658 --> 00:51:51,225
         Now, while you         
       untuck backstage,        

1421
00:51:51,227 --> 00:51:54,360
           the judges           
     and I will deliberate.     

1422
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:58,131
  Now, just between us altos,   
       what do you think?       

1423
00:51:58,133 --> 00:51:59,999
        <i> Laila McQueen.</i>         

1424
00:52:00,001 --> 00:52:02,300
- She stood out to me because   
she was the most improved.      

1425
00:52:02,302 --> 00:52:03,502
I would have never thought      

1426
00:52:03,504 --> 00:52:05,203
she could last through          
the whole performance.          

1427
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,072
     - But I didn't really      
  remember what she had done.   

1428
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,306
        - The only thing        
      I remember about her      

1429
00:52:09,308 --> 00:52:11,641
                     is the mole
             underneath her eye,

1430
00:52:11,643 --> 00:52:13,509
   so I don't think that's good.

1431
00:52:13,511 --> 00:52:14,743
    - You know what this is?    

1432
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:17,579
        This season has         
   very strong personalities.   

1433
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:18,713
    She's out of her league.    

1434
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:21,548
- I know she has a fire in her, 

1435
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,450
       but she gonna have       
     to step her pussy up.      

1436
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:25,151
             - Oh.              
           - Kim Chi.           

1437
00:52:25,153 --> 00:52:28,153
  - Talk about somebody who's   
  the polar opposite of Laila.  

1438
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:30,155
You can't stop                  
looking at Kim Chi.             

1439
00:52:30,157 --> 00:52:32,891
- When I see her on the runway, 
       I was blown away,        

1440
00:52:32,893 --> 00:52:37,162
    <i> but it's so weird to me</i>    
 <i> that she can't walk in heels.</i> 

1441
00:52:37,164 --> 00:52:38,463
   - It could become a trend.   

1442
00:52:38,465 --> 00:52:42,466
     New York Fashion Week,     
    a sasquatch, a Godzilla.    

1443
00:52:42,468 --> 00:52:43,868
       You better Kim Chi       
        that walk, girl.        

1444
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,269
             - Yes.             

1445
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:48,605
   - But my fear for Kim Chi    
     is that she is a look.     

1446
00:52:48,607 --> 00:52:51,173
 Because she's had such success 

1447
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:53,108
   with who she is visually,    

1448
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,143
        <i> she hasn't had</i>         
   <i> to deliver a performance.</i>   

1449
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:59,380
 She just had to be really cute 
 and kind of nerdy and anime-y, 

1450
00:52:59,382 --> 00:53:01,615
      but I think there's       
    a personality in there.     

1451
00:53:01,617 --> 00:53:04,151
 I just want her to unleash it  
      and let us have it.       

1452
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:05,819
       - Chi Chi DeVayne.       

1453
00:53:05,821 --> 00:53:08,588
    - Tonight on the stage,     
     did she play it safe?      

1454
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:10,623
              Yes.              
     - I loved her outfit.      

1455
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,024
         It just seemed         
  very classic and beautiful,   

1456
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:14,959
           and as far           
    as the performance goes,    

1457
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:17,761
       she really slayed        
        the other girls.        

1458
00:53:17,763 --> 00:53:19,629
       - I mean, really.        
             - Yes.             

1459
00:53:19,631 --> 00:53:22,164
        - She was doing         
     her neck ghetto style      

1460
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:25,467
   upside down while twerking   
    and not missing a word.     

1461
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,401
   Honey, I was ready to make   
     the Louisiana Purchase     

1462
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:29,804
         one more time.         
           [laughter]           

1463
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:30,971
          Acid Betty.           

1464
00:53:30,973 --> 00:53:32,973
         - Energy-wise,         
      a complete standout.      

1465
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:35,475
      I particularly loved      
        her runway look         

1466
00:53:35,477 --> 00:53:38,578
        <i> with that weird</i>        
    <i> fiber optic spiderweb.</i>     

1467
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,246
             - Yes.             
- Everything I love about drag. 

1468
00:53:40,248 --> 00:53:41,247
   - Look, it wasn't perfect.   

1469
00:53:41,249 --> 00:53:42,581
There was weirdness at the back 

1470
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,349
   that looked like draperies   
       being dry-cleaned.       

1471
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:46,317
      - I would have liked      
       if that dress just       

1472
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,552
   did the see-through thing    
        all the way down        

1473
00:53:48,554 --> 00:53:51,021
        because it made         
       her bottom heavy,        

1474
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:52,088
     and the color's ugly.      

1475
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,056
             Sorry.             
       - Sorry 'bout it.        

1476
00:53:54,058 --> 00:53:56,258
     Dax ExclamationPoint.      

1477
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,260
    - Tonight on the runway,    
 it just was all wrong for me.  

1478
00:53:59,262 --> 00:54:01,128
     The flower did not go      
        with the dress.         

1479
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,496
     The colors were dull,      

1480
00:54:02,498 --> 00:54:05,164
     and in the performance     
      you literally forgot      

1481
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:06,465
      that Dax was there.       

1482
00:54:06,467 --> 00:54:08,733
     - In "Pitch Perfect,"      
    I know what it felt like    

1483
00:54:08,735 --> 00:54:10,401
 to not be a classical dancer.  

1484
00:54:10,403 --> 00:54:13,070
     It just takes courage      
        to get past it.         

1485
00:54:13,072 --> 00:54:14,538
She don't want to fight for it. 

1486
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,140
        It's like she's the girl
               in the girl group

1487
00:54:17,142 --> 00:54:18,775
         with the Beyoncé in it.

1488
00:54:18,777 --> 00:54:22,077
         Beyoncé only stands out
    because she really wants it.

1489
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,046
      - She's the Farrah.       
           - LaTavia.           

1490
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:26,781
                  - I don't want
               to call no names.

1491
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,783
         - Thorgy Thor.         

1492
00:54:28,785 --> 00:54:30,751
 - She nailed the performance.  

1493
00:54:30,753 --> 00:54:33,087
 She came out in that catsuit.  

1494
00:54:33,089 --> 00:54:34,821
  It was 180 degrees different  

1495
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:36,655
      from the performance      
          personality.          

1496
00:54:36,657 --> 00:54:38,858
    - Just hated the shoes.     
           - Uh-huh.            

1497
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,959
  - They look like ugly shoes.  

1498
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:43,361
          - Well, no,           
    my issue is her makeup.     

1499
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,430
       Two times in a row       
    it's a--two black eyes.     

1500
00:54:46,432 --> 00:54:48,098
        - So, Michelle,         
   what you're saying is that   

1501
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,034
    Thorgy is in an abusive     
 relationship with her makeup.  

1502
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:54,203
             - Yes.             

1503
00:54:54,205 --> 00:54:55,571
           - Silence.           

1504
00:54:55,573 --> 00:54:58,106
     I've made my decision.     

1505
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:00,475
      Bring back my girls.      

1506
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:01,409
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

1507
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,746
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

1508
00:55:06,748 --> 00:55:08,114
- Welcome back, ladies.         

1509
00:55:08,116 --> 00:55:11,116
         Based on your          
  "Bitch Perfect" performance   

1510
00:55:11,118 --> 00:55:14,285
         and your movie         
       premiere eleganza,       

1511
00:55:14,287 --> 00:55:15,553
   I've made some decisions.    

1512
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,625
   Thorgy Thor, you're safe.    

1513
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:22,893
          - Thank you.          

1514
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,027
       - Chi Chi DeVayne,       

1515
00:55:26,029 --> 00:55:28,863
          not only did          
        you turn it out,        

1516
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:31,332
             girl,              
   you turned it upside down.   

1517
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:33,600
  Condragulations, you are the  
winner of this week's challenge.

1518
00:55:33,602 --> 00:55:34,868
             - Wow.             
             - Wow.             

1519
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:37,737
          - For real?           
         - Really, Ru?          

1520
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:41,339
  Chi Chi sucked as a leader.   

1521
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,441
     <i> - I won a challenge.</i>      

1522
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:44,842
 <i> I'm definitely on the radar.</i>  

1523
00:55:44,844 --> 00:55:46,177
  Y'all girls better look out.  

1524
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:48,345
          - You've won          
      a four-night getaway      

1525
00:55:48,347 --> 00:55:51,781

1527
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:59,822
   - So I get to go overseas?   

1528
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:04,359
   - No, New England is here    
     in the United States.      

1529
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,827

00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,295

     you may cross the seas     

1531
00:56:08,297 --> 00:56:10,531
   and join the other girls.    
            - Whoo!             

1532
00:56:13,835 --> 00:56:16,870
         - Acid Betty,          
          you're safe.          

1533
00:56:16,872 --> 00:56:19,071
          - Thank you.

    - Dax ExclamationPoint,     

1535
00:56:21,309 --> 00:56:24,209
     the lack of commitment     
      to your performance       

1536
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:28,880
forces me to put a question mark
        after your name.        

1537
00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:33,051
      I'm sorry, my dear,       
but you are up for elimination.

    <i> that did worse than me,</i>

          and I'm sad,          
 and I'm just pissed about it.  

1540
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:41,192
        - Laila McQueen,        
      in your performance       

1541
00:56:41,194 --> 00:56:44,862
          you got lost          
     in the din and tonic.      

1542
00:56:44,864 --> 00:56:51,035
  Kim Chi, in your performance  
you put your left foot forward. 

1543
00:56:51,037 --> 00:56:53,537
         Both of them.

00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:57,007
         Laila McQueen,

          but you are           
      up for elimination.       

1546

            Kim Chi,            
         you are safe,          

1547
00:57:04,615 --> 00:57:06,482
        and you may join        
        the other girls.

  Two queens stand before me.

00:57:11,889 --> 00:57:13,955
        Prior to tonight        
         you were asked         

1550
00:57:13,957 --> 00:57:15,990
           to prepare

00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:25,199
      Ladies, this is your      
   last chance to impress me    

1553
00:57:25,201 --> 00:57:30,136

       from elimination.

00:57:43,615 --> 00:57:46,949
     I can definitely beat,     
           uh, Laila.           

1560
00:57:46,951 --> 00:57:48,584
    Sorry, I forgot her name    
         for a second.          

1561
00:57:48,586 --> 00:57:50,485
       <i> - I feel the song</i>

         <i> tied with it,</i>         

1563
00:57:52,922 --> 00:57:56,623
 and Dax is kind of lackluster, 
and the song is not lackluster, 

1564
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,258
         <i> so I'm like,</i>

1565
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:08,134
    - All right, here we go.    

1566
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:13,038
           Good luck,           
     and don't fuck it up.

     Dax ExclamationPoint,

        Laila McQueen...        

1617
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:27,148
       Neither one of you       
    survived that lip sync.     

1618
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:31,586
      I must ask you both       
        to sashay away.         

1619
01:00:35,858 --> 01:00:40,159
      - Wait, second time

      - Thank you, ladies.

    You may leave the stage.

1636
01:01:28,633 --> 01:01:30,398
         - Who the fuck         
     is RuPaul talking to?      

1637
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,669
  - Listen, I had to eliminate  
       two queens today.        

1638
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:37,038
   How soon can you get here?   

1639
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,739
            - Fuck.

01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:40,241
     Someone's coming back.
