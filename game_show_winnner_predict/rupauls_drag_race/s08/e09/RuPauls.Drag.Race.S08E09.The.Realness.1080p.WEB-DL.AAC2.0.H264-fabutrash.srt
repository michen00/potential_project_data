       in this challenge,       

150
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:49,217
  because this is going to be   
     the determining factor

   Let's cut, cut, cut, cut.    

395
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,398
       We got a wardrobe

     is really interesting.

     he fisted a coal mine,

   on "The Realness," ladies.   

446
00:13:30,737 --> 00:13:32,837
       It was incredible.       
    - Excuse me, excuse me.

470
00:14:16,804 --> 00:14:19,671
       and it feels like        
  it's our last day of school,  

471
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:22,440
  and we're finding out who's   
    gonna get valedictorian     

472
00:14:22,442 --> 00:14:23,807
         or something.          

473
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,442
  - What do each of you think   
         you've learned         

474
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,277
         about yourself         

475
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,844
  throughout the competition?   

476
00:14:28,846 --> 00:14:30,446
 - I've learned that apparently,

477
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:33,482
I can come off as very arrogant,

478
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:35,683
       but I attribute it       
         to confidence.

           I was like           
      a little chunky kid.      

481
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:40,520
    I was really effeminate.    

482
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:42,388
    I had really dark skin,     

483
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,190
 <i> and kids can be mean to you,</i>  

484
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:46,691

487
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:52,095

  <i> if I don't like my weight,</i>   

491
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,133
     but I think to myself,     
      "I have nice teeth,"      

492
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,735
     and it may just start      
        with one tooth.         

493

664
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,307
   that even today, there are   
     little boys and girls      

665
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:56,110
  who feel they don't fit in.   

666

So I want you to turn back time 

667

672
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,092
      - At four years old.

     - I say, "Hey, girl."      

675
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:23,199
  I would tell myself, "You're  
gonna want to change for others.

676
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:24,666
        Do not do that."        

677
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,968
    I just wanted to be like    
 my brother or like my uncles.  

678
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,604
    I was so different than     
 every other guy in my family.  

679
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:31,773
   I just wanted to blend in    
       and be like them,        

680
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:34,141
    but once I realized how     
     important it really is     

681
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:36,442
           to be me,            
  then I really shone through.  

682
00:21:36,444 --> 00:21:37,610
     And I would also say,

00:21:37,612 --> 00:21:38,811
        "Don't take out

780
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:22,749
        of standing out.        

781
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,084
You have managed to be hilarious
          throughout,           

782
00:25:25,086 --> 00:25:28,587
    and you've also listened    
    to the judges and grown.    

783
00:25:28,589 --> 00:25:29,988
  I see an evolution with you.  

784
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,989
       - Thank you, Bob.        

785
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:31,990
          - Thank you.          

786
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:34,325
  - Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.   

787
00:25:34,327 --> 00:25:36,027
       Ooh, girl, you've        
        come a long way         

788
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:37,728
  from Shreveport, Louisiana.   

789
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,728
        - I heard that.

791
00:25:40,198 --> 00:25:41,763
        - Tonight, is it        
    the most creative thing     

792
00:25:41,765 --> 00:25:43,097
        we've ever seen         
       on the main stage?       

793
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:44,097
              No.               

794
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,732
     But you look stunning,     

795
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:47,166
  and I love the pageant hair.  

796
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:48,800
 It's one of my favorite things 
         in the world,          

797
00:25:48,802 --> 00:25:51,136
      is that pageant hair      
    with the 18 buns on top.    

798
00:25:51,138 --> 00:25:52,703
       - The music video,       
         very nice job.         

799
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:54,705
  <i> That was, like, your moment</i>  
    <i> where you were living,</i>     

800
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,239
     'cause you were, like,     
         in the mirror,         

801
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:58,775
   and you were all done up,    
 and it was just you being you. 

802
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:01,076
   The wind scene, you looked   
       gorgeous in that.        

803
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,511
     <i> - Because you dance,</i>      

804
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:04,847
     you had the fluidity,      
  and you knew just what to do  

805
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:06,248
       on that black box.       

806
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,716
         [all laughing]         

807
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:10,884
        - I have to talk        
  about some of your journey.   

808
00:26:10,886 --> 00:26:15,321
   Your taste level was, um,    
         questionable.          

809
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,189
        - Am I surprised        
       that you're here?        

810
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,124
  Yes, if I had a time machine  
       and came here now,       

811
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:20,125
      I would be shocked,       

812
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:23,194
    but you put in the work,    

813
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:24,395
 and I love a surprise ending.  

814
00:26:24,397 --> 00:26:26,029
    You're like the M. Night    
        Shyama-lama-lan         

815
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:27,264
     of drag queens, right?     

816
00:26:27,266 --> 00:26:28,365
   I didn't see this coming.    

817
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:30,266
- Our little girl has grown up. 

818
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:32,935
   Chi Chi, if I had moisture   
        left in my body,        

819
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:35,103
          I'd probably          
      shed a tear tonight.      

820
00:26:35,105 --> 00:26:36,470
         [all laughing]         

821
00:26:36,472 --> 00:26:37,804
   But I dried up years ago.    

822
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:40,106
   - Yes, everybody knows it.   

823
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,774
      Thank you, Chi Chi.       

824
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:44,376
       Up next, Kim Chi.        

825
00:26:44,378 --> 00:26:48,079
    - Even though we fought     
this awkward body movement thing

826
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:49,680
       this whole season,       

827
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:52,449
     I think you've really      
       gotten to a place        

828
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:53,950
   where you can work it now.   

829
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:56,019
   For avant-garde, you were    
       like a glamorous,        

830
00:26:56,021 --> 00:26:58,720
  Dame-Edna-inspired chicken.   

831
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:00,055
     It was so captivating.     

832
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:02,624
   - And seeing your journey    
       of self-acceptance       

833
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,393
        and your journey        
     to challenge yourself      

834
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:06,294
  has been really impressive.   

835
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,795
     - As a matter of fact,     
    in your entire journey,     

836
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:10,630
I don't think there was one look

837
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,432
     that you didn't kill,      

838
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:14,834
 and tonight is just the cherry 

839
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,669
on top of the hot fudge sundae. 

840
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,970
     Thank you for bringing     
         your artistry          

841
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:21,672
       to the main stage        
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

842
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:23,840
    - Up next, Naomi Smalls.    

843
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,243
     - You look absolutely      
       beautiful tonight.       

844
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,311
  Of course, it's iconic Cher   
            for us,             

845
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,645
  so it makes us super happy.   

846
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,446
          - [as Cher]           
        Snap out of it.         

847
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:32,748
     - You have brought it,     

848
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,182
     <i> and this music video</i>      
       <i> was no exception.</i>       

849
00:27:35,184 --> 00:27:37,284
 - For avant-garde, I want you  
     to look like an alien,     

850
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:39,319
      <i> and that blue look</i>       
     <i> with the white boots</i>      

851
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:40,553
       <i> gave that to me.</i>        

852
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:42,588
- And what I love most about you

853
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,956
      is you're so sweet.       

854
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,625
      - You're that great       
     combination of, like,      

855
00:27:46,627 --> 00:27:48,893
you're a fierce bitch that could
   cut a bitch on the street,   

856
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:51,328
     but you're also, like,     
 a sweet little, like, kitten.  

857
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,330
 I'm so happy to see you here,  
        because I think         

858
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:55,232
      you bring something       
   really special and unique.   

859
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:56,900
   You listened, you worked,    

860
00:27:56,902 --> 00:27:57,901
        and it paid off.        

861
00:27:57,903 --> 00:27:59,268
  - We all have those moments   

862
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,570
   when you decide to, like,    
         bust through.          

863
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:03,338
      I can think of times      
         in my career--         

864
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,539
     it was hearing "No"--      

865
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:06,841
       when I just said,        
          "Fuck y'all.          

866
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:07,842
            I'm in,"            

867
00:28:07,844 --> 00:28:09,376
and there was just a moment here

868
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:11,878
 when you just said, "I am in." 

869
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,615
    - Naomi, to say that you    
      are the surprise...       

870
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:16,916
     it's no exaggeration.      

871
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:19,885
    It's just as surprising     
       as Chi Chi for me.       

872
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:22,520
   This is not the final four   
  that I would have predicted   

873
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:24,755
         the first week         
      in the competition,       

874
00:28:24,757 --> 00:28:27,391
        and you did it,         
       and you earned it.       

875
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:29,359
      - I want to say this      
       to all the girls.        

876
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:31,495
The theme of the winner's circle

877
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:33,063
        is adaptability,        

878
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:34,597
      but at the same time      
          staying true          

879
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,431
 to your own unique frequency,  

880
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:37,833
      and that's the truth      

881
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,167
  not only in this competition  

882
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:41,169
   but in everything in life.   

883
00:28:41,171 --> 00:28:43,537
       Taking those cues        
       from the universe        

884
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,538
       and applying them        

885
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,373
but without losing who you are, 

886
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,173
and each of you represent that, 

887
00:28:48,175 --> 00:28:50,141
       and I am so proud        
        of each of you,         

888
00:28:50,143 --> 00:28:53,945
and that is why you're standing 
      on this stage today.

913
00:29:41,618 --> 00:29:43,517
      and actually getting      
       my hands and feet        

914
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,485
 into the dirt of the community 

915
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:46,786
      and helping it grow,      

916
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:48,754
     because the community      
      has helped me grow,       

917
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,856
and it's made me who I am today.

918
00:29:50,858 --> 00:29:52,390
          - Thank you.          

919
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:54,291
  All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.   

920
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,394
    - I should be America's     
      next drag superstar       

921
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,630
 because I feel like I possess  

922
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,432
          the talent,           
    the willingness to grow,    

923
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,168
    the willingness to take     
         your critiques         

924
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,303
         and apply 'em.         

925
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,337
  I can be funny just as well.  

926
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:10,605
      I can make costumes,      

927
00:30:10,607 --> 00:30:12,506
and I can beat this mug out too.

928
00:30:12,508 --> 00:30:13,573
      I can work a runway.      

929
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:15,041
   I can work a music video,    

930
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:17,109
    and I've just blossomed,    

931
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:18,744
       and I feel like--        
        that I should be        

932
00:30:18,746 --> 00:30:20,144
 America's next drag superstar, 

933
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:21,912
       because I've shown       
        the most growth         

934
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:24,648
       out of--out of all       
        of these girls.         

935
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,683
          - Thank you.          

936
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:27,850
        All right, next.        

937
00:30:27,852 --> 00:30:29,051
            Kim Chi.            

938
00:30:29,053 --> 00:30:30,451
       - Throughout this        
       whole competition,       

939
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,986
    I have shown consistent     

940
00:30:31,988 --> 00:30:33,853
and creative and detailed looks.

941
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:35,654
    I have been professional    
         and courteous          

942
00:30:35,656 --> 00:30:37,522
     throughout this whole      
          experience.           

943
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:39,156
  I have been willing to adapt  
           to myself            

944
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:40,690
   in any situation I am in.    

945
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:43,159
None of the girls will ever come
  up with the stuff that I do.  

946
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,261
  I don't want to be America's  
      next drag superstar.      

947
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:48,096
         I<i> am</i> America's         
      next drag superstar.      

948
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,597
          - Thank you.          
          - Thank you.          

949
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,400
   - All right, Naomi Smalls.   

950
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:55,702
     - I love drag so much.     

951
00:30:55,704 --> 00:30:57,904
  It is what, like, gets me up  
        in the morning,         

952
00:30:57,906 --> 00:31:01,607
     and I have such a need     
      and a want to grow,       

953
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,076
        and I don't like        
      to pigeonhole myself      

954
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,345
     into just being either     
      a stand-up comedian       

955
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:09,581
       or a dancing queen       
        or a look queen.        

956
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:12,550
I want to be able to do anything

957
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:14,184
       and show everybody       

958
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:16,553
    that I can be successful    

959
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,755
         just being me          
      and loving who I am,      

960
00:31:18,757 --> 00:31:21,591
     and that is everything     
      I want in the world.      

961
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:22,592
          - Thank you.          

962
00:31:22,594 --> 00:31:23,592
          - Thank you.          

963
00:31:23,594 --> 00:31:24,926
       - Well, my queens,       

964
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,761
  I think we've heard enough.   

965
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:29,162
  While you untuck backstage,   

966
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:32,499
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

967
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:35,201
      Now, just between us      
       squirrel friends,        

968
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:36,201
       what do you think?       

969
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:37,202
     Now, y'all were doing      

970
00:31:37,204 --> 00:31:38,436
  a lot of praising up there,   

971
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,837
    and these kids have come    
          a long way.           

972
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,404
       I understand that,       

973
00:31:41,406 --> 00:31:43,606
  but I need y'all to get real  
       for the realness.        

974
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:45,207
   You know what I'm saying?    
       - I can get real.        

975
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,574
     - I'll break it down.      
          - You know?           

976
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:48,876
   'Cause, hey, this is still   
         a competition,         

977
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:51,978
          and somebody          
    has to go home tonight.     

978
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,213
      <i> Bob The Drag Queen.</i>      

979
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:56,682
      - Spandex leggings--      
   not so much for best drag.   

980
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,150
       I would have loved       
      to have seen a gown.      

981
00:31:58,152 --> 00:31:59,417
  - The makeup has always been  

982
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:00,552
           not great.           
            - Right.            

983
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:02,253
    - There was some growth     
        with the looks,         

984
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:04,622
  but, you know, if I'm buying  
    a ticket to Bob's show,     

985
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:05,790
    it's not to see glamour.    

986
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:07,257
    It's to be entertained.     

987
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,759
- She's been consistently smart 

988
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:09,926
        with her humor.         

989
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,828
  The Snatch Game was stellar.  
             - Oh.              

990
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,729
         - I also liked         
     the shady politics ad.     

991
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,062
I thought that was really funny.

992
00:32:15,064 --> 00:32:17,598
    - I think my number one     
           Bob moment           

993
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,032
  was "chocolate chip cookie."  

994
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:21,099
  Shut it down in the acting.   

995
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:24,235
   - Really every challenge,    
    Bob rose to the occasion    

996
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:27,304
     and was able to inject     
       Bob The Drag Queen       

997
00:32:27,306 --> 00:32:29,239
      into that challenge.      

998
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,874
       <i> Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>        

999
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,809
 - Look at how far she's come.  

1000
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:34,777
     - She had to lip-sync      
      for her life twice,       

1001
00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:37,980
and she not only saved herself, 
     she, like, killed it.      

1002
00:32:37,982 --> 00:32:39,748
          Like, we had          
   a "come to Jesus" meeting    

1003
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,650
    during "I'm Telling You     
        I'm Not Going."         

1004
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,251
 - The Bitch Perfect challenge. 

1005
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,386
     That was a high point.     

1006
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:46,187
      She was upside down,      
          lip-syncing.          

1007
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:47,354
           - Uh-huh.            
          - Twerking.           

1008
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,189
             - Yes.             
       - I mean, come on.       

1009
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:51,825
      <i> Also, the Book Ball</i>      
        <i> was a shining,</i>         

1010
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:54,127
        glorious moment         
      for Chi Chi DeVayne.      

1011
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:55,794
   <i> - As great as she looked,</i>   

1012
00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:58,964
   looking at the four queens   
      on that stage today,      

1013
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:01,500
         I didn't know          
      if she's as original      

1014
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:02,934
  as the other ones, you know?  

1015
00:33:02,936 --> 00:33:05,069
 Chi Chi I've seen done before. 
           - Mm-hmm.            

1016
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:07,437
- But I'm in love with Chi Chi. 
            - Right.            

1017
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:09,506
   - As a judge, I don't know   
     what to do with that.      

1018
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:10,907
    - She is one of the kids    

1019
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:14,177
   who come from the sort of    
       backwoods of drag.       

1020
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:17,547
     She doesn't have to do     
          the outfits           

1021
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:20,783
   that people in big cities    
        come to expect,         

1022
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,251
    but in this competition,    

1023
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:23,785
   judges wanted to see more,   

1024
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:25,620
    and she delivered more.     

1025
00:33:25,622 --> 00:33:26,754
           <i> Kim Chi.</i>            

1026
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:27,921
      - She can definitely      
          serve a look          

1027
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,155
 better than nobody's business. 

1028
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:30,223
     I loved the Wonderful      

1029
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:31,824
    <i> Wizard of Oz challenge.</i>    
            <i> - Yeah.</i>            

1030
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,959
  <i> - And what she did with the</i>  
<i> stripes, with the little woman,</i>

1031
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,761
    I thought it was really,    
         really smart.          

1032
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,329
  - When she did the Book Ball  

1033
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:40,398
   <i> and created the paper wig</i>   
 <i> out of pink pieces of paper,</i>  

1034
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,665
        it's phenomenal.        

1035
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:43,633
      - My favorite moment      
          with Kim Chi          

1036
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,501
 was the first time I saw her,  

1037
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:48,303
and I thought, "What in the hell
       am I looking at?"        

1038
00:33:48,305 --> 00:33:50,505
 - The interesting thing for me 
   was watching the struggle    

1039
00:33:50,507 --> 00:33:52,206
         of not loving          
    who she is in her skin.     

1040
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,907
    - I kind of went through    
      a very similar thing      

1041
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:55,174
    when I did "Queer Eye."     

1042
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:57,075
     It was like that thing     
       that I was hiding.       

1043
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,210
   It was like, "Oh, my God,    
     you're the queer guy?"     

1044
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:00,411
 Then it was, like, celebrated, 

1045
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,845
        and you're like,        
        "Wait a minute."        

1046
00:34:01,847 --> 00:34:03,780
  I think that's gonna happen   
       with her owning it       

1047
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:05,582
          and saying,           
  "Wait, I'm being celebrated   

1048

     lisp and awkwardness,"     

1049

1051

       and work a crowd?

1054
00:34:16,857 --> 00:34:19,224

1090
