00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,137
<b>We're having a Book Ball.</b>

3
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:06,306
<b>'Cause "Ruvealed"</b>
<b>is fundamental.</b>

4
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:07,941
<b>Am I the first person</b>
<b>who's ever said</b>

5
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,676
<b>anything like this,</b>
<b>ever, to you?</b>

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,245
<b>That has said my makeup</b>
<b>is not good?</b>

7
00:00:11,246 --> 00:00:12,846
<b>I didn't say</b>
<b>your makeup's not good.</b>

8
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,815
<b>It's just not drag.</b>

9
00:00:14,816 --> 00:00:16,283
<b>Escandalo!</b>

10
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:18,519
<b>When's dinner?</b>

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,287
<b>Bob The Drag Queen.</b>

12
00:00:20,288 --> 00:00:21,788
<b>I am not getting "book"</b>
<b>at all.</b>

13
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:22,856
<b>I'm getting "cardboard."</b>

14
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,091
<b>Well,</b>
<b>I'm still wearing books.</b>

15
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,726
<b>I'm just not wearing pages.</b>
<b>Snap.</b>

16
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:27,528
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Derrick Barry.</b>

17
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:29,730
<b>I don't know</b>
<b>that you're at this level.</b>

18
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:31,832
<b>I have seen what you've done</b>
<b>with your eyebrows,</b>

19
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:34,334
<b>but it's going to be a journey.</b>

20
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,669
<b>Kim Chi.</b>

21
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,237
<b>I felt something</b>
<b>from each look</b>

22
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,705
<b><i>and couldn't wait</i></b>
<b><i>for you to come out.</i></b>

23
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,807
<b>It was the artistry</b>
<b>I expect from you.</b>

24
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,609
<b>You are the winner</b>
<b>of this week's challenge.</b>

25
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,645
<b>Thank you, thank you,</b>
<b>thank you.</b>

26
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:48,015
<b>Bob The Drag Queen,</b>
<b>shantay, you stay.</b>

27
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:50,918
<b>Derrick Barry,</b>
<b>sashay away.</b>

28
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,653
<b>Derrick.</b>
<b>Love you, girl.</b>

29
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,542
<b>They better be recycling</b>
<b>them looks.</b>

30
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,277
<b>That's all I'm saying.</b>

31
00:01:03,278 --> 00:01:04,778
<b>All right, girl.</b>

32
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,980
<b>Oh, my God, Derrick's message</b>

33
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,182
<b>is actually surprisingly short.</b>

34
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:09,416
<b>She's a champ.</b>
<b>I like her a lot.</b>

35
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,684
<b>I didn't think I would like her,</b>

36
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:11,685
<b>and I ended up</b>
<b>really liking her.</b>

37
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,621
<b>Yeah, me too.</b>
<b>I did too.</b>

38
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:15,155
<b>Long live Britney.</b>

39
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:17,992
<b>I got to say, being in</b>
<b>the bottom two is an experience.</b>

40
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:20,561
<b>I think Naomi and Kim Chi</b>
<b>know that girl.</b>

41
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:23,430
<b><i>I feel like there's a dent</i></b>
<b><i>in my armor now,</i></b>

42
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,933
<b>but it's time to pick myself up</b>
<b>by my wig straps</b>

43
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,568
<b>and get back in the game.</b>

44
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:28,903
<b>Congratulations, Kim.</b>

45
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:30,204
<b>Congratulations.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

46
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:32,006
<b>I finally won.</b>

47
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,908
<b><i>I feel really good</i></b>
<b><i>about how well I've done,</i></b>

48
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,709
<b><i>but I can't be too secure,</i></b>

49
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,546
<b>because people who won</b>
<b>the challenge the week before</b>

50
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:39,547
<b>have gone home,</b>

51
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:40,981
<b><i>so no one is safe.</i></b>

52
00:01:40,982 --> 00:01:42,983
<b>The judges told me</b>
<b>I have to work on being ugly,</b>

53
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:44,985
<b>and I don't think I know</b>
<b>how to do that.</b>

54
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:48,022
<b>Can you make an ugly face</b>
<b>right now for us?</b>

55
00:01:48,023 --> 00:01:49,190
<b>Can you smudge your makeup?</b>

56
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,724
<b>Like, just rub your hand</b>
<b>across your--</b>

57
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:51,725
<b>Okay, ready?</b>

58
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:53,127
<b>Take the lashes off first.</b>

59
00:01:53,128 --> 00:01:54,728
<b>That's too far.</b>

60
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:55,796
<b>See?</b>
<b>Here I come.</b>

61
00:01:57,098 --> 00:01:58,933
<b>Wait a minute now.</b>

62
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:02,069
<b>There you go.</b>

63
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,271
<b>Be ugly, G.</b>

64
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:08,209
<b>Top freakin'...</b>
<b>all: Four.</b>

65
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,578
<b>You know how close we are?</b>
<b>Mad close.</b>

66
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:12,179
<b>Major.</b>

67
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,915
<b>So now that it's the top four,</b>
<b>the stakes are fucking high.</b>

68
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,083
<b><i>Yes, we're all friends,</i></b>

69
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:18,118
<b>but unfortunately,</b>
<b>someone has to go home.</b>

70
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,453
<b>This is a competition,</b>

71
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:21,088
<b>and I want to be</b>
<b>in the top three.</b>

72
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,693
<b>Bring it on.</b>

73
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,828
<b>Oh, yes, honey,</b>

74
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,563
<b>it has been broughten.</b>

75
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,866
<b>This week,</b>
<b>realness will be served</b>

00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,668
<b>as my girls battle for</b>
<b>the top three spots.</b>

77
00:02:34,669 --> 00:02:37,371
<b>Oh, and, yes,</b>
<b>there will be tears.</b>

78
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:38,706
<b>You're welcome.</b>

79
00:02:38,707 --> 00:02:43,110
<b><i>May the best woman,</i></b>
<b><i>best woman win</i></b>

80
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:45,346
<b><i>Everyone can</i></b>

81
00:02:45,347 --> 00:02:47,681
<b>Are they here</b>
<b>for a spa day?</b>

82
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:49,316
<b>And me without my loofa.</b>

83
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,852
<b>It's the final challenge,</b>
<b>and Ru told us</b>

84
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:54,054
<b>to show up in full face</b>

85
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:56,824
<b>and be ready</b>
<b>to hit the ground running.</b>

86
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,627
<b>Surprise, my top four.</b>

87
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:01,862
<b>God.</b>
<b>Oh.</b>

88
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:04,899
<b>I didn't know you bitches</b>
<b>woke up like this.</b>

89
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,269
<b>I want you to meet</b>
<b>director Jayson Whitmore.</b>

90
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,270
<b>Hello, ladies.</b>

91
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,504
<b>Hi, Jason.</b>
<b>Hey, Jason.</b>

92
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:12,873
<b>Now, Jason has worked</b>
<b>with some of the best</b>

93
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:16,577
<b>drag queens in the world,</b>
<b>like Alaska,</b>

94
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,212
<b>Adore Delano,</b>

95
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:20,381
<b>Kim Kardashian...</b>

96
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,417
<b>And now it's your turn.</b>

97
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:25,686
<b>For your final Maxi Challenge,</b>

98
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:28,522
<b>you'll star</b>
<b>in the official music video</b>

99
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,391
<b>for "The Realness."</b>

100
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:33,227
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>I'm a video ho.</b>

101
00:03:33,228 --> 00:03:34,295
<b>Goals.</b>

102
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:37,898
<b>When it comes</b>
<b>to a music video,</b>

103
00:03:37,899 --> 00:03:39,767
<b><i>it's not Kim Chi's forte.</i></b>

104
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:42,303
<b>I really hope that she can rise</b>
<b>to the challenge.</b>

105
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,405
<b><i>To not make it</i></b>
<b><i>into the top three with Kim--</i></b>

106
00:03:44,406 --> 00:03:46,106
<b>it would just suck.</b>

107
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,742
<b>Now, Jason's vision</b>
<b>includes color,</b>

108
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:51,712
<b>fashion, mirrors,</b>
<b>smoke, drama.</b>

109
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:54,481
<b>Well, basically, just a day</b>
<b>in your normal life.</b>

110
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,650
<b>This is gonna be</b>
<b>interesting.</b>

111
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,754
<b>...serve some</b>
<b>#Top3Realness,</b>

112
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:04,425
<b>because the queen</b>
<b>who gets eliminated tomorrow</b>

113
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:07,595
<b>will be edited out</b>
<b>of the final video</b>

114
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,363
<b>forever.</b>
<b><i>Shade!</i></b>

115
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:11,131
<b>Yes, forever.</b>

116
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:14,235
<b>Churl...</b>
<b>I want to be in the top three.</b>

117
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:15,936
<b>You can't be America's</b>
<b>next drag superstar</b>

118
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:17,404
<b>if you're not in the video.</b>

119
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:20,107
<b>So, Jason, I leave my girls'</b>
<b>charisma, uniqueness,</b>

120
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:21,909
<b>nerve, and talent</b>

121
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,711
<b>in your capable hands.</b>

122
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:26,213
<b>Just keep in mind, we don't</b>
<b>have a whole lot of time,</b>

123
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,516
<b>so we need to get through</b>
<b>our takes really quick, okay?</b>

124
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:32,119
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>
<b>Gentlemen, start your engines,</b>

125
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,322
<b>and may the best woman win.</b>

126
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:36,757
<b>All right.</b>

127
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:39,493
<b>It's so important to do well</b>
<b>in this challenge,</b>

128
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:43,163
<b>because this is going to be</b>
<b>the determining factor</b>

129
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:46,734
<b>if you're going to be</b>
<b>America's next drag superstar.</b>

130
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,235
<b>Yes, Chi Chi, girl,</b>

131
00:04:48,236 --> 00:04:51,172
<b>break it down for us.</b>

132
00:04:51,173 --> 00:04:52,173
<b>Hi.</b>

133
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:53,307
<b><i>So now it's time to shoot</i></b>

134
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:55,376
<b><i>our first video segment</i></b>
<b><i>with Jason.</i></b>

135
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:56,777
<b>I love being in front</b>

136
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:58,946
<b>so I'm super excited</b>
<b>for our music video.</b>

137
00:04:58,947 --> 00:05:00,247
<b>Ladies, welcome to set.</b>

138
00:05:00,248 --> 00:05:03,918
<b>This setup is going to be</b>
<b>all about float-ography.</b>

139
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,354
<b>You guys are required</b>
<b>to serve up a tight lip sync</b>

140
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:10,324
<b>while you appear</b>
<b>like you're floating on air.</b>

141
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,459
<b>You're gonna be playing</b>
<b>to the overhead camera</b>

142
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,061
<b>while you're lying</b>
<b>on your backs.</b>

143
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,697
<b>On their backs?</b>
<b>They got this.</b>

144
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:18,899
<b>I'm looking for the queens</b>
<b>to feel light and airy.</b>

145
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,935
<b><i>They have to pay attention</i></b>
<b><i>to the fabric</i></b>

146
00:05:20,936 --> 00:05:22,703
<b><i>and looking really,</i></b>
<b><i>really beautiful</i></b>

147
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:25,105
<b>while they're floating</b>
<b>back into space.</b>

148
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:27,408
<b>Float-ography.</b>

149
00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:29,143
<b>Action.</b>

150
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:31,111
<b>You're falling</b>
<b>into this whole fantasy world</b>

151
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,980
<b>that Ru is taking you to.</b>

152
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,981
<b>Give me those legs.</b>

153
00:05:33,982 --> 00:05:35,616
<b>Oh, beautiful.</b>

154
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:36,817
<b>I want those nice, beautiful,</b>

155
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:38,719
<b>gorgeous long legs.</b>

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,087
<b>Cut, cut, cut.</b>

157
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,323
<b>Naomi, we want to</b>
<b>really watch those legs, okay?</b>

158
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:44,225
<b>Okay, so, like,</b>
<b>out like this, straight?</b>

159
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:46,327
<b>But we don't want it</b>
<b>to look like you're a board,</b>

160
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,964
<b>so use your abs</b>
<b>so it's more like this, right?</b>

161
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,165
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>So it's pretty, okay?</b>

162
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,034
<b>Uh-oh, she got to work out.</b>

163
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:55,069
<b><i>I'm starting to freak out,</i></b>

164
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,538
<b><i>because my ridiculously</i></b>
<b><i>long legs</i></b>

165
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,508
<b>aren't floating,</b>
<b>and I can barely hold myself up.</b>

166
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:02,610

<b>...about yourself</b>
<b>throughout the competition?</b>

410
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,527
<b>I've learned that apparently,</b>

411
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:26,564
<b>I can come off as very arrogant,</b>

412
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,766
<b>but I attribute it</b>
<b>to confidence.</b>

413
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,668
<b><i>I've not always been</i></b>
<b><i>this confident.</i></b>

414
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,470
<b>I was like</b>
<b>a little chunky kid.</b>

415
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,604
<b>I was really effeminate.</b>

416
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,473
<b>I had really dark skin,</b>

417
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,274
<b><i>and kids can be mean to you,</i></b>

418
00:14:37,275 --> 00:14:39,777
<b><i>so once I found out</i></b>
<b><i>what I was good at</i></b>

419
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,379
<b><i>and I really embraced it,</i></b>
<b><i>people started to like me.</i></b>

420
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,182
<b>Find something about you that</b>
<b>you like, and focus on that.</b>

421
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,184
<b><i>If I don't like my face,</i></b>
<b><i>if I don't like my skin,</i></b>

422
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,419
<b><i>if I don't like my weight,</i></b>

423
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,221
<b>but I think to myself,</b>
<b>"I have nice teeth,"</b>

424
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,823
<b>and it may just start</b>
<b>with one tooth.</b>

425
00:14:52,824 --> 00:14:54,892
<b>"Look at that tooth.</b>
<b>That's a nice tooth, man."</b>

426
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,694
<b><i>And then once you can accept</i></b>
<b><i>that little thing</i></b>

427
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,697
<b>about yourself, you can just</b>
<b>accept you for who you are.</b>

428
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,932
<b>Preach, Mama.</b>
<b>Preach.</b>

429
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:04,235
<b>I can't walk in heels,</b>
<b>I can't dance,</b>

430
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,470
<b>and I have a lisp.</b>

431
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,405
<b><i>To be honest,</i></b>
<b><i>you could be overweight,</i></b>

432
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,108
<b>you could have a lisp,</b>
<b>you could have jacked-up teeth,</b>

433
00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:12,977
<b><i>but you too can turn it around.</i></b>

434
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,812
<b>You know, people just, like,</b>
<b>like me for who I am</b>

435
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:16,347
<b>and I shouldn't try to be</b>
<b>anybody else.</b>

436
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,916
<b>First impression of Kim Chi,</b>
<b>I thought she was</b>

437
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,751
<b>very talented,</b>
<b>'cause I already knew of Kim Chi</b>

438
00:15:20,752 --> 00:15:22,553
<b>before I got here,</b>

439
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,855
<b>already impressed</b>
<b>with her, and--</b>

440
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,157
<b>And then all that changed.</b>

441
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,125
<b>No, but, like,</b>
<b>Kim is amazing.</b>

442
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:29,994

<b>She's America's next</b>
<b>drag panda star.</b>

448
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,176
<b>...how much I hated</b>
<b>where I was from</b>

449
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,111

450
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,979
<b>I never, ever thought</b>
<b>I was funny.</b>

451
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,582

00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:30,347
<b>I'd probably shed a tear...</b>
<b>Happy judges?</b>

501
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:31,949
<b>I gotta see this.</b>

502
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:34,802
<b>Welcome back, racers.</b>

503
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,170
<b>Let's hit the runway.</b>

504
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,873
<b>Serve looks</b>
<b>and break 'em down.</b>

505
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,896
<b>Welcome to the main stage</b>

506
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,798
<b>of "RuPaul's Drag Race."</b>

507
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,434
<b>Tonight, it's just family.</b>

508
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:09,804
<b>This week, we challenged</b>
<b>our top four queens</b>

509
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,574
<b>to star in the official</b>
<b>music video of my song,</b>

510
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:15,042
<b>"The Realness,"</b>

511
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:19,614
<b>and tonight, they're ready</b>
<b>to make us gag,</b>

512
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,784
<b>decked out in their</b>
<b>very best drag.</b>

513
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,019
<b>Gentlemen,</b>
<b>start your engines,</b>

514
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,289
<b>and may the best woman win.</b>

515
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,059
<b>Like I said, no small talk,</b>
<b>let's get to it.</b>

516
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,662
<b>Up first,</b>
<b>Bob The Drag Queen.</b>

517
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:37,165
<b>Not to be confused</b>
<b>with Bob the barista.</b>

518
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,933
<b>No foam.</b>

519
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:40,835
<b><i>This is it.</i></b>
<b><i>This is the final runway,</i></b>

520
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,170
<b><i>so I wanted to wear a tuxedo</i></b>

521
00:18:42,171 --> 00:18:43,771
<b><i>and do a feminine version</i></b>
<b><i>of it,</i></b>

522
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:46,841
<b><i>so I'm wearing this crazy,</i></b>
<b><i>sequined jacket.</i></b>

523
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:49,010
<b><i>This is quintessential</i></b>
<b><i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i></b>

524
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,946
<b>Foxy lady.</b>
<b>Outta sight.</b>

525
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:54,682
<b>Mrs. PG.</b>
<b>Pass it on.</b>

526
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,151
<b>Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

527
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,487
<b>Miss DeVayne, if you're nasty.</b>
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

528
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:01,155
<b>Serving opulence.</b>

529
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,424
<b>She owns everything.</b>

530
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,893
<b>And she's got</b>
<b>the receipts.</b>

531
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,463
<b><i>I have big buns in my head.</i></b>

532
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:10,298
<b><i>To me, it just screams</i></b>
<b><i>"best drag."</i></b>

533
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,033
<b><i>I'm trying to show the judges</i></b>

534
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:15,002
<b><i>that I've gotten over</i></b>
<b><i>all of these obstacles</i></b>

535
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:17,905
<b><i>that I have gone through,</i></b>
<b><i>and I am worthy of this.</i></b>

536
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,006
<b>Oh, which way are you going?</b>

537
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:20,341
<b>That way.</b>
<b>Oh, that way.</b>

538
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:21,943
<b>Apparently, she goes</b>
<b>both ways.</b>

539
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,177
<b>Oh!</b>

540
00:19:23,178 --> 00:19:24,712
<b>Kisses.</b>
<b>Mm.</b>

541
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:28,015
<b>If you like it, then you</b>
<b>should've put a bun on it.</b>

542
00:19:28,016 --> 00:19:29,717
<b>Okay, are you ready</b>
<b>for Kim Chi?</b>

543
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:32,720
<b>I'm hungry.</b>
<b>Magnificent Maleficent.</b>

544
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:35,423
<b>That's a cock-a-doodle-doo.</b>

545
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,458
<b><i>I'm wearing a feather corset</i></b>

546
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,494
<b><i>covered in goose</i></b>
<b><i>and pheasant feathers,</i></b>

547
00:19:39,495 --> 00:19:41,829
<b><i>and I'm feeling like</i></b>
<b><i>a dark, evil princess</i></b>

548
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,232
<b><i>who came here to destroy</i></b>
<b><i>my competition.</i></b>

549
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:45,766
<b>She's working that walk,</b>
<b>Michelle.</b>

550
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,268
<b>She is.</b>
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

551
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,237
<b>Only took till the finale.</b>

552
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,139
<b>Well, kimchi gets better</b>
<b>with a little time.</b>

553
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,207
<b>It does; it's--actually,</b>
<b>usually the next day,</b>

554
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,442
<b>it tastes a lot better.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>

555
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,945
<b>"The Raven," Edgar Allan Ho.</b>

556
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,914
<b>Ha ha ha!</b>

557
00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:01,849
<b>Are you ready</b>
<b>for Naomi Smalls?</b>

558
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,252
<b>Ooh, dark lady.</b>

559
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,454
<b>The notorious Twiggy Smalls.</b>

560
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,889
<b>Uh-huh.</b>
<b>Yes.</b>

561
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,158
<b>Well, she's also serving</b>
<b>a little Kendall Jenner.</b>

562
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,225
<b>She is, yeah.</b>

563
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,360
<b><i>I am showing the judges</i></b>

564
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,295
<b><i>that I'm not relying on sequins</i></b>

565
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,298
<b><i>and rhinestones</i></b>
<b><i>to zhuzh up my outfit.</i></b>

566
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,734
<b><i>This is Naomi Smalls glamour</i></b>
<b><i>to a T.</i></b>

567
00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:23,137
<b><i>I refuse to blend in.</i></b>
<b><i>I want to be the star.</i></b>

568
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,940
<b>The beat goes on,</b>
<b>and so do those legs.</b>

569
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:27,742
<b>Thanks for Cher-ing.</b>

570
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,912
<b>Yes, gypsies,</b>
<b>tramps, and weaves.</b>

571
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:33,648
<b>Oh, yes,</b>
<b>be-weave that.</b>

572
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,484
<b>Ladies, here</b>
<b>at "RuPaul's Drag Race,"</b>

573
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:40,188
<b>we have the luxury</b>
<b>of celebrating who we are,</b>

574
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:42,457
<b>but we must never forget</b>

575
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,393
<b>that even today, there are</b>
<b>little boys and girls</b>

576
00:20:45,394 --> 00:20:48,196
<b>who feel they don't fit in.</b>

577
00:20:48,197 --> 00:20:50,465
<b>So I want you</b>
<b>to turn back time</b>

578
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,668
<b>and share the wisdom</b>
<b>you have today</b>

579
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,038
<b>with the child you were then.</b>

580
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,340
<b>So Bob The Drag Queen...</b>

581
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,577
<b>Okay, y'all might want</b>
<b>to have a tissue ready.</b>

582
00:21:02,578 --> 00:21:04,846
<b>This is you...</b>
<b>That is me.</b>

583
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,415
<b>At four years old.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>

584
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,384
<b>What do you have to say</b>
<b>to little Christopher?</b>

585
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:13,121
<b>I say, "Hey, girl."</b>

586
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:15,289
<b>I would tell myself, "You're</b>
<b>gonna want to change for others.</b>

587
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,024
<b>Do not do that."</b>

588
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,393
<b>I just wanted to be like</b>
<b>my brother or like my uncles.</b>

589
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:21,696
<b>I was so different than</b>
<b>every other guy in my family.</b>

590
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,965
<b>I just wanted to blend in</b>
<b>and be like them,</b>

591
00:21:23,966 --> 00:21:26,334
<b>but once I realized how</b>
<b>important it really is</b>

592
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,703
<b>to be me,</b>
<b>then I really shone through.</b>

593
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,737
<b>And I would also say,</b>

594
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,005
<b>"Don't take out</b>
<b>that student loan</b>

595
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,540
<b>freshman year of college."</b>

596
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,643
<b>"Just pay out of pocket</b>
<b>like you did the rest of it,"</b>

597
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:37,745
<b>because it's still haunting me</b>
<b>to this day.</b>

598
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,248
<b>Okay, now,</b>
<b>that's news you can use.</b>

599
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,683
<b>...Chi Chi DeVayne,</b>
<b>this is you...</b>

600
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:43,818
<b>Cute headband.</b>

601
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:45,186
<b>At six years old.</b>

602
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:48,322
<b>What do you have to say</b>
<b>to little Zavion?</b>

603
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:50,892
<b>I would tell</b>
<b>little Zavion Davenport</b>

604
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,028
<b>that "It doesn't matter</b>
<b>where you're from</b>

605
00:21:54,029 --> 00:21:55,396
<b>"and how you grew up--</b>

606
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,898
<b>"the neighborhood</b>
<b>you grew up in.</b>

607
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,068
<b>"That has nothing to do</b>
<b>with how far you can go.</b>

608
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,739
<b>"Never be ashamed</b>
<b>of how you walk, talk,</b>

609
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,477
<b>because that is going to be</b>
<b>the key to your success."</b>

610
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:10,545
<b>Very sweet.</b>

611
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,747
<b>Thank you, Chi Chi.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

612
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:16,784
<b>Kim Chi, this is you</b>
<b>at three years old.</b>

613
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,386
<b>Aww.</b>
<b>Aww.</b>

614
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:21,389
<b>What do you have to say</b>
<b>to little Sang?</b>

615
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,191
<b>"Hi, Sang,</b>
<b>when you grow up,</b>

616
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:25,126
<b>"you're going to experience</b>
<b>a lot of different cultures.</b>

617
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:28,196
<b>"People might shame you</b>
<b>for being too different</b>

618
00:22:28,197 --> 00:22:30,698
<b>"and not fitting in</b>

619
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:31,999
<b>"At times,</b>

<b>"you're trapped</b>

621
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,336
<b>"and you're trapped in a place</b>

622
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:37,638
<b>"You can't get out, and you--</b>

623
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:40,274
<b>"at times, you're gonna want to</b>

<b>"or even running away.</b>

625
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,011
<b>"But I just wanted</b>

<b>"the things</b>

00:24:14,436 --> 00:24:17,371
<b>You mother-tucking earned it,</b>

661
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,675
<b>but in very different ways.</b>

662
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:23,511
<b>Now it's time</b>
<b>for the judges' critiques.</b>

663
00:24:23,512 --> 00:24:24,512
<b><i>Coming up...</i></b>

664
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,713
<b>These kids have come a long way,</b>

665
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,483
<b>but somebody has to</b>
<b>go home tonight.</b>

666
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:29,817
<b><i>?</i></b>

667
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:32,053
<b>Really?</b>
<b>For real, Tennille.</b>

668
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,221
<b>Be right back.</b>

669
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:36,903
<b>Now here come the judges.</b>

670
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:40,707
<b>Ladies, now it's time</b>
<b>for the judges' critiques.</b>

671
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,510
<b>First up,</b>
<b>Bob The Drag Queen.</b>

672
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:45,411
<b>You can really dance.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

673
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:48,081
<b>You come to life</b>
<b>when you use dance moves.</b>

674
00:24:48,082 --> 00:24:49,616
<b>And you had</b>
<b>such great elegance</b>

675
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:50,750
<b><i>and length to your body.</i></b>

676
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:51,951
<b><i>You made it look fabulous,</i></b>

677
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:53,920
<b><i>and I was like,</i></b>
<b><i>"Wow, Bob The Drag Queen</i></b>

678
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:55,588
<b>is giving us some glamour."</b>

679
00:24:55,589 --> 00:24:56,856
<b>Tonight, on the runway,</b>

680
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:58,525
<b>because we've seen leggings</b>
<b>a lot from you,</b>

681
00:24:58,526 --> 00:25:00,860
<b>I wish it would have just</b>
<b>gone that extra notch</b>

682
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:01,928
<b>to do a gown.</b>

683
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:03,997
<b>I was sort of torn</b>
<b>on the leggings,</b>

684
00:25:03,998 --> 00:25:05,398
<b>which, by the way, is what</b>
<b>I would do to those leggings</b>

685
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,399
<b>if I tried to put 'em on.</b>

686
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,535
<b>Okay, break it down,</b>
<b>Miss Ross.</b>

687
00:25:08,536 --> 00:25:10,703
<b>...this is a really</b>
<b>good place for your drag.</b>

688
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:11,938
<b>Let's talk about your journey.</b>

689
00:25:11,939 --> 00:25:13,006
<b>You've managed to do</b>
<b>a really good job</b>

690
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:14,207
<b>of standing out.</b>

691
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,609
<b>You have managed to be hilarious</b>
<b>throughout,</b>

692
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,113
<b>and you've also listened</b>
<b>to the judges and grown.</b>

693
00:25:20,114 --> 00:25:21,848
<b>I see an evolution with you.</b>

694
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,516
<b>Thank you, Bob.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

695
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:25,852
<b>Up next,</b>
<b>Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

696
00:25:25,853 --> 00:25:27,554
<b>Ooh, girl,</b>
<b>you've come a long way</b>

697
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:29,255
<b>from Shreveport, Louisiana.</b>

698
00:25:29,256 --> 00:25:32,058
<b>I heard that.</b>

699
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,927
<b>Tonight, is it</b>
<b>the most creative thing</b>

700
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:35,061
<b>we've ever seen</b>
<b>on the main stage?</b>

701
00:25:35,062 --> 00:25:37,263
<b>No.</b>
<b>But you look stunning,</b>

702
00:25:37,264 --> 00:25:38,631
<b>and I love the pageant hair.</b>

703
00:25:38,632 --> 00:25:40,466
<b>It's one of my favorite things</b>
<b>in the world,</b>

704
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:42,669
<b>is that pageant hair</b>
<b>with the 18 buns on top.</b>

705
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,237
<b>The music video,</b>
<b>very nice job.</b>

706
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,239
<b><i>That was, like, your moment</i></b>
<b><i>where you were living,</i></b>

707
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,707
<b>'cause you were, like,</b>
<b>in the mirror,</b>

708
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:50,310
<b><i>and you were all done up,</i></b>
<b><i>and it was just you being you.</i></b>

709
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:52,612
<b>The wind scene,</b>
<b>you looked gorgeous in that.</b>

710
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:54,080
<b><i>Because you dance,</i></b>

711
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:56,382
<b>you had the fluidity,</b>
<b>and you knew just what to do</b>

712
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:57,784
<b>on that black box.</b>

713
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:02,422
<b>I have to talk</b>
<b>about some of your journey.</b>

714
00:26:02,423 --> 00:26:06,860
<b>Your taste level was, um,</b>
<b>questionable.</b>

715
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,728
<b>Am I surprised</b>
<b>that you're here?</b>

716
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,663
<b>Yes, if I had a time machine</b>
<b>and came here now,</b>

717
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:14,901
<b>I would be shocked,</b>
<b>but you put in the work,</b>

718
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:16,135
<b>and I love a surprise ending.</b>

719
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:17,570
<b>You're like the M. Night</b>
<b>Shyama-lama-lan</b>

720
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:19,772
<b>of drag queens...</b>
<b>If I had a gag reflex,</b>

721
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,641
<b>I'd be gagging.</b>

722
00:26:21,642 --> 00:26:24,477
<b>Chi Chi, if I had moisture</b>
<b>left in my body,</b>

723
00:26:24,478 --> 00:26:26,646
<b>I'd probably</b>
<b>shed a tear tonight.</b>

724
00:26:28,115 --> 00:26:31,651
<b>But I dried up years ago.</b>
<b>Yes, everybody knows it.</b>

725
00:26:31,652 --> 00:26:33,319
<b>Thank you, Chi Chi.</b>
<b><i>Shade!</i></b>

726
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,922
<b>Up next, Kim Chi.</b>

727
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:39,626
<b>Even though we fought</b>
<b>this awkward body movement thing</b>

728
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:41,461
<b>this whole season,</b>

729
00:26:41,462 --> 00:26:44,063
<b>I think you've really</b>
<b>gotten to a place</b>

730
00:26:44,064 --> 00:26:45,498
<b>where you can work it now.</b>

731
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:47,567
<b>For avant-garde, you were</b>
<b>like a glamorous,</b>

732
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:49,636
<b>Dame-Edna-inspired chicken.</b>

733
00:26:49,637 --> 00:26:51,638
<b>Yes, very that.</b>

734
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,174
<b>And seeing your journey</b>
<b>of self-acceptance</b>

735
00:26:54,175 --> 00:26:55,942
<b>and your journey</b>
<b>to challenge yourself</b>

736
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:57,844
<b>has been really impressive.</b>

737
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,346
<b>As a matter of fact,</b>
<b>in your entire journey,</b>

738
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,182
<b>I don't think there was one look</b>

739
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:03,983
<b>that you didn't kill,</b>

740
00:27:03,984 --> 00:27:06,386
<b>and tonight is just the cherry</b>

741
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:08,221
<b>on top of the hot fudge sundae.</b>

742
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:10,523
<b>Thank you for bringing</b>
<b>your artistry</b>

743
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:12,525
<b>to the main stage</b>
<b>of "RuPaul's Drag Race."</b>

744
00:27:12,526 --> 00:27:15,128
<b>Everybody</b>
<b>loves everybody!</b>

745
00:27:15,129 --> 00:27:17,730
<b>Who's going home?!</b>

746
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:19,866
<b>Of course,</b>
<b>it's iconic Cher for us,</b>

747
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,100
<b>so it makes us super happy.</b>

748
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:22,902
<b>Snap out of it.</b>

749
00:27:22,903 --> 00:27:24,137
<b>You have brought it,</b>

750
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:26,639
<b><i>and this music video</i></b>
<b><i>was no exception.</i></b>

751
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,741
<b>For avant-garde, I want you</b>
<b>to look like an alien,</b>

752
00:27:28,742 --> 00:27:30,777
<b><i>and that blue look</i></b>
<b><i>with the white boots</i></b>

753
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:32,011
<b><i>gave that to me.</i></b>

754
00:27:32,012 --> 00:27:34,047
<b>And what I love most about you</b>

755
00:27:34,048 --> 00:27:36,416
<b>is you're so sweet.</b>

756
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,084
<b>You're that great</b>
<b>combination of, like,</b>

757
00:27:38,085 --> 00:27:40,353
<b>you're a fierce bitch that could</b>
<b>cut a bitch on the street,</b>

758
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:42,655
<b>but you're also, like,</b>
<b>a sweet little, like, kitten.</b>

759
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:43,756
<b>Meow.</b>

760
00:27:43,757 --> 00:27:45,058
<b>...to see you here,</b>
<b>because I think</b>

761
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:46,693
<b>you bring something</b>
<b>really special and unique.</b>

762
00:27:46,694 --> 00:27:49,662
<b>You listened, you worked,</b>
<b>and it paid off.</b>

763
00:27:49,663 --> 00:27:51,364
<b>We all have those moments</b>
<b>when you decide</b>

764
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,066
<b>to, like, bust through.</b>

765
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:54,734
<b>I can think of times</b>
<b>in my career--</b>

766
00:27:54,735 --> 00:27:56,069
<b>it was hearing "No"--</b>

767
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,305
<b>when I just said,</b>
<b>"Fuck y'all. I'm in,"</b>

768
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:00,840
<b>and there was just a moment here</b>

769
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,343
<b>when you just said, "I am in."</b>

770
00:28:03,344 --> 00:28:07,080
<b>Naomi, to say that you</b>
<b>are the surprise...</b>

771
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:08,314
<b>it's no exaggeration.</b>

772
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:11,351
<b>It's just as surprising</b>
<b>as Chi Chi for me.</b>

773
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:13,987
<b>This is not the final four</b>
<b>that I would have predicted</b>

774
00:28:13,988 --> 00:28:16,222
<b>the first week</b>
<b>in the competition,</b>

775
00:28:16,223 --> 00:28:18,424
<b>and you did it,</b>
<b>and you earned it.</b>

776
00:28:18,425 --> 00:28:21,094
<b>You earned everything!</b>

777
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:22,962
<b>The theme</b>
<b>of the winner's circle</b>

778
00:28:22,963 --> 00:28:24,531
<b>is adaptability,</b>

779
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:26,099
<b>but at the same time</b>
<b>staying true</b>

780
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,901
<b>to your own unique frequency,</b>

781
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,302
<b>and that's the truth</b>

782
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:30,637
<b>not only in this competition</b>

783
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:32,639
<b>but in everything in life.</b>

784
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,041
<b>Taking those cues</b>
<b>from the universe</b>

785
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:37,844
<b>and applying them</b>
<b>but without losing who you are,</b>

786
00:28:37,845 --> 00:28:39,646
<b>and each of you represent that,</b>

787
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:41,614
<b>and I am so proud</b>
<b>of each of you,</b>

788
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:45,118
<b>and that is why you're standing</b>
<b>on this stage today.</b>

789
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:49,255
<b>Moments like this</b>
<b>remind me why I became a parent.</b>

790
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:51,691
<b>Why should you,</b>

791
00:28:51,692 --> 00:28:53,526
<b>and not your competitors,</b>

792
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:56,396
<b>be crowned</b>
<b>America's next drag superstar?</b>

793
00:28:57,398 --> 00:28:59,632
<b>All T, all shade,</b>
<b>after this.</b>

794
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,169
<b>Who's your top three?</b>

795
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,004
<b>Who's mine?</b>
<b>Let's watch.</b>

796
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,339
<b>Final question.</b>

797
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,542
<b>Why should you,</b>
<b>and not your competitors,</b>

798
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:11,411
<b>be crowned</b>
<b>America's next drag superstar?</b>

799
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:13,981
<b>Bob The Drag Queen.</b>

800
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:16,049
<b>I have, statistically,</b>
<b>done the best</b>

801
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,384
<b>in this competition,</b>

802
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:19,253
<b>and you reward the person</b>
<b>who has done the best</b>

803
00:29:19,254 --> 00:29:20,754
<b>with the highest reward.</b>

804
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:22,689
<b>I don't just do what I do</b>
<b>for me.</b>

805
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,625
<b>I literally do it</b>
<b>for anyone who can come</b>

806
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:28,028
<b>within range</b>
<b>of my obnoxious, raspy voice.</b>

807
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:29,663
<b>I serve the people.</b>

808
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:30,797
<b>I serve the community,</b>
<b>and more than just</b>

809
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:31,965
<b>doing stand-up comedy,</b>

810
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,934
<b>and actually getting</b>
<b>my hands and feet</b>

811
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,903
<b>into the dirt of the community</b>

812
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:37,137
<b>and helping it grow,</b>

813
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:39,173
<b>because the community</b>
<b>has helped me grow,</b>

814
00:29:39,174 --> 00:29:41,275
<b>and it's made me</b>
<b>who I am today.</b>

815
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:43,911
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>Okay, now, that was "elloguent."</b>

816
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,846
<b>Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>
<b>I should be</b>

817

<b>America's next drag superstar</b>

818
00:29:47,815 --> 00:29:51,051
<b>because I feel like I possess</b>

819
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,854
<b>the talent,</b>
<b>the willingness to grow,</b>

820
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,590
<b>the willingness</b>
<b>to take your critiques</b>

821
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:57,724
<b>and apply 'em.</b>

822
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,760
<b>I can be funny just as well.</b>

823
00:29:59,761 --> 00:30:01,061
<b>I can make costumes,</b>

824
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:02,930
<b>and I can beat this mug out too.</b>

825
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:05,465
<b>I can work a runway.</b>
<b>I can work a music video,</b>

826
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:07,534
<b>and I've just blossomed,</b>

827
00:30:07,535 --> 00:30:09,169
<b>and I feel like--</b>
<b>that I should be</b>

828
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,571
<b>America's next drag superstar,</b>

829
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:12,339
<b>because I've shown</b>
<b>the most growth</b>

830
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,074
<b>out of--out of all</b>
<b>of these girls.</b>

831
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:17,077
<b>Yes, that's a grower</b>
<b>and a shower.</b>

832
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,346
<b>All right, next,</b>
<b>Kim Chi.</b>

833
00:30:19,347 --> 00:30:20,881
<b>Throughout this</b>
<b>whole competition,</b>

834
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:22,416
<b>I have shown consistent</b>

835
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:24,284
<b>and creative and detailed looks.</b>

836
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:26,086
<b>I have been professional</b>

837
00:30:26,087 --> 00:30:27,955
<b>throughout this whole</b>

838
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,590
<b>I have been willing to adapt</b>
<b>to myself</b>

839
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,091
<b>in any situation I am in.</b>

840
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:33,594
<b>None of the girls will ever come</b>
<b>up with the stuff that I do.</b>

841
00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:35,696
<b>I don't want to be America's</b>

842
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:38,131
<b>I</b><b><i>am</i></b><b>America's</b>

843
00:30:38,132 --> 00:30:40,300
<b>She am.</b>
<b>Bam, thank you, ma'am.</b>

844
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:43,837
<b>All right, Naomi Smalls.</b>

845
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:46,139
<b>I love drag so much.</b>

846
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,342
<b>It is what, like, gets me up</b>
<b>in the morning,</b>

847
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:52,112
<b>and I have such a need</b>
<b>and a want to grow,</b>

848
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:54,515
<b>and I don't like</b>
<b>to pigeonhole myself</b>

849
00:30:54,516 --> 00:30:57,784
<b>into just being either</b>
<b>a stand-up comedian</b>

850
00:30:57,785 --> 00:31:00,053
<b>or a dancing queen</b>
<b>or a look queen.</b>

851
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:03,056
<b>I want to be able to do anything</b>

852
00:31:03,057 --> 00:31:04,625
<b>and show everybody</b>

853
00:31:04,626 --> 00:31:07,060
<b>that I can be successful</b>

854
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:09,196
<b>just being me</b>
<b>and loving who I am,</b>

855
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:11,231
<b>and that is everything</b>
<b>I want in the world.</b>

856
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:13,066
<b>What she said.</b>

857
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:14,067
<b>Thank you.</b>

858
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,369
<b>Well, my queens,</b>

859
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,204
<b>I think we've heard enough.</b>

860
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:19,606
<b>While you untuck backstage,</b>

861
00:31:19,607 --> 00:31:22,109
<b>the judges and I</b>
<b>will deliberate.</b>

862
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,277
<b>Scram!</b>

863
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:25,479
<b>Now, just between us</b>
<b>squirrel friends,</b>

864
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,914
<b>what do you think?</b>

865
00:31:26,915 --> 00:31:28,882
<b>Now, y'all were doing</b>
<b>a lot of praising up there,</b>

866
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,284
<b>and these kids have come</b>
<b>a long way.</b>

867
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,852
<b>I understand that,</b>

868
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,087
<b>but I need y'all to get real</b>
<b>for the realness.</b>

869
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,656
<b>You know what I'm saying?</b>
<b>I can get real.</b>

870
00:31:35,657 --> 00:31:36,957
<b>I'll break it down.</b>
<b>You know?</b>

871
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,326
<b>'Cause, hey, this is still</b>
<b>a competition,</b>

872
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:42,429
<b>and somebody</b>
<b>has to go home tonight.</b>

873
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,865
<b><i>Bob The Drag Queen.</i></b>

874
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:47,534
<b>Spandex leggings--</b>
<b>not so much for best drag.</b>

875
00:31:47,535 --> 00:31:48,936
<b>I would have loved</b>
<b>to have seen a gown.</b>

876
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:50,604
<b>The makeup has always been</b>
<b>not great.</b>

877
00:31:50,605 --> 00:31:51,672
<b>Right.</b>
<b><i>Shade!</i></b>

878
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:53,140
<b>There was some growth</b>
<b>with the looks,</b>

879
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:55,108
<b>but, you know, if I'm buying</b>
<b>a ticket to Bob's show,</b>

880
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:56,243
<b>it's not to see glamour.</b>

881
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:57,711
<b>It's to be entertained.</b>

882
00:31:57,712 --> 00:32:00,247
<b>She's been consistently smart</b>
<b>with her humor.</b>

883
00:32:00,248 --> 00:32:02,282
<b>The Snatch Game was stellar.</b>
<b>Oh.</b>

884
00:32:02,283 --> 00:32:04,184
<b>I also liked</b>
<b>the shady politics ad.</b>

885
00:32:04,185 --> 00:32:05,519
<b><i>I thought that was</i></b>
<b><i>really funny.</i></b>

886
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,055
<b>I think my number one</b>
<b>Bob moment</b>

887
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,489
<b>was "chocolate chip cookie."</b>

888
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,558
<b><i>Shut it down in the acting.</i></b>

889
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:14,828
<b>Really every challenge,</b>
<b>Bob rose to the occasion</b>

890
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:17,764
<b>and was able to inject</b>
<b>Bob The Drag Queen</b>

891
00:32:17,765 --> 00:32:19,700
<b>into that challenge.</b>

892
00:32:19,701 --> 00:32:21,335
<b><i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i></b>

893
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:23,270
<b>Look at how far she's come.</b>

894
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,239
<b>She had to lip-sync</b>
<b>for her life twice,</b>

895
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,442
<b>and she not only saved herself,</b>
<b>she, like, killed it.</b>

896
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:30,210
<b><i>Like, we had</i></b>
<b><i>a "come to Jesus" meeting</i></b>

897
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:32,079
<b>during "I'm Telling You</b>
<b>I'm Not Going."</b>

898
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,982
<b>Aw, she puts the hug</b>
<b>in thug.</b>

899
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,650
<b><i>She was upside down,</i></b>
<b><i>lip-syncing.</i></b>

900
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:37,784
<b><i>Uh-huh.</i></b>
<b><i>Twerking.</i></b>

901
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:39,653
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>I mean, come on.</b>

902
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:42,289
<b>Also, the Book Ball</b>
<b>was a shining,</b>

903
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,691
<b>glorious moment</b>
<b>for Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

904
00:32:44,692 --> 00:32:46,260
<b><i>As great as she looked,</i></b>

905
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:49,429
<b>looking at the four queens</b>
<b>on that stage today,</b>

906
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:51,965
<b>I didn't know</b>
<b>if she's as original</b>

907
00:32:51,966 --> 00:32:53,400
<b>as the other ones, you know?</b>

908
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:55,536
<b>Chi Chi I've seen done before.</b>
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

909
00:32:55,537 --> 00:32:57,437
<b>But I'm in love with Chi Chi.</b>
<b>Right.</b>

910
00:32:57,438 --> 00:32:59,139
<b>Oh, my God, me, too!</b>

911
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,140
<b>...I don't know</b>
<b>what to do with that.</b>

912
00:33:00,141 --> 00:33:01,408
<b>She is one of the kids</b>

913
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:04,645
<b>who come from the sort of</b>
<b>backwoods of drag.</b>

914
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:08,048
<b>She doesn't have to do</b>
<b>the outfits</b>

915
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:11,251
<b>that people in big cities</b>
<b>come to expect,</b>

916
00:33:11,252 --> 00:33:12,719
<b>but in this competition,</b>

917
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,522
<b>judges wanted to see more,</b>
<b>and she delivered more.</b>

918
00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:17,391
<b>Word to your drag mother.</b>

919
00:33:17,392 --> 00:33:18,692
<b>She can definitely</b>
<b>serve a look</b>

920
00:33:18,693 --> 00:33:20,160
<b>better than nobody's business.</b>

921
00:33:20,161 --> 00:33:22,162
<b><i>I loved the Wonderful Wizard</i></b>
<b><i>of Oz challenge.</i></b>

922
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:23,363
<b><i>Yeah.</i></b>
<b><i>And what she did</i></b>

923
00:33:23,364 --> 00:33:24,598
<b><i>with the stripes,</i></b>
<b><i>with the little woman,</i></b>

924
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:26,233
<b>I thought it was really,</b>
<b>really smart.</b>

925
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,768
<b>When she did the Book Ball</b>

926
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:30,871
<b><i>and created the paper wig</i></b>
<b><i>out of pink pieces of paper,</i></b>

927
00:33:30,872 --> 00:33:32,372
<b>it's phenomenal.</b>

928
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:33,707
<b>Best seller!</b>

929
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,976
<b>...with Kim Chi</b>
<b>was the first time I saw her,</b>

930
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:38,779
<b>and I thought, "What in the hell</b>
<b>am I looking at?"</b>

931
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,981
<b>The interesting thing for me</b>
<b>was watching the struggle</b>

932
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:43,083
<b>of not loving</b>
<b>who she is in her skin.</b>

933
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,085
<b>I kind of went through</b>
<b>a very similar thing</b>

934
00:33:45,086 --> 00:33:46,220
<b>when I did "Queer Eye."</b>

935
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:47,621
<b>It was like that thing</b>
<b>that I was hiding.</b>

936
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:49,690
<b>It was like, "Oh, my God,</b>
<b>you're the queer guy?"</b>

937
00:33:49,691 --> 00:33:50,891
<b>Then it was, like, celebrated,</b>

938
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:52,259
<b>and you're like,</b>
<b>"Wait a minute."</b>

939
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,261
<b>I think that's gonna happen</b>
<b>with her owning it</b>

940
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:56,096
<b>and saying,</b>
<b>"Wait, I'm being celebrated</b>

941
00:33:56,097 --> 00:33:58,298
<b>for who I am,</b>
<b>lisp and awkwardness,"</b>

942
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,100
<b>and she will get there,</b>

943
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:02,069
<b>but does she have the ability</b>

944
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:05,038
<b>to command a stage</b>
<b>and work a crowd?</b>

945
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,341
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>She has the capability</b>

946
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:09,710
<b>to change drag a little.</b>
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

947
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:10,944
<b>You know what I mean?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>

948
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:14,047
<b>To really sort of shift it</b>
<b>in a very new,</b>

949
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:16,283
<b>2000-something...</b>
<b>Yes.</b>

950
00:34:16,284 --> 00:34:19,486
<b>Sort of way...</b>
<b>That's an understatement.</b>

951
00:34:19,487 --> 00:34:21,688
<b><i>All right, let's move on</i></b>
<b><i>to Naomi Smalls.</i></b>

952
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:23,357
<b>She has upped her game,</b>

953
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,226
<b>and she has brought it to us</b>
<b>on a different level.</b>

954
00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:28,161
<b>The Wizard of Oz moment</b>

955
00:34:28,162 --> 00:34:30,063

<b><i>Yes.</i></b>
<b><i>My God.</i></b>

957
00:34:31,466 --> 00:34:33,700

958
00:34:33,701 --> 00:34:36,370
<b>I mean, haute couture.</b>
<b>Yeah.</b>

959
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:38,071
<b>High-end fashion.</b>

960
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:40,541
<b>Honey, she was feelin'</b>

<b>I think the turning point</b>

964
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:47,414
<b>was in the black-and-white movie</b>
<b>runway look,</b>

00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:50,117
<b><i>and she did that beautiful</i></b>
<b><i>gray makeup.</i></b>

966
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:52,619
<b>And then out she comes</b>

<b><i>in that paper dress,</i></b>

968

969

970
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:00,827
<b>For me. LOL.</b>

971
00:35:00,828 --> 00:35:03,564
<b>She do have</b>
<b>a way with words.</b>

972
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:05,732
<b>...will be killing it,</b>

<b>not there yet.</b>
<b>I don't believe that at all.</b>

974

<b>Really?</b>
<b>We can all get better.</b>

975
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:12,172

00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:13,674
<b>at this point in time,</b>

977
00:35:13,675 --> 00:35:15,642
<b>I don't think she's there yet.</b>
<b>I do.</b>

978
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:19,146
<b>Her drag is really good</b>
<b>and polished.</b>

979
00:35:19,147 --> 00:35:22,683
<b>And she's fashion.</b>
<b>She's posing,</b>

980
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:24,585
<b>which gives me the chills</b>
<b>every time she does that thing</b>

981

982

983
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:31,325

<b>I know, but I--</b>
<b>I think what she did this season</b>

986
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:38,799
<b>is worthy of being</b>
<b>in the top three</b>

987
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,168
<b>and maybe even taking the crown.</b>

988
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:42,769
<b>Well, I've just got to say</b>

989
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,104

<b>This is your last chance</b>

1002
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,520

1017
00:36:57,524 --> 00:36:59,825
<b>In fact,</b>

1018
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,560

<b>by Eric Kupper.</b>

1019
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,163

1048
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:04,723
