        weren't to hurt?

right now, bitch.               

10
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:23,418
      - You need to create      
     original drag couture

   inspired by the wonderful

   - Robbie and Hedda Turner.

00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:39,996
  - Bustles can be flattering   
  when they're on a big gown.   

20
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:43,065
  This looks like just a bunch  
   of ruched up fabric stuck.

23
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,202

      at Naomi right now.

      This is how you win       
       this competition.

      every single second,

00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,299
             - Oh,

     no more chicken wings.     

41
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:32,404
  - That was an emotional one.  

42
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:35,507
         This has been          
   such a rocky road for me.

               girl, at the end.

48
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,616
       - That monologue.        
        - You were like,        

49
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:49,318
     "Oh, my God, thank you     
    for the Academy Award."     

50
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,119
     - You don't understand     
        how long it was.        

51
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,053
       - This is the most       
    emotional roller coaster    

52
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,054
       I've ever been on.       

53
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,321
      It's such a struggle      

54
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,889
          for me to be          
  around such creative people.  

55
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,090
   And it just crumbled down    
          on me today.

63

      how are you feeling?      

64
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:14,101

    on the runway today too.    

65

 hard work doesn't come across.

      I feel like you guys      
        don't look at me

      when it's not that.       

69
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:27,211
  - Chi Chi will never recover  
    from this bad decision.

    I will never forget that    
 she wasted our time yesterday.

00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,213
     - I would say bottom.      
          - All right.          

129
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:42,215
   Get on down there, Jason.    

130
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:44,550
   - Peter prefers his coffee   
             black.             

131
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:45,684
             - Oh.              

132
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,451
  - I will put him on the top.  

133
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,152
       - Hips don't lie.        

134
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:52,889
 Corey's favorite music artist  
       is Britney Spears.       

135
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:56,459
             - Oh.              
            Bottom.             

136
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,493
  - That bottom is so crowded.  

137
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,794
      All right, Derrick,       

138
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:01,762
 we will show you your results  
          in a moment.          

139
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:03,364
            Kim Chi.            

140
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:04,498
All right, now Jason number two.

141
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,265
            - Hello.            
- Is that an Australian accent? 

142
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,467
            - It is.            
   - Oh. Are you from Perth?    

143
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,168
    You have Perth-onality?     
             - No.              

144
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,203
             - No.              
           [laughter]           

145
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:16,105
                      All right,
       Jason's favorite exercise

146
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,974
                 is chest press.

147
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:19,875
- I'm gonna go with top bunk    
for this one.                   

148
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:22,710
         - Go on over.          
    Look at me, look at me.     

149
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:25,813
- Naomi, Murray's favorite movie
      is "Little Mermaid."      

150
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,381
         - Bottom bunk?         

151
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:29,382
     - I'll drink to that.      

152
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,150
       All right, Miles'        

153
00:05:31,152 --> 00:05:35,621
 spirit animal is Nicole Richie.

154
00:05:35,623 --> 00:05:37,389
- I'm gonna say top bunk.       

155
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,924
- I'm gonna put Miles           
on the top bunk.                

156
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:41,725
         - Bottom bunk.         
            - Okay.             

157
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,159
           [laughter]           

158
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,728
      Make room for Miles.      

159
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,196
Welcome back, ladies.           

160
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:50,232
                Now let's debunk
                 all the rumors.

161
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:53,702
                   Boys, show us
   your bunk preference, please.

162
00:05:53,704 --> 00:05:56,037
                              

163
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,505
           [laughter]           
        - Ex-squeeze me?        

164
00:05:58,507 --> 00:06:01,875
                    Just one top
       in all of West Hollywood?

165
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:03,910
           [laughter]           
          My goodness.          

166
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:07,780
           All right, the winner
 of today's mini challenge is...

167
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:09,348
                  Derrick Barry.

168
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,383
            - I won.            
     [cheers and applause]      

169
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:13,217
    - You've won a prize package

170
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:18,155
          from Casper mattresses
               valued at $2,000.

171
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:19,122
             - Yes.             

172
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:21,491
   - And for our hungry viewers,

173
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:26,429
         we're posting photos of
 our bunk buddies at logotv.com.

174
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:28,730
             - Bye!             

175
00:06:28,732 --> 00:06:31,733
      - Ladies, now, this       
    being an election year,     

176
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:34,770
     I'm throwing your wigs     
         into the ring          

177
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,538
  as the first drag president   

178
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,374
     of these United States     
          of America.           

179
00:06:40,376 --> 00:06:41,775
     [cheers and applause]      
          - All right.          

180
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,476
       - For this week's        
        maxi challenge,         

181
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:45,110
   you'll be working in pairs   

182
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:49,147
       to create your own       
   presidential campaign ads.   

183
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,683
        You need to both        
        promote yourself        

184
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:55,854
    and smear your opponent.    

185
00:06:55,856 --> 00:06:59,223
        #shadypolitics.         

186
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:00,490
           - [laughs]           

187
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:03,192
   - Now, I polled the judges   
         to figure out          

188
00:07:03,194 --> 00:07:06,896
     who's your number one      
      political adversary.      

189
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:08,063
                              

190
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:11,800
         The first race         
         is Thorgy Thor         

191
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:13,568
    versus Chi Chi DeVayne.     

192
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,302
             - Ooh.             
            [laughs]            

193
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,503
          <i> - Oh, shit.</i>          

194
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:20,906
    This bitch just read me     
    for filth on the runway.    

195
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,108
     - The next is Kim Chi      

196
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,343
      versus Naomi Smalls.      

197
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,078
           - [laughs]           

198
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,079
       - And that leaves        
         Derrick Barry          

199
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,216
   versus Bob The Drag Queen.   

200
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,819
            - Fuck.             
  It's fucking Derrick Barry.   

201
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,886
    He's so easily offended.    

202
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:38,087
   So now I have a challenge    

203
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,488
   where I have to make jokes   
         about Derrick.         

204
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,223
     I'm like, "Is he gonna     
     flip out on me again?"     

205
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:44,859
- Gentlemen,                    
start your engines,             

206
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:49,196
            and may             
  the shadiest politician win.  

207
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:51,398
                    - All right,
                    let's do it.

208
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,201
                              

209
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:57,370
            - Shit.             

210
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:59,338
<i> - So I get paired with Chi Chi</i> 

211
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,874
 because I called Chi Chi's ass 
  out last week on the runway,  

212
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:04,275
         <i> but I'm happy</i>         
     <i> to work with Chi Chi</i>      

213
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,475
  <i> 'cause I will outshine her.</i>  

214
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:07,043
            [laughs]            

215
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,811
          My funny thing is that
 I'm actually a terrible tyrant.

216
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:10,879
    <i> I immediately was like,</i>    

217
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,714
       [trilling tongue]        

218
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:15,282
            "Oh! Oh!            

219
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,583
  Ooh, this is gonna be fun."   

220
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,718
     <i> And I wrote 30 pages.</i>     

221
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,089
           "Ads may be no longer
               than 45 seconds."

222
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:24,089
             Shit.              

223
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,623
    I have so much material.    

224
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,824
     I don't want to leave      
         any of it out.         

225
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:28,258
        - Damn, Thorgy.         

226
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,095
         Like, you just         
     got too much going on.     

227
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,396
You've got to edit, edit, edit. 

228
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:37,232
        - This is going         
       to be impossible.        

229
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:38,299
         - Coming up...         

230
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,666
          - Go for it,          
    and give it all you got.    

231
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,568
   - America's drag president   
      is signing up for--       

232
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,303
             - Cut.             
   You can play this one up.    

233
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,337
       - What a fat ass.        
       - More forcefully.       

234
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:48,574
          - [growling]          

235
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:50,075
            - Okay.             

236
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:51,009
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

237
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,546
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

238
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:59,215
   - I want to try to create you
       as, like, a supervillain,

239
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:01,516
                 so I want shots
            of you in the video,

240
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,218
          like, like,           
          doing this.           

241
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,652
    <i> For today's challenge,</i>     

242
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,520
    <i> we have to come up with</i>    
  <i> a presidential campaign ad</i>   

243
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:07,754
    that promotes ourselves     

244
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,023
      but at the same time      
      smears the opponent.      

245
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:15,059
- Well, I'm obviously           
gonna call you ratchet.         

246
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,660
             - I want to play up
                    on this idea

247
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:18,495
          that you're not smart,
      and that I'm really smart.

248
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:20,229
<i> - We have butted heads before,</i> 

249
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:24,365
  so every team is gonna hope   
      that Bob and I fail.      

250
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:25,733
       I'm down for that.

00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,267
  I want ours to be the best.

00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,802
 and that's the kind of energy  
       we need right now.       

254
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,838
 - Why should Bob The Drag Queen
                   be president?

255
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,540
              Because I'm louder
             than everyone else.

256
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,540
             - Shh!             

257
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,208
     - I'm the loudest one.     

258
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,642
        - Shut up, Bob.         

259
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,311
           - [laughs]           

260
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,414
         - Whenever Bob         
     succeeds at anything,      

261
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:48,116
  Thorgy always comes for him.  

262
00:09:48,118 --> 00:09:49,784
         <i> Thorgy really</i>         
      <i> wants to beat Bob.</i>       

263
00:09:49,786 --> 00:09:51,351
 I think that's, like, kind of, 
  like, her personal vendetta   

264
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:52,719
      in this competition.      

265
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:54,053
         <i> They're both</i>          
     <i> from the same place,</i>      

266
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:56,889
       and I think Thorgy       
    just really wants to be,    

267
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,024
   <i> like, the New York queen.</i>   

268
00:10:00,026 --> 00:10:01,358
                        [laughs]

269
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,293
             It's gonna be weird
             having to do, like,

270
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,227
       insult each other        
   when we're, like, friends.   

271
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,929
- We're not gonna be like,      
"You're a bitch."               

272
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,630
"No, you're a bitch.            
You're ugly."                   

273
00:10:08,632 --> 00:10:10,264
"Well, you're ugly too."        

274
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:12,199
       - It's hard 'cause       
      you're not a booger.      

275
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,500
           <i> - Kim Chi</i>           
    <i> and Naomi are not gonna</i>    

276
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:14,834
<i> be smearing each other enough.</i> 

277
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,335
         They are just          
      acting like fucking       

278
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:19,037
    Chia Pets in the corner,    
 and they're just so adorable.  

279
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,105
     - I'm just gonna say,      
      like, she was caught      

280
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:24,608
     wearing flats onstage.     

281
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,143
     Like, stuff like that.     

282
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:30,479
     - I mean, work on it.      
         - I hate you.          

283
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,048
     - Hello, hello, hello.     

284
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,348
          all: Hello.           

285
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,852
     - My fellow femocrats,     
       now, in a moment,        

286
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:39,654
        you'll meet with        
    your campaign advisers,     

287
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:42,723
        Michelle Visage         
      and Carson Kressley.      

288
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,824
            - Whoo!             
         - What, what.          

289
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,725
 - And tomorrow on the runway,  

290
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:49,795
        the category is         
black-and-white movie realness. 

291
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:51,797
           all: Ooh.            

292
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,097
        - So good luck,         

293
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:55,566
     and don't fuck it up.      

294
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:57,468
           [applause]           

295
00:11:00,672 --> 00:11:03,106
             - Hey.             
       - Welcome, ladies.       

296
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:04,307
        - It's our turn         
            to go in            

297
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,974
           and shoot            
   with Michelle and Carson.    

298
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:07,241
    I need to redeem myself.    

299
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:09,610
     For me, this is go big     
          or go home.           

300
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,077
          - Okay, whose campaign
             are we doing first?

301
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,679
      - Doing mine first.       
 - Derrick Barry for president. 

302
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:14,813
                         Action.

303
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,815
    - Bob roams the streets     
        of New York City        

304
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:19,517
            stealing            
    from defenseless people.    

305
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,684
                          - Cut.

306
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:22,286
         - Nancy Grace          
      it out on that one,       

307
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:23,387
        overly serious.         

308
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,322
          - All right.          
         - And action.          

309
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:29,225
   - Bob is only comfortable    
stealing from defenseless people

310
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:32,094
      on the mean streets       
       of New York City.        

311
00:11:32,096 --> 00:11:33,929
- Cut.                          

312
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,664
 - Derrick is doing this parody 

313
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,601
        on, like, creepy        
    Republican white women,     

314
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:41,135
  and it's really funny to me.  

315
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,236
        - That was good?        
       - So much better.        

316
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:43,904
            - Okay.             
     - Let's do the B-roll.     

317
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:44,938
    What's your first setup?    

318
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,372
    - It is Bob in a hoodie,    

319
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,274
  and he'll be stealing money   
       from the Pit Crew.       

320
00:11:48,276 --> 00:11:49,274
   - That's not stereotyping    

321
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:50,541
            at all.             
         - Not at all.          

322
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,342
        - I hope there's        
     no Skittles involved.      

323
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,477
    - No AriZona tea either.    

324
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:59,248
       - And action. Cut.       

325
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,184
   - Bob, creep in like this,   
just to get into the first one. 

326
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:07,589
         - And action.          

327
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:09,324
              Cut.              

328
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:11,392
             Print.             
             Done.              

329
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,794
All right, Bob,                 
your turn, baby.                

330
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:14,662
     - So can I get, like,      
    the big couch over here?    

331
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:17,097
   I'm going for a little bit   
       of Michelle Obama        

332
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:18,765
   meets Hillary Clinton so,    

333
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,433
     like, Blackie Onassis.     

334
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:22,702
         - Here we go.          
            Action.             

335
00:12:22,704 --> 00:12:26,238
     - I believe in strong      
      drag family values.       

336
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,573
Derrick Barry only had one baby,

337
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:29,807
         for breakfast.         

338
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,176
           [laughter]           

339
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:33,577
       - That was great.        

340
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,312
     - So now we have to do     
   the Derrick stuff, right?    

341
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:39,315
  - There's a scene in the end  
    where she eats the baby.    

342
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,050
        Oh, that's good.        

343
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,385
         That's, like,          
       Norman Bates shit.       

344
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,086
         - Okay, good.          
             Ready?             

345
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:49,557
            Action.             

346
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,392
             - Why?             

347
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:55,295
     - Derrick is going in.     

348
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:56,963
   - Go with it, go with it.    

349
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:58,197
           [growling]           

350
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,767
           [laughter]           

351
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:02,901
          Great, cut.           

352
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,101
      - That was awesome.       
          - Good job.           

353
00:13:04,103 --> 00:13:05,770
     - I'm really shocked.      

354
00:13:05,772 --> 00:13:07,203
       Derrick has never        
       let go like this.        

355
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:08,872
          - Fabulous.           
          - We did it.          

356
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,606
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

357
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:12,774
  - Who's going first? Naomi.   

358
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:13,941
             - Yes.             
            - Okay.             

359
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,343
        - So my platform        
     is being a supermodel,     

360
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:18,978
   and I want the whole world   
       to look beautiful.       

361
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,545
         - And action.          

362
00:13:20,547 --> 00:13:22,146
          - America's           
         drag president         

363
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:25,716
       is signing up for        
speeches, debates, interviews-- 

364
00:13:25,718 --> 00:13:26,883
             - Cut.             
        Deliver it more.        

365
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,486
   Punch the words, you know?   
            Action.             

366
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:33,222
- America's first drag president
        must speak as--         

367
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:34,790
             Fuck.              
             Sorry.             

368
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,491
             - Cut.             
    It's all about attitude.    

369
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,426
        This is a shady         
      political campaign.       

370
00:13:38,428 --> 00:13:39,960
I know you know how to be shady.

371
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:41,328
           [laughter]           

372
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,495
    - Have you been watching    
          this season?          

373
00:13:42,497 --> 00:13:44,396
           - [laughs]           

374
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:47,232
        - For my thing,         
 I'm using food as a metaphor,  

375
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:50,100
     and I'm smearing Naomi     
     by how skinny she is,      

376
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:52,635
  and we shouldn't trust her.   

377
00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:54,337
       The biggest worry        
   I have for this challenge    

378
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,472
 is being able to speak clearly 

379
00:13:56,474 --> 00:14:00,642
   and the judges being able    
to understand my sense of humor.

380
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:02,944
                   - Here we go.
                     And action.

381
00:14:02,946 --> 00:14:05,012
        - She acts like         
   she's the skinniest queen,   

382
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:09,049
         but her waist          
     isn't even 19 inches.      

383
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:10,249
       - More forcefully.       

384
00:14:10,251 --> 00:14:11,984
     Remember to enunciate.     

385
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:13,285
          - All right.          
           - Action.            

386
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,453
           - She acts           
like she's the skinniest queen, 

387
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,856
         but her waist          
     isn't even 19 inches.      

388
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,791
- Cut.                          
I think I'm seeing the words    

389
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,925
               as they're coming
              out of your mouth,

390
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,060
                 like, on paper.

391
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,228
Let that all go.                

392
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,796
                  Let's move on.
                      Moving on.

393
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:27,997
      Let's do the B-roll.      
            Action.             

394
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,798
       - What a fat ass.        
             - Cut.             

395
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,666
         The inflection         
   should go down at the end.   

396
00:14:31,668 --> 00:14:34,702
     Not, "What a fat ass?"     
     But, "What a fat ass."     

397
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:35,902
       - What a fat ass.        

398
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:38,038
     both: What a fat ass.      

399
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,439
       - What a fat ass.        

400
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:44,543
            - You went up again.

401
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:46,044
     - I'm nervous for Kim      

402
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,878
    just because she did get    
        a lot of notes,         

403
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,680
         <i> and she's not</i>         
      <i> feeling confident,</i>       

404
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:53,049
         so I'm scared          
 that my friend could go home.  

405
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:56,352
        - Good, move on.        
            - Okay.             

406
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,153
Thorgy Thor and Chi Chi DeVayne.

407
00:14:58,155 --> 00:14:59,154
             - Hi.              
             - Hi.              

408
00:14:59,156 --> 00:15:00,187
             - Hi.              

409
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,322
      - I ain't gonna lie.      

410
00:15:01,324 --> 00:15:02,723
     I'm a little nervous,      

411
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:05,959
   but I just want to present   
     in a professional way.     

412
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:07,427
- All right, Chi Chi,           
you're up.                      

413
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,594
          And action.           

414
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:11,397
         - Thorgy Thor          
    is always caught looking    

415
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,966
         like she works         
    for children's parties.     

416
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:17,469
    Do you really want Bozo     
     running your country?      

417
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:18,736
          I think not.          

418
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:19,836
- Cut.                          

419
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:20,870
       Okay, you sounded        
        like John Wayne,        

420
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:21,871
     which is really weird.     

421
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:22,972
- [laughs]                      

422
00:15:22,974 --> 00:15:24,607
  - I say lose the deep voice.  

423
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:26,675
- It's a little too literal     
and deadpan.                    

424
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:27,910
Like, it needs                  
a little bit of flair.          

425
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:29,111
                          - Yes.

426
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:31,112
       You got that great       
       Louisiana accent.        

427
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:33,480
   - I'm struggling with this   
    because where I'm from,     

428
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:37,751
         being country          
    is not the thing to be.     

429
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,787
        <i> I kind of want</i>         
     <i> to seem presidential.</i>     

430
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,256
             Damn.              

431
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,023
- Thorgy Thor                   
for president.                  

432
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,225
          Go for it, and give it
                    all you got.

433
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:48,426
  - I'm just gonna shorten it.  

434
00:15:48,428 --> 00:15:49,526
            - Okay.             
          - All right.          

435
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,660
         - And action.          

436
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,428
   - My name is Thorgy Thor,    

437
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,264
 and I need your vote to become 
 the first drag queen president 

438
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,866
of the United States of America.

439
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:58,932
- [laughs]                      

440
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,700
           Good job.            
         - Next scene.          

441
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,902
            - Um...

           [quietly]

     That's a better word.      

446
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:10,707
     - Okay, let's hear it.     

447
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:13,510
           - [laughs]           

448
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:14,510
         - Read, lady.          

449
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,212
                        - Sorry.
             I just like to kid.

      <i> - Here we go again.</i>      

451
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:22,884
    Thorgy is changing ideas    
     as she's going along.      

452
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:24,618
        - What is this?         
         What is that?          

453
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,653
     - Ticktock, ticktock.

      <i> all over the place,</i>      

455
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,022
    and it's pissing me off.    

456
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:31,056
     - It looks expensive.      

457
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,190
                - Focus, Thorgy.
                          Focus.

458
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,792
            - Sorry.            
         - And action.          

459
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:38,229
    - Chi Chi's hand always     
 goes straight for the bottle.. 

460
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,697
     - Great, cut. Perfect.     
     - That was excellent.      

461
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:40,797
  - I think we got everything.  

462
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,832

464
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,367
                 All right, this
             is gonna be simple.

465
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:48,170
      It's gonna be easy.       
           - Action.            

466
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:52,641
          What are they gonna do
   with canned food, by the way?

467
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:55,444
       Do you want a shot       
   of Chi Chi drinking booze?

 'Cause you said her arm always 
     reaches for the booze.     

469

  - You're done with Chi Chi?   

470
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,549

        did you grow up         
    in North or South Korea?    

475

  You can't leave North Korea.

00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:13,925
       It's not somewhere       
       where you, like--        

479
00:17:13,927 --> 00:17:15,226
  - It's not a vacation spot.   

480

   black-and-white realness.

00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:20,565
             - Yes.             
       - Lotion up, girl.

           Lotion up.

625
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,636
             - Ooh!             
    - She's gone Hollywood.     

626
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:30,004
       - Sparkle, honey.

 First up, Bob The Drag Queen.  

642
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,134
       Let's take a look        
  at your shady political ad.   

643
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:11,202
           - [claps]            

644
00:23:11,204 --> 00:23:13,938
              Hi.               
    I'm Bob The Drag Queen,     

645
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,207
    a queen for the people.     

646
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:19,710
    And as a public servant,    
I believe in serving the people.

647
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:21,812
     That's why I want BJs      

648
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,214
   for every single American.   

649
00:23:24,216 --> 00:23:28,051
   That's right, better jobs    
      for every American.       

650
00:23:28,053 --> 00:23:29,785
 Buy yourself something pretty. 

651
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:33,621
          I believe in          
   strong drag family values.   

652
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:36,891
     I adopted these three      
       needy drag babies,       

653
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,526
       and Derrick Barry        
      only had one baby...      

654
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:40,760
         for breakfast.         

655
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:41,827
         [eerie music]          

656
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:42,894

657
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,229
           [chomping]           

658
00:23:44,231 --> 00:23:46,864
Bob The Drag Queen has a plan-- 

659
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:48,198
        the gay agenda--        

660
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,466
 and it's designed by lesbians, 

661
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:51,667
     so you know it works.      

662
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:52,868
           [laughter]           

663
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,836
       Bob The Drag Queen       
         for president.         

664
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:56,070
              Why?              

665
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:58,605
        Because I didn't        
      eat a fucking baby.       

666
00:23:58,607 --> 00:24:01,474
      This ad was paid for      
       by my Uncle Steve.       

667
00:24:01,476 --> 00:24:03,042
      He got money, girl.       

668
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,578
           [laughter]           

669
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,981
         - I loved that         
    you threw so much shade     

670
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:11,416
  that you made your opponent   
 look like an absolute maniac.  

671
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:12,851
   You did an excellent job.    
            Strange.            

672
00:24:12,853 --> 00:24:14,786
    - You have a very small     
         amount of time         

673
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,454
      to tell your story,       
       to get the laugh.        

674
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,055
     I think it was tight,      
         and it worked.         

675
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,723
  - You demonstrated gravitas.  

676
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:22,425
 - I'm gonna throw a challenge  
            at you.             

677
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,028
      I would love to see       
        a fully-realized        

678
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,228
        glamasaurus Rex.        

679
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,730
            - Okay.             

680
00:24:28,732 --> 00:24:31,532
     - All right, next up,      
         Derrick Barry.         

681
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:33,300
     - Think Derrick Barry      

682
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:37,003
       because this fairy       
         thinks fairly.         

683
00:24:37,005 --> 00:24:38,471
     As a Las Vegas local,      

684
00:24:38,473 --> 00:24:40,806
     I'm comfortable taking     
   a gamble with your money.    

685
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:46,078
However, Bob is only comfortable
stealing from defenseless people

686
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,213
      on the mean streets       
       of New York City.        

687
00:24:48,215 --> 00:24:50,014
          - [cackles]           

688
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,382
- I'm a very traditional woman. 

689
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:55,385
  However, Bob spends his time  
         dropping acid          

690
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:56,687
     with his friend Betty      

691
00:24:56,689 --> 00:25:00,924
     and engaging in orgies     
    with his friend Thorgy.     

692
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:02,358
    I'm gonna spend my time     

693
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,127
 incorporating drag 101 classes 

694
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,229
   in schools across America.   

695
00:25:07,231 --> 00:25:10,699
      However, Bob visits       
 sick children in the hospital, 

696
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,567
         and instead of         
       making them laugh,       

697
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:13,835
       he laughs at them.       

698
00:25:13,837 --> 00:25:16,670
          - [laughing]          

699
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:17,503
         - Who is Bob,          

700
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:19,172
     and what is he hiding?     

701
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:21,074
          - [cackles]           

702
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:22,408
     - This ad was paid for     
       by Chad Michaels,        

703
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,776
       All Stars Winner,        
 celebrity female impersonator  

704
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:25,610
         of the world.          
           [laughter]           

705
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:27,145
   - That was good, Derrick.    
          - Good job.           

706
00:25:27,147 --> 00:25:28,679
       - You came across        

707
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:31,381
 like you didn't really believe 
     what you were saying,      

708
00:25:31,383 --> 00:25:33,015
        which is perfect        
       for a politician.        

709
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:34,249
     I mean, you nailed it.     

710
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,917
    It was Michele Bachmann     
           realness.            

711
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,518
   - If you really were going   
 for Michele Bachmann, though,  

712
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,687
      you would've looked       
      at the wrong camera.      

713
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:44,058
            - Baby,             
  the shade on your opponent,   

714
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,225
        it was dead-on.         

715
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:47,460
         - You went in          
      on your competition.      

716
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,762
 It was an actual, true smear.  

717
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,964
         - Runway look,         
     a little underwhelmed.     

718
00:25:51,966 --> 00:25:54,566
  Don't just give us that same  
   old kind of pretty makeup.   

719
00:25:54,568 --> 00:25:57,235
     Just show us something     
     completely different.      

720
00:25:57,237 --> 00:25:59,603
    - Up next, Naomi Smalls.    

721
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:00,938
       - Beauty is pain,        

722
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,707
     and I believe America      
      needs to toughen up.      

723
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,575
    A president needs to be     
     able to carry herself.     

724
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,376
  How is Kim Chi gonna do that  

725
00:26:07,378 --> 00:26:09,144
      when she can't even       
         walk in heels?         

726
00:26:09,146 --> 00:26:12,680
          - [laughing]          

727
00:26:12,682 --> 00:26:14,682
- America's first drag president

728
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:17,317
must give speeches, interviews, 
          and debates.          

729
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:20,020
       It's gonna be hard       
     to understand Kim Chi      

730
00:26:20,022 --> 00:26:26,258
   when you're dodging saliva   
   through that strong lisp.    

731
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,527
When I'm elected, there will be 
    no more parking tickets,    

732
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,597
and officers will be trained to 
give free injectable cosmetics. 

733
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:35,633
    Free Restylane for all!     

734
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,835
I'm Naomi Smalls, and I promise 
   to represent you fiercely.   

735
00:26:38,837 --> 00:26:42,672
     - This ad was paid for     
          by citizens           

736
00:26:42,674 --> 00:26:43,939
  against non-lacefront wigs.   

737
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:46,708
           [laughter]           

738
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,343
    - You made some campaign    
            promises            

739
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,911
   that really appeal to me.    

740
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:51,979
           [laughter]           

741
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:54,714
         - I loved that         
   your commercial was really   

742
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:57,316
        all about being         
       a drag president,        

743
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:59,084
     about being fabulous.      

744
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:00,819
 - Tonight on the runway, wow.  

745
00:27:00,821 --> 00:27:02,587
     I mean, you look ultra     
           glamorous.           

746
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:03,987
       - And then the hip       
       with the padding.        

747
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,388
      - Yeah, the padding       
         is phenomenal.         

748
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,857
- I think it's my favorite look 
         on the runway.         

749
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:08,957
          - Thank you.          

750
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:10,858
      - Up next, Kim Chi.       

751
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,026
       Let's take a look.       

752
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:13,828
       - Hi, I'm Kim Chi,       

753
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,963
        and you want me         
 as your first drag president.  

754
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:19,899
       Naomi Smalls says        
        beauty is pain,         

755
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:24,069
      but is she aware of       
the consequences of her actions?

756
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:27,205
      America is a kitchen      
    that needs a strong chef    

757
00:27:27,207 --> 00:27:29,340
 and never trust a skinny cook. 

758
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:32,176
    Small body, small mind.     

759
00:27:32,178 --> 00:27:34,278
        She thinks she's        
      the skinniest queen,      

760
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,813
  but her waist is 22 inches.   

761
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:39,248
        What a fat ass.         

762
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,950
 Shady gays believe in no fats, 

763
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,153
    no fems, and no Asians.     

764
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:47,287
       As someone who is        
       all of the above,        

765
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:49,155
    I understand your pain.     

766
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:51,223
      My name is Kim Chi,       

767
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,358
    and say hello to yellow.    

768
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,092
        This ad was paid        
      out of my own pocket      

769
00:27:55,094 --> 00:27:56,426
     because no one cares.      

770
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:57,927
            Do you?             

771
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:00,296
           [laughter]           

772
00:28:00,298 --> 00:28:01,863
      - When you came on,       
       you didn't break.        

773
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:03,030
 You did the whole mime thing.  

774
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,132
       But the best part        
        was your makeup.        

775
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:06,466
      Absolutely stunning.      

776
00:28:06,468 --> 00:28:07,967
         - But your ad.         

777
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:10,169
  I don't think it really got   
     the job done as far as     

778
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,138
    what the challenge was,     
     which was to be shady.     

779
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
         - We did have          
      to work quite a bit       

780
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:17,275
 with you and your inflections. 

781
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:19,276
     - It was challenging.      
     - It was challenging.      

782
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,580
    It's just--I don't think    
     you're a big speaker.      

783
00:28:23,582 --> 00:28:26,015
    - I do have, like, a bit    
 of a fear of public speaking,  

784
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:29,785
         so to be able          
   to just enunciate clearly    

785
00:28:29,787 --> 00:28:31,953
  is something I've struggled   
     with for a long time,      

786
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:34,556
   and I tried my best and--    

787
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,425
- Are you okay, boo?            

788
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,061
       - Yeah, I'm fine.        

789
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:45,331
    - I wouldn't be so hard     
    on myself if I were you.    

790
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:48,500
   It's just that you've got    
 some really tough competitors, 

791
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:49,834
  and we're down to that place  

792
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,435
    where we have to really     
     give harsh critiques,      

793
00:28:52,437 --> 00:28:54,904
           you know?            

794
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:56,138
          Coming up...          

795
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,841
    - I got totally confused    
     on the smear campaign.     

796
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,375
   You could've drug her ass    

797
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:01,876
        through the mud         
        a whole lot more        

798
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:03,209
        is all I'm gonna        
        really tell you.        

799
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,510
- There were too many ideas.    

800
00:29:04,512 --> 00:29:05,978
             - Mm.              

801
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:06,912
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

802
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:10,915
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

803
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:15,251
    - Next up, Thorgy Thor.     
            - Hello.            

804
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,754
      - Let's take a look       
  at your political shadiness.  

805
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:20,122
            - Shoo.             

806
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:21,557
     Hello, good Americans.     

807
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,325
    My name is Thorgy Thor,     

808
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:26,161
 and I need your vote to become 
 the first drag queen president 

809
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:29,364
of the United States of America.

810
00:29:29,366 --> 00:29:30,932
You need somebody you can trust.

811
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:33,700
     I've never told a lie,     
and I'm not about to begin now. 

812
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,936
     This is my real hair.      

813
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,504
  My opponent Chi Chi DeVayne   

814
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,706
once drank too many wine coolers
          in college,           

815
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:42,641
 and she threw up on the floor. 

816
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:44,609
         Now she visits         
       recovering addicts       

817
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:47,077
and feeds food to the homeless. 

818
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,678
       I'm not buying it.       

819
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,849
     Chi Chi's hand always      
 goes straight for the bottle.  

820
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:55,150
My top priority is health care. 

821
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:57,452
     That's why I'm sending     
    a very expensive bottle     

822
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:00,155
          of champagne          
   to every home in America.    

823
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:02,890
Cheers to your health and mine. 

824
00:30:02,892 --> 00:30:05,559
            [laughs]            

825
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:06,960
             Whoo!              

826
00:30:06,962 --> 00:30:08,995
   Thorgy Thor for president,   

827
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:12,365
   because I'm more powerful    
           than you.            

828
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,365
             - Hmm.             

829
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:14,465
           - [laughs]           
          - All right.          

830
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,732
           [applause]           

831
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:17,167
         - Let's start          
     with your runway look.     

832
00:30:17,169 --> 00:30:19,469
It's not the most glamorous look
         on the runway.         

833
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:21,437
        I think you look        
    like a dead Boy George.     

834
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:24,773
    - I was very entertained    
       by your character.       

835
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,142
        I thought it was        
    a little Joan Crawford,     

836
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:28,409
        Faye Dunaway...         

837
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,577
          - Thank you.          
        - Over-the-top.         

838
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,512
  - But I got totally confused  

839
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,379
         when you were          
     passing out the food,      

840
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,114
    and then you didn't see     
   anything about the booze,    

841
00:30:35,116 --> 00:30:37,082
      and I was kind of--       
  I got a little lost on that.  

842
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:38,817
   - Michelle even asked you,   

843
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:42,020
  "Don't you want to do, like,  
  a boozy cutaway of Chi Chi?"  

844
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:43,422
     And we never saw that.     

845
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,156
  And in an ad of this length,  

846
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:46,957
      you need to show us,      
          not tell us,          

847
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,792
   so that was a fail for me.   

848
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:52,629
  - There was, like, no smear   
    in that smear campaign.     

849
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:55,931
  Also, there was no tagline,   
    like, no paid-for line.     

850
00:30:55,933 --> 00:30:57,465
     - The difficult thing      
        was to cut down         

851
00:30:57,467 --> 00:30:58,733
     exactly what material      

852
00:30:58,735 --> 00:31:00,000
    I wanted to come across     
      with this character.      

853
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:01,469
There were too many ideas.      

854
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:02,836
         - That's been          
       a critique of you        

855
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:05,171
   throughout the competition   
    is learning how to edit.    

856
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:06,573
        - You're right.         
         I could keep--         

857
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,507
   I always just keep going,    
     keep going, and going.     

858
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:12,911
    It is difficult to shut     
   my thought processes down.   

859
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,712
      - Thank you, Thorgy.      

860
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,880
   Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.    

861
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:18,814
            - Okay.             

862
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:19,981
      I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,      

863
00:31:19,983 --> 00:31:22,217
         and I approve          
      this message, girl.       

864
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:23,751
      I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,      

865
00:31:23,753 --> 00:31:25,652
        and I should be         
    your next drag president    

866
00:31:25,654 --> 00:31:28,221
    because I'm real, chill,    

867
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:31,124
   and my makeup don't peel.    

868
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:34,260
  But my opponent Thorgy Thor   
    is always caught looking    

869
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:36,495
         like she works         
    for children's parties.     

870
00:31:36,497 --> 00:31:39,364
   Do you really want a clown   
     running your country?      

871
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,733
          I think not.          

872
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,301
Meanwhile, I'm working to ensure

873
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:47,537
      that every American       
      has a pot to piss in      

874
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,171
 and a window to throw it out.  

875
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,307
     And in that same pot,      

876
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,877
      there'll be chitlins      
        boiling for all.        

877
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,545
      Thorgy want America       
         to walk around         

878
00:31:57,547 --> 00:32:00,714
     with horrible hip pads     
   that resemble Peggy Bundy.   

879
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:03,317
    Who wants to walk around    
          with a FUPA?          

880
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,719
         America says,          
     "Not me, Thorgy Thor."     

881
00:32:06,721 --> 00:32:08,220
- This message has been paid for

882
00:32:08,222 --> 00:32:11,156
  by citizens who like to eat   
 rare and unusual animal parts. 

883
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:14,426
             - Oh!              
           [laughter]           

884
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:15,627
             Well.              

885
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:17,428
         I really love          
     this sassy character.      

886
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,897
 However, your smear campaign,  

887
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,631
   you could've drug her ass    

888
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,132
        through the mud         
        a whole lot more        

889
00:32:23,134 --> 00:32:24,433
        is all I'm gonna        
        really tell you.        

890
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:26,668
      - The look was a bit      
        shocking to me.         

891
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,035
 You're a drag queen president. 

892
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:29,370
I didn't feel like there was any
        "zjooshing" up.         

893
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,205
       - You were, like,        
    rocking the Wanda Sykes     

894
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:33,840
          as assistant          
   in "Monster-in-Law" look.    

895
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:36,075
        I wasn't a fan.         

896
00:32:36,077 --> 00:32:39,445
    I do think there really     
   wasn't any smear in there,   

897
00:32:39,447 --> 00:32:41,948
  and I think for both of you,  
you were too nice to each other.

898
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,582
         Just remember          
     what the challenge is.     

899
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,817
         - You came in          
    in kind of a character,     

900
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:47,719
    and I think we just had     
    to push you a little bit    

901
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:49,787
  for you to be in your skin.   

902
00:32:49,789 --> 00:32:51,155
 - And that's the key for you,  

903
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:54,123
is to just own that bayou charm.

904
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:56,492
           - [sighs]            

905
00:32:56,494 --> 00:32:59,127
       Where I come from,       
         it's damn hard         

906
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:01,195
   to get out of the ghetto,    
      to get out of that,       

907
00:33:01,197 --> 00:33:03,664
 and I think that's why I kind  
 of--I don't want to be ghetto. 

908
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,332
     You know what I mean?      
     Because I feel like--      

909
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,465
  - Let me just tell you this.  

910
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,633
     Let me stop you here.      

911
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,300
          Just be you.          

912
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:11,101
 Honey, that's why we sent you  
        a plane ticket.         

913
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,937
  You know, we don't need you   
      to be somebody else.      

914
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:15,171
       - I do want to say       

915
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,106
   that this my sixth season    
          doing this,           

916
00:33:17,108 --> 00:33:21,176
    and I have not seen such    
 a strong set of girls before.  

917
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:24,546
    There is not one of you     
   that was terrible at all.    

918
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:27,548
          This is what          
  we're up against as judges.   

919
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,816
      - Thank you, ladies.      

920
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:31,251
  While you untuck backstage,   

921
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:34,521
           the judges           
     and I will deliberate.     

922
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:38,257
 Just between us swing voters,  
       what do you think?       

923
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:39,625
      Bob The Drag Queen.       

924
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:40,692
        - Bob nailed it.        

925
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:42,261
  - She's great at the comedy.  

926
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:44,596
 She was great at the writing.  
  She was great at the acting.  

927
00:33:44,598 --> 00:33:47,130
       - Bob had gravitas       
       in that campaign.        

928
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:49,432
       - You are in love        
        with that word.         

929
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:51,167
      - I still don't even      
      know what it means.       

930
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:53,035
 - I know, I want to--tell me.  
       - It means "heft."       

931
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:54,703
 - Like a fat ass kind of heft? 

932
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:57,172
         - Gravit-ass.          

933
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:58,573
        - Derrick Barry.        

934
00:33:58,575 --> 00:34:01,175
- When she was Derrick Bachmann,
    I think she smeared Bob,    

935
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:02,509
   and she smeared him well.    

936
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:04,978
 She had a really good, campy,  

937
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,512
       fun time with him.       

938
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,981
   - Those two have a history   
        of being rivals,        

939
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,281
and they made it work for them. 

940
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:11,682
       This is like what        
        I do every week         

941
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:12,716
     with Michelle Visage.      

942
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,986
           [laughter]           

943
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,521
         Naomi Smalls.          

944
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:21,524
     - She was the only one     
    that threw actual shade.    

945
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:22,891
    - And she's so likeable.    

946
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:27,162
      - Now, that runway,       
   she was padded for Jesus.    

947
00:34:27,164 --> 00:34:28,262
           Gorgeous.            

948
00:34:28,264 --> 00:34:30,697
       - Naomi has risen        
        to the occasion,        

949
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:33,700
    and that's the progress     
  we love in this competition.  

950
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:35,101
            Kim Chi.            

951
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:38,404
        - Her shade part        
      with Naomi was "eh."      

952
00:34:38,406 --> 00:34:40,806
 - I didn't know whether or not 
  she was doing a campaign ad   

953
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:42,607
 or if she was doing a food ad. 

954
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:45,877
         - But this kid         
       is so imaginative,       

955
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:48,212
    and then she brought up     
     the no fats, no fems,      

956
00:34:48,214 --> 00:34:50,447
        no Asians thing,        
   which was very political,    

957
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:53,183
    the fact that gay people    
   are fighting for fairness.   

958
00:34:53,185 --> 00:34:55,451
 But, you know, on Craigslist,  

959
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:59,087
  you're free to be as racist   
 and body shaming as possible.  

960
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:00,322
           - Really?            
            - Yeah.             

961
00:35:00,324 --> 00:35:01,622
     - I'm gonna take that      
        off my profile.         

962
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:02,623
           [laughter]           

963
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:04,258
         - Thorgy Thor.         

964
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,893
     - This runway tonight      
    was a swing and a miss.     

965
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:08,427
       I know she's wacky       
         and different,         

966
00:35:08,429 --> 00:35:09,895
   but it should be cohesive.   

967
00:35:09,897 --> 00:35:11,563
   - The political campaign,    

968
00:35:11,565 --> 00:35:13,564
      love the commitment       
        to the character        

969
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:15,499
        but it was kind         
     of too much about her.     

970
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,900
      - She didn't do any       
 of the smear campaign at all,  

971
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:19,902
 and when she did, it was like, 
     "Oh, enough about you      

972
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:21,236
        but back to me."        

973
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:25,206
        - Lots of ideas,        
but you've got to land a punch. 

974
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,373
        Chi Chi DeVayne.        

975
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,874
    - Tonight on the runway,    

976
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,943
 that is the best she's looked  
    this entire competition.    

977
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:36,448
- Unfortunately, I was not a fan
   of the political campaign.   

978
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,283
      That wasn't somebody      

979
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:40,952
         that could be          
the first drag queen president. 

980
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,453
   - When Chi Chi walked out    
     to meet Carson and I,      

981
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:46,489
I literally though it was James 
       Brown coming out.        

982
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:48,991
           [laughter]           

983
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,326
           - Silence.           

984
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:51,393
             - Mm.              

985
00:35:51,395 --> 00:35:52,860
    - I've made my decision.    

986
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:57,264
      Bring back my girls,      
         Mr. Gorbachev!         

987
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:58,198
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

988
00:36:01,102 --> 00:36:02,234
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

989
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:05,069
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

990
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,905
   I've made some decisions.    

991
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:09,339
       Bob The Drag Queen       

992
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:13,109
       and Derrick Barry,       
        condragulations,        

993
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:15,344
    you are both the winners    
   of this week's challenge.    

994
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:16,645
           [applause]           
       - Congrats, baby.        

995
00:36:16,647 --> 00:36:19,580
       - You've each won        
    an original couture gown    

996
00:36:19,582 --> 00:36:21,548
   from Mountbatten Concepts.   

997
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,549
           - Oh, wow.           

998
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:23,816
      <i> I'm on cloud nine.</i>       

999
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:25,518
       This is the moment       
     I've been waiting for.     

1000
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,685
- Pleasure meeting all of you.  
Thank you.                      

1001
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,952
        - Thank you, all of you.

1002
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:29,253
          <i> - I'm glad</i>           
     <i> that we won together.</i>     

1003
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,587
     Working with Derrick,      
      I've learned to like      

1004
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:31,655
        and respect him.        

1005
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,289
                              

1006
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,793
         - Naomi Smalls         
          and Kim Chi,          

1007
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,029
         you are safe.
