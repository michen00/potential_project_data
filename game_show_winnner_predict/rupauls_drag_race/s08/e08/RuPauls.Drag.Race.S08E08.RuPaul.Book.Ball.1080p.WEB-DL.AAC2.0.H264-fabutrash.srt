       that all happened.       

43
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:28,097

that was a rough one.           

44
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:29,631

  But you're not here anymore,

      so I guess it really      
      doesn't matter, huh?      

54
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:52,181

      for the ages, mama.       

64

        - That was epic.        

65
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:09,895
   - I'm at a loss for words,   

66

67

   been lip-synching tonight,

72
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,804

         Derrick was in the top,

00:02:21,806 --> 00:02:24,273
              I was like, "Okay,
            I did not see that."

74
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:27,209

kicked in.

 so I felt like Bob and I won.  

83
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:45,757
   I think the other queens,    
those bitches better be scared, 

84

    anything Britney to win.    

88
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:53,630

    that they read you for.     

90
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,699

     where all the negative was.

92
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:00,368

       carving yourself.        

93
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,971
    - It's just funny to me,    
    because this is my drag.    

94
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:06,039
    - First let's start with    
   blocking those brows down    

95
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,673
    and changing your paint.    

96
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:11,010
         Derrick paints         
 like a real woman would paint, 

97
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:12,578
      and that's not drag.      

98
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,045
- The thing is, they have seen  
this look from you,             

99
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:15,512
so I think they want to see     

100
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,880
   something else you can do    
   with a higher arch brow--    

101
00:03:16,882 --> 00:03:18,114
    - Yeah, and I get that.     
          I get that,           

102
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:19,582
      that I really didn't      
        change my makeup        

103
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:20,849
 besides doing black and white, 

104
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:22,884
      but I wanted to look      
    like an old movie star.     

105
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,218
     - I'll tell you this.      

106
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,986
If they tell you to do          
more draggy, block that brow.

 That's the most talented thing

00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:32,615
    I think I've seen you do    
      on this competition.      

257
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:35,484
        - Damn, Derrick,        
  you are cutting deep, bitch.  

258
00:08:35,486 --> 00:08:36,585
    <i> This is a puppet show.</i>

  I want to talk to you about   
      is your snatch game.      

261
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,657
 Your New York was<i> really</i> bad.  

262
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,125
- Damn, shady.                  

263
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,026

        No, you didn't!

     Okay, try to do that.      

266
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,764
           [monotone]           
        Oh, Flavor Flav.

      Oh, no, you didn't.       

268
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,768
    - Derrick, does it hurt,    
 me having my hand inside you?  

269
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,570
   No, I'm used to sitting on   
     two dicks at one time.     

270
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,104
           [laughter]

273
00:09:07,743 --> 00:09:09,143
           - Derrick,           
    tell me about your drag.    

274
00:09:09,145 --> 00:09:11,144
      Well, I don't really      
       have a drag style.       

275
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:12,345
   There is no Derrick Barry.

    There is Britney Spears.    

277
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:16,081
        But I hand-sewed        
      this piece of fabric      

278
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:17,815
    that's just buttoned up     
        around my waist.

      look like Chi Chi's.      

289
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,228
             Yeah!

00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,012
      How Derrick did my puppet?

00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,213
 - Is that really how I sound?  

337
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,714
You're like Paris Hilton.       

338
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,950
         It's just like         
      giving me one note.       

339
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:30,251

340
00:11:30,253 --> 00:11:31,351

     that was very clever.      

341
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:32,619
    - You're not mad at it?     
             - No.              

342
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:33,719

       Bitch, I have tough skin.

344

00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,930
      I also have a career      
        with my wigs on.        

351
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,865
   You'll have a career once    
  you start gluing yours down.  

352
00:11:51,867 --> 00:11:53,600
            - Baby.

 she only has one thing to say. 

356
00:11:58,338 --> 00:11:59,837
        And then she has        
      to think for, like,       

357
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,939
hours to come with another read.

   - I have one thing to say.   

360
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,709
      I'm not that smart.       

361
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:08,910

362
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:11,145
 - Were you upset by my puppet? 

363
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,313
  - I honestly don't remember   
         what you said.         

364
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,814
   - Everything was factual.    

365
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,115
           - [laughs]           

366
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,483
       - Why do you guys        
        hate each other?        

367
00:12:17,485 --> 00:12:19,118
 Can't you guys just get along? 
          God damn it.          

368
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,919
    - I do not hate Derrick.    

369
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,688
    I do not like his drag.     

370

   - This is getting intense.   

371
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:27,458
      - You don't hate me;      
     you just hate my drag.     

372
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,392
       - There, exactly.        
            - Yeah.             

373

           - I know.            

400
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:38,214
       My Eleganza Extravanganza

401

is taking elements of your book 

402
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:43,785
        and mixing them         
     with famous paintings.     

403
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:46,721
      Because I feel like       
 celebrity female impersonation 

404
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:49,124
      is such an art form.      
            - Right.            

405
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,891
        But you've come         
      under a lot of fire       

406
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,893
     in terms of aesthetic.     

407
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:57,031
And also last week, the judges  
called you out on your makeup,  

408
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,400
specifically to make            
it look more draggy.            

409
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:01,735
       'Cause you paint.        
  You just paint what's there.  

410
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,971
Do you know how to paint        
an illusion on your face?       

411
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:07,306
             - Yes.             

412
00:14:07,308 --> 00:14:09,241
      I will definitely be      
       giving you a brow.       

413
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:11,043
        - Yes, darling.         
     - Definitely, darling.     

414
00:14:11,045 --> 00:14:13,678
        - If the judges         
 want me to wipe my eyebrow out 

415
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,512
     and draw on a new one,     
       I'm gonna do that.       

416
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,047
   <i> I'm ready to take a risk,</i>   

417
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:19,515
 and I want to show the judges  

418
00:14:19,517 --> 00:14:22,818
          I came here           
  to really challenge myself.   

419
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,586
- Why, Chi Chi DeVayne.         

420
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,520
                - Hey, Ru the Q.

421
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:28,655
- What are you gonna do         
for your Mama Drag look?        

422
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:31,190
                    - My mother,
          to me she's high glam.

423
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:35,094
       She always wears platinum
    blonde hair, long eyelashes.

424
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:37,128
              She loves leopard.
             She's a party girl.

425
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,666
  I definitely get my ability   
     to dance from my mom.      

426
00:14:41,668 --> 00:14:43,901
      I didn't realize it

What are you gonna do           
for your Eleganza Extravaganza? 

431
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,275
 - I'm the unconventional queen.

432
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:56,810
  I've worked with paper before,

433
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,746
               so I'm just going
                to wow you guys.

434
00:14:59,748 --> 00:15:02,015
- Well, Chi Chi,                
remember what was said          

435
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,082
last week.                      

436
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,216
        We want Chi Chi.        

437
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:05,817
          Now, we want          
      an elevated Chi Chi.      

438
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:07,385
   We want you to be refined.   

439
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,219
We say country,                 
that's not a bad word.          

440
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,453
            - Yeah.             
         - It's flavor.         

441
00:15:10,455 --> 00:15:11,553
Savor in it.                    

442
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:13,388
            - Okay.             
         - Bask in it.          

443
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,956
    Never be ashamed of it.     

444
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,157
        - I'm realizing         
      that country is in.

00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,360

    <i> to heighten what I do.</i>     

446

  I just want to pull it off.   

447
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,563
       I want to do good.       

448

   - Well, hello there, Bob.    
         - Hey, RuPaul.         

449
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 - Now, last week, the judges,  
    Michelle, specifically,     

450
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:33,604
     called you out to see      
 if you could do glamazon drag. 

451
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:36,606
        - I'm gonna go glamorous
               for my book look.

452
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:37,808
      So I'm taking this corset.

453
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,476
        I've already got        
    three pieces glued down.    

454
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:40,910
         Look at me go.         
       - Uh-huh. Uh-huh.        

455
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:42,845
         - Do a corset          
   that kind of branches out,   

456
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,846
     goes past the bosoms.      
             - Yes.             

457
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:46,681
             - Then I'm gonna do
          like a gradient color.

458
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:47,882
- Well, 'cause you know,        
Michelle                        

459
00:15:47,884 --> 00:15:48,983

460
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:50,284
                         - Yeah.

461
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:51,918
      - I am in love with       
   the way you look tonight.    

462
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,619
  Less ratchet, more fashion.   

463
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,287
    - Do you call your drag     
         ratchet drag?          

464
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,722
- I've never called it ratchet, 
but that term doesn't offend me.

465
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,223
- Is that a conscious decision? 

466
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:00,557
    - It's a conscious decision.

467
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,758
              'Cause if you come
             to one of my shows,

468
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,092
          it's like me          
       on stage by myself

470

   And if I'm gonna be in, like,
       a gown with huge earrings

471
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:09,096
     and big old sculpted up-do,

00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,931
     by the time my show's done,
my eyebrows become my moustache,

473

         I'm sweating.          
        See what I mean?        

474
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:16,701

         in a leotard.

479

              which sounds cute,

480
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,813
                    but it's not
            that cute, actually.

481
00:16:29,815 --> 00:16:31,114

482
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:35,385

       My mom is my hero,       

506
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,863
       <i> and she showed me</i>       
   <i> that you can do anything.</i>   

507
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,398
       More importantly,        
     come through anything.     

508
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,665
- All right.                    

509
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:38,635
Well, I want to see             
gorgeous Bob The Drag Queen.    

510
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,169
         - Note taken.          
          - All right.          

511
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,203
            Thanks.             

512
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:43,372
             - Here we go, girl.

513
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:44,806
          - Hi, Naomi.          
           - Hi, Ru.            

514
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:48,443
    - Now, this is of course    
 an autobiographical challenge. 

515
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:50,611
             - Yes.             
- We're looking for your story. 

516
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,312
                    Who are you?

517
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,347
      - I'm Naomi Smalls.       

518
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,781
   - Yeah, that's kind of vague.

519
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,315
                    I want more.

520
00:17:57,317 --> 00:18:00,451
  How are you going to insert   
more of you into this challenge?

521
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,687
  - My mom is such a huge part  
          of who I am.          

522
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:04,722
I'm such a huge fan of hers.    

523
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:06,090
  - And she had how many kids?  

524
00:18:06,092 --> 00:18:07,357
         - She had one          
     in her first marriage,     

525
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,292
       and my dad had two       
     in his first marriage,     

526
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:10,826
     and they got together      
       and they had one,        

527
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,594
         and then eight         
      of them are adopted.      

528
00:18:12,596 --> 00:18:13,829
        - And that is...        
          - That's 12.          

529
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,430
             - 12.              
              Wow.              

530
00:18:15,432 --> 00:18:16,764
 - For That's My Mama Realness, 

531
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:20,333
       I want to portray        
what a classic beauty my mom is.

532
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:23,703
  <i> She doesn't need huge hair</i>   
       <i> and big diamonds.</i>       

533
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,370
   She doesn't need anything    
         to amp her up.         

534
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:30,342
  She just knows she's perfect  
          in my eyes.           

535
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,910
         - Now, a few weeks ago,

536
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:34,712
     you were almost fading     
      into the background.      

537
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,281
            - Right.            
 - But you came up from behind  

538
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,183
      and just knocked 'em dead.

539
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:40,650
      - Well, I'm actually      
        kind of thankful        

540
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,017
 that I was in the bottom two,  

541
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:43,952
because it literally lit a fire 
       underneath my ass.       

542
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,321
   This is what I want to do,   
       and I should just        

543
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,955
        fuckin' bring it        
       every single time.       

544
00:18:47,957 --> 00:18:50,390
- Well, you know, two weeks ago,
   it was a design challenge    

545
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,825
         that you won.          
           - Mm-hmm.            

546
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:53,460
          - And I want          
      that same excitement      

547
00:18:53,462 --> 00:18:55,895
  from you in this challenge.   

548
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,996
      - I'm just nervous,       
       because the judges       

549
00:18:57,998 --> 00:18:59,498
  like what I'm doing so far,   

550
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,867
 and I don't want to give them  
    any reason to doubt me.     

551
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,169
    I want to prove to them     
 that I'm not a one-hit wonder. 

552
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:07,104
  - Well, I can't wait to see   
    what you're going to do.    

553
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,572
        - Thank you, Ru.        
      - Get back to work.       

554
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,907
         - Hi, Kim Chi.         
           - Hi, Ru.            

555
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:13,807
    - You're a design queen.    
          - Yes, I am.          

556
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:16,543
          - So this is something
   you can sink your teeth into.

557
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,544
          What are you planning?

558
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:18,845
- With all three of the runways,

559
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,980
       it's kind of like        
      a visual fairy tale.      

560
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:23,315
   So I'm going to start off    
      as a little sprout.       

561
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,583
           - Uh-huh.            
      - And through drag,       

562
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,318
   I blossom into the artist    

563
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,519
   that I'm going to become.    
             - Wow.             

564
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:30,921
         So, now, this challenge
                      has a part

565
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,623
                that pays homage
                 to your mother.

566
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,424
 What is that gonna look like?  
         - Oh, my gosh.         

567
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:37,659
     So this one I'm really     
         excited about.         

568
00:19:37,661 --> 00:19:39,895
I brought a traditional         
Korean hanbok,                  

569
00:19:39,897 --> 00:19:42,230
       <i> because my mother</i>       
     <i> taught me to be proud</i>     

570
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,597
of who I am and my heritage.    

571
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,532
        - It's something        
  your mother has worn before?  

572
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,901
             - Yes.             
  - Has she seen you in drag?   

573
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,036
       - She doesn't know       
        that I do drag.         

574
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:51,971
            - What?             
           - I know.            

575
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:53,639
       My mom thinks I'm        
        a makeup artist.        

576
00:19:53,641 --> 00:19:55,307
     - You know she's gonna     
         see this show.         

577
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:57,742
        Are you afraid?         
      - I am a bit afraid       

578
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:59,777
that she might see              
all of this as,                 

579
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,445
like, a waste of time.          

580
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:03,380
       I just want my mom       
   to be able to be proud of,   

581
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:05,582
like, everything that I do.     

582
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,350
      You know, the person      
        that I am today.        

583
00:20:07,352 --> 00:20:10,819
    - You think she doesn't     
       know that already?       

584
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:12,087
    - I don't think so, no.     

585
00:20:12,089 --> 00:20:13,087
             - Hmm.             

586
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,022
       <i> [plaintive music]</i>       

587
00:20:15,024 --> 00:20:17,524
        - Have you never        
  shown her that side of you?   

588
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:18,892
         - Not really,          
         'cause I just          

589
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:21,360
        don't like being        
    vulnerable with my mom.     

590
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:23,228
            - Right.            
 - 'Cause then she might think  

591
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,263
    that I'm a weak person,     

592
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,666
  and I want to portray myself  
     as anything but that.      

593
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:30,300
      <i> - I think that Kim</i>       
     <i> should tell her mom.</i>      

594
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:31,668
       'Cause I feel like       
      if you're not really      

595
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,702
      opening yourself up       
        to your family,         

596
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:35,904
   <i> then you're robbing them</i>    
       <i> of the experience</i>       

597
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:37,004
       of getting to know       

598
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:39,340
       and experience you       
        for who you are.        

599
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:40,741
 I mean, in theory, I know Kim  

600
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:42,943
  better than her fuckin' mom   
           knows her.           

601
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:44,411
        That's not fair.        

602
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:46,813
     - Is that why you got      
   so emotional on the runway   

603
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:48,781
 when you were being critiqued? 

604
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:51,617
- I felt like I tried my best,  
but it just didn't work out.    

605
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:52,984
So I just got really frustrated.

606
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,953
                   - I just felt
 like there was a sense of shame

607
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,922
            when you broke down.

608
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,822
                 Somehow they're
            all linked together.

609
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:01,325
               I'm not sure how.

610
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,160
             And that's what I'm
               trying to get at.

611
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,562
   <i> - I'm very hard on myself</i>   
     <i> about being perfect.</i>      

612
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,730
     Especially growing up,     

613
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,331
        because I wasn't        
        the model child,        

614
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,365
 and I was the "artistic" one.  

615
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,968
  <i> And last week's performance</i>  
        <i> was a letdown,</i>         

616
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,570
      because I feel like       
        my mom probably         

617
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,972
       wouldn't be proud        
         of what I did.         

618
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:19,974
- I just want to do really well 
      in this competition.      

619
00:21:19,976 --> 00:21:22,242
  - You have done really well.  
         It's top five.         

620
00:21:22,244 --> 00:21:23,643
            You are so talented.

621
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:25,678
 Everybody knows that about you.

622
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,313
             But do you know it?

623
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:30,081
       - I know it, yeah.       
      - But do you own it?      

624
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,782
        - I will own it.        
         -<i> Will</i> own it?         

625
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:33,884
     After this challenge,      
        or later this--         

626

00:26:13,994 --> 00:26:16,060
I don't work with unconventional
       materials at home.       

756
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:17,127
    This is very stressful.     

757
00:26:17,129 --> 00:26:18,528
      It's a lot of shit.       
            - Yeah.             

758
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,961
        - Yeah, there's         
      just so much to do.       

759
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:21,563
     This is, like, crazy.      

760
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:23,765
      - For my book drag,       
  I decided to use cardboard.   

761
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:26,267
     Because I want, like,      
   a really structured dress.   

762
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:28,635
                      I'm taking
           some very bold moves.

763
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:29,836
    I'm not sewing anything.    

764
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,003
          - Thank God.          

765
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,939
- All hot glue and spray paint. 

766
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,741
     - I mean, well, bitch,     
    somebody got to go home.    

767
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:37,908
         - [chuckling]          
           Oh, yeah.            

768
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,476
  - Bob's using more cardboard  

769
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:41,277
       than she is books.       

770
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,912
   <i> That's not the challenge.</i>   

771
00:26:42,914 --> 00:26:44,980
 <i> Honey, you got it all wrong.</i>  

772
00:26:44,982 --> 00:26:49,250
You're in for a rude awakening, 
             girl.              

773
00:26:49,252 --> 00:26:50,417
        <i> - Coming up...</i>         

774
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:51,618
- I think                       
you're gonna take great photos, 

775
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,319
 but that does not take talent. 

776
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,721
 - Bitch, glue down your brows, 
and then I'll glue down my lace.

777
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:56,955
          - Oh, shit.           

778
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,556
- I'm here in this room with you
           right now,           

779
00:26:58,558 --> 00:26:59,757
        in the top five.        

780
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,858
             - Ooh!             

781
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,426
 The library has opened again.  

782
00:27:03,495 --> 00:27:04,427
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

783
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,197
         <i> - [laughing]</i>          

784
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:12,399
 <i> - For today's maxi challenge,</i> 

785
00:27:12,401 --> 00:27:13,933
      we're getting ready       
       for the Book Ball.       

786
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:16,769
       This challenge is        
   literally super-important,   

787
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,337
       because it decides       
    who makes the top four.     

788
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,938
       It's a huge deal.        

789
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,406
    - So, do you guys feel,     
    like, a lot of pressure     

790
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,641
      about being top five      
  and having to perform well?   

791
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,810
    - I think it would suck     
especially to go home right now.

792
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,178
     'Cause it's literally      
   so close you can taste it.   

793
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,414
       - Do you think you       
   hands-down deserve to win?   

794
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:32,681
            - Yeah.             

795
00:27:32,683 --> 00:27:34,616
        I think everyone        
  should have that mentality.   

796
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,451
           - Agreed.            
       - Most definitely.       

797
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:38,252
       - Why do you think       
      you deserve to win?       

798
00:27:38,254 --> 00:27:41,088
   - I've got the best grades   
           in school.           

799
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:43,323
     - But when you look at     
   RuPaul's beauty and grace,   

800
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:44,991
          do you feel           
     like you possess that,     

801
00:27:44,993 --> 00:27:47,626
      because I don't see,      
      in the past winners,      

802
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:48,994
   the beauty that they have.   

803
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:50,428
            - Damn.             

804
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,929
          - That bitch          
     just called you ugly.      

805
00:27:51,931 --> 00:27:53,531
         - No, no, no.          
           [laughter]           

806
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:56,601
   I've just never heard them   
 ever say to a previous winner  

807
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:58,502
  that they did ratchet drag.   

808
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,804
        - All the queens        
think that I can't be glamorous 

809
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:03,440
   because Michelle called me   
ratchet one time, in a good way.

810
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:06,142
And it's all they can cling to, 
      especially Derrick.       

811
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,445
You keep thinking ratchet drag  
means something bad.            

812
00:28:09,447 --> 00:28:12,647
  Ratchet and like, this idea   
   of somebody being raggedy    

813
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,348
    are not the same thing.     

814
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,317
     - But Bob, I've seen,      
   like, your videos online,    

815
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,684
 and I think you're very funny, 

816
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,186
   but, like, the first thing   
      I thought was, like,      

817
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:22,088
    she literally wears lips    
          and lashes.           

818
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,623
            - Whoo.             

819
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:25,390
           - I guess,           
   but I mean, I do my thing.   

820
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:26,858
        You know, people        
     will come to my show.      

821
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,726
     - I just think, like,      
    makeup is very important    

822
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:30,494
   because the moment people    
          look at you,          

823
00:28:30,496 --> 00:28:32,027
that's the first thing you see. 
            - Yeah.             

824
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:33,329
     - I also want to say,      

825
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:34,229
          my makeup's           
     not that fuckin' bad.      

826
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:35,663
             - Ooh.             

827
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,598
  - You guys act like I have,   
     like, the worst makeup     

828
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,266
    in "Drag Race" history.     

829
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:40,867
  Granted, it's not the best.   

830
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:42,636
     I am no makeup artist.     

831
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:43,970
        - I don't think         
    your makeup is terrible,    

832
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,139
       it just looks like       
    you're not wearing any.     

833
00:28:47,141 --> 00:28:48,373
    - It's a bit of a shock,    

834
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,240
        people thinking         
   that my makeup is so bad,    

835
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:52,476
      'cause no one's ever      
     read me for my makeup.     

836
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:54,578
    - I don't think you even    
         try to, like,          

837
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,279
      add more dimensions       
       with your makeup.        

838
00:28:56,281 --> 00:28:57,680
      - I do feel, though,      
        the judges say,         

839
00:28:57,682 --> 00:28:59,448
 "Oh, I can see you're trying." 

840
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,451
      - I think the judges      
 are comparing Bob to himself.  

841
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:05,386
    <i> But if you compare Bob</i>     
       <i> to me and Naomi,</i>        

842
00:29:05,388 --> 00:29:07,588
  Bob's makeup is nonexistent.  

843
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,623
    I'm not, you know, like,    
   putting your talents down.   

844
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:11,458
    But I just think, like,     
   if all people have to see    

845
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,293
    is, like, your pictures,    
     to, like, judge you--      

846
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:16,228
   - Because there is, like,    
     a standard with drag.      

847
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,629
    Especially "Drag Race."     

848
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,430
  You have to have your makeup  
      at a certain level.       

849
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:21,732
   You have to have your wigs   
      at a certain level.       

850
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:22,966
  <i> - They're absolutely right.</i>  

851
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:24,100
      I pay more attention      
       to my performances       

852
00:29:24,102 --> 00:29:25,501
    than I do to my makeup.     

853
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:28,637
      But what matters is,      
  are you delivering a product  

854
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:31,239
 to people who want to buy it.  

855
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,340
      That's what matters.      

856
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:34,475
  So if your thing is beauty,   

857
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:36,677
then yeah, beauty matters a lot.

858
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,812
      But my goal is to be      
        an entertainer.         

859
00:29:38,814 --> 00:29:40,280
    And I am an entertainer.    

860
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:42,549
- I'm not saying that you should
       just be beautiful,       

861
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,985
       and you should win       
 because it's a beauty pageant. 

862
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:48,487
    But you don't have to be    
  a fuckin' stand-up comedian,  

863
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:50,122
     or just a live singer      
          or a dancer.          

864
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,956
       - Why you coming--       
 why you coming for me, bitch?  

865
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,191
     - There is definitely      
       a beauty standard        

866
00:29:54,193 --> 00:29:55,459
     when it comes to drag.     

867
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,128
       You could be doing       
     an amazing death drop,     

868
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,796
     but it's not gonna be      
         as impressive          

869
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,431
     if you look a fuckin'      
          busted mess.          

870
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,033
      - My name's Bennett,      
       and I'm not in it,       

871
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,867
but I will say is I do think... 

872
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:06,901
    - You in it now, bitch.     

873
00:30:06,903 --> 00:30:08,769
  - I think you need a talent   

874
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:10,003
        to not only win         

875
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:12,038
but to make money in the future.

876
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,072
      Like, I'm a dancer.       

877
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:14,573
 Everybody knows that I dance.  

878
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:16,575
   Everybody knows Bob does--   

879
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:17,776
         - Everything.          

880
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:20,678
           [laughter]           
       - Everybody knows.       

881
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,812
            - Whoo!             

882
00:30:21,814 --> 00:30:23,046
         - Not makeup.          

883
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:25,881
       - I think you need       
      some kind of talent.      

884
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:28,717
         I mean, Naomi,         
   I look at you as a model.    

885
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,118
             - Oh!              

886
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,486
          - And to me,          
  that's the only that I've--   

887
00:30:32,488 --> 00:30:33,987
     you know what I mean,      
        that I've seen.         

888
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:35,688
  That's what I get from you.   
       - Right, I agree.        

889
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,356
         I think you're         
    gonna take great photos,    

890
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:39,024
 but that does not take talent. 

891
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:40,525
      - Being a drag queen      
       is such a talent.        

892
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:42,527
      You are a performer.      
You have to be a makeup artist, 

893
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:43,828
 you have to be a hairstylist,  
        you have to be--        

894
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,229
 - So if you're a hairstylist,  

895
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:47,631
   why haven't you glued down   
       your lace fronts?        

896
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:50,700
          - Oh, shit.           
 The library has opened again.  

897
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:52,935
   <i> Insert shady rattlesnake</i>    
          <i> noise here.</i>          

898
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:55,538
  Roo koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-koo-  
        koo-koo-koo-koo.        

899
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,140
 - Bitch, glue down your brows, 
and then I'll glue down my lace.

900
00:30:58,142 --> 00:31:00,075
        - I cannot wait         
      to see a shot of you      

901
00:31:00,077 --> 00:31:03,011
and have screen caps go around, 
   and it's just lifted lace.   

902
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:04,612
         - And you know         
    what yours is gonna be?     

903
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,281
  It's gonna be so much light   
  reflected off that forehead,  

904
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,182
        because there's         
       no brow on there.        

905
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:11,017
           - [laughs]           

906
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:12,717
      I love that you two       
        can't let it go.        

907
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:14,585
   Derrick, you and I are not   
      frenemies any more.       

908
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:17,054
   You two are almost enemies   
      at this point, girl.      

909
00:31:17,056 --> 00:31:19,355
- And I didn't get the challenge
         to do my brows         

910
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:20,923
    until my last challenge.    

911
00:31:20,925 --> 00:31:22,558
        - But the judges        
      told you to do that.      

912
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,993
   The judges haven't told me   
   to glue down my wigs yet.    

913
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,928
      They're telling you       
    to change up your makeup    

914
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,763
    and carve out your face.    

915
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,299
    <i> - Do you not understand</i>    
    <i> what I do for a living?</i>    

916
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:32,633
   I don't carve my face out.   

917
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,334
  There's no lines on my face.  

918
00:31:34,336 --> 00:31:37,770
     <i> That's not gonna look</i>     
    <i> like a female illusion.</i>    

919
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,738
      That's going to look      
       like drag makeup.        

920
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,940
          Not one time          
        did they tell me        

921
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,708
  that my makeup is not good.   

922
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,576
     - And I'm telling you,     
       like, as a friend,       

923
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:46,577
     change up your makeup.     

924
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:47,812
  It's not me digging at you.   

925
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:49,546
- There are some digs in there. 

926
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:51,315
            [laughs]            

927
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:53,716
         - But, Naomi,          
  why would I change my makeup  

928
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:57,053
       when I impersonate       
  Britney Spears for a living?  

929
00:31:57,055 --> 00:31:58,454
  - And that's why it bugs me.  

930
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:00,222
      Because we're coming      
     into this competition,     

931
00:32:00,224 --> 00:32:01,823
     and we're representing     
           ourselves.           

932
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:04,058
     We're not representing     
          a celebrity.          

933
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,393
          <i> I feel like</i>          
      <i> I'm telling Derrick</i>      

934
00:32:05,395 --> 00:32:06,827
        what the judges         
      have been tiptoeing       

935
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:09,095
    around this entire time.    

936
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:11,730
And literally someone just needs
     to be blunt about it,      

937
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:14,066
        <i> because Derrick</i>        
   <i> is not understanding it.</i>    

938
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:16,567
    And even though Derrick     
     never really asked me,     

939
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:19,269
       but someone needs        
     to tell him the truth.     

940
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,437
     Who is Derrick Barry?      

941
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,072
         Chad came here         
    with his own aesthetic.     

942
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:23,539
      He wasn't doing Cher      
        the entire time.        

943
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,175
   - Chad had been doing drag   
        for years, and--        

944
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,410
       - And so have you.       
 - And not impersonating Cher.  

945
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:29,644
            - Okay.             

946
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:30,945
    Like, when you're coming    
        to represent you        

947
00:32:30,947 --> 00:32:33,247
        as a drag queen,        
      not Britney Spears,       

948
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:35,282
     why wouldn't you come      
       as Derrick Barry?        

949
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:39,085
      - Being compared to       
Britney Spears in the slightest 

950
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:40,787
   is the biggest compliment    
         in the world.          

951
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:44,023
    And if I have to change     
     my face to be myself,      

952
00:32:44,025 --> 00:32:47,760
      then I'm not really       
         being myself.          

953
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:51,430
 I just think that you've been  
    upset with me doing well    

954
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:52,897
   in times where you didn't,   

955
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:55,333
     so you take digs at me     
 to make yourself feel better.  

956
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:58,002
   - I disagree with Derrick    
saying that Naomi goes after him

957
00:32:58,004 --> 00:32:59,637
    because she's insecure.     

958
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:01,705
Naomi sees Derrick's skill level

959
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:03,640
     as not being up to par     
      with everybody else,      

960
00:33:03,642 --> 00:33:06,242
and that's why she's frustrated 
that Derrick Barry's still here.

961
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:07,576
    - Am I the first person     
           who's ever           

962
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,611
    said anything like this,    
         ever, to you?          

963
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,513
        - That has said         
     my makeup is not good?     

964
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:12,981
         - I didn't say         
    your makeup's not good.     

965
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,882
      It's just not drag.       

966
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,184
  - These are the most octaves  
I've ever heard Naomi speak in, 

967
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:18,551
        that's for sure.        

968
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:19,685
   You get her excited, girl,   

969
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:21,519
          she becomes           
      Mariah Carey, honey.      

970
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,986
           - [laughs]           

971
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:25,188
    - I just have never said    
  that you don't belong here,   

972
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,856
       so for you to say        
   that I don't belong here--   

973
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:28,190
         - I never said         
     you don't belong here,     

974
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:29,457
 it's just that we literally--  
           - You did.           

975
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:30,457
      You said it bugs you      
         that I'm here.         

976
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:32,159
        - No, the thing         
        that bugs me is         

977
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:34,527
       that you are here        
      finding who you are,      

978
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:35,994
      this entire journey.      

979
00:33:35,996 --> 00:33:38,596
      And we all came here      
with our own fuckin' aesthetic. 

980
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:39,797
            - Whoo!             

981
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,164
           - I'm here           
     in this room with you      

982
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,899
   right now in the top five.   

983
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:44,134
            - Okay.             

984
00:33:44,136 --> 00:33:45,501
        I'm so annoyed.         
            [laughs]            

985
00:33:45,503 --> 00:33:47,469
        [dramatic music]        

986
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:48,603

987
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:49,603
              ¶ ¶

994
00:34:02,213 --> 00:34:06,748
     - We are getting ready

996

     This is the challenge      
   that is going to determine   

997
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:13,720
         who's gonna be         
        in the top four.        

998

        The heat is on.         

999

        about the runway

   that you're worried about?   

1001
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:20,191
       - There's a chance       
   I might not use the bottom   

1002
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:21,592
         of my outfit.          

1003
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:22,959
       You know when you        
     spray paint something      

1004
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,427
     but it's laying down,      
      then you lift it up       

1005
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,995
  and things are showing that   
    weren't showing before?

            - Yeah.             

1007
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:28,097
       - But they want me       
        to be glamorous,        

1008
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,098
   so I want to wear a gown.    

1009
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,465
   - Short can be glamorous.    

1010
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,099
         Glamorous just         
  doesn't mean like a mermaid,  

1011
00:34:32,101 --> 00:34:33,301
     like, long silhouette.     

1012
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:36,269
    - Yeah, but she's like,     
        full-on glamour.        

1013
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:38,638
  So I made this mermaid gown.  

1014
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,506
   But it's hard to walk in,    

1015
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:41,873
<i> and I think I can be glamorous</i> 

1016
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,476
    <i> without wearing a dress</i>    
     <i> the size of Kentucky.</i>     

1017
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:48,446
         This is a risk         
      I'm willing to take.      

1018
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,548
           - Derrick?           
             - Hi.              

1019
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,182
   - My mirror's right here.    

1020
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:54,584
 - I don't feel good about what 
happened with Derrick yesterday.

1021
00:34:54,586 --> 00:34:55,919
  I feel like my mom would've,  

1022
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:57,954
      like, really, like,       
  slapped my hand about that.   

1023
00:34:57,956 --> 00:35:01,256
  And I'm gonna do everything   
   I can to bury the hatchet.   

1024
00:35:01,258 --> 00:35:03,624
    So if he needs a zip-up,    
      if he needs advice,       

1025
00:35:03,626 --> 00:35:05,058
     if he needs anything,      

1026
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,093
  I will definitely be the one  
       to give it to him.       

1027
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:08,694
     - I'm going to powder      
      and then glue again.      

1028
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:09,862
      Is that what you do?      

1029
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:11,263
   - Well, I don't cover my--   

1030
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:12,830
   - Oh, you don't glue down,   
         that's right.          

1031
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:16,099
- But when it comes down to time
     to shape, let me know.     

1032
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:17,100
            - Yeah.             

1033
00:35:17,102 --> 00:35:18,634
   <i> The judges have asked me,</i>   

1034
00:35:18,636 --> 00:35:20,769
     so for the first time      
      in this competition,      

1035
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,804
  I am blocking out my brows.   

1036
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:24,105
              Ooh.              

1037
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:26,873
        <i> I am going for</i>         
  <i> three different brow looks.</i>  

1038
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,541
      I just want to show       
      that I'm comfortable      

1039
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,809
  being a different character   
           out there.           

1040
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:34,579
   I want my brow like here,    
         and then out.          

1041
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:35,613
Does that sound right?          

1042
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:47,557
             - No.              

1043
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:54,363
          <i> - I'm proud</i>

1044
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,897
       to give the judges       
         something new,         

1045
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:58,333
  <i> but he only wants to ask me</i>

   <i> and changing up your face</i>   

1047
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,736
        is so much more         
      than just eyebrows.       

1048
00:36:01,738 --> 00:36:03,170
 But I'm giving Derrick space,  

1049
00:36:03,172 --> 00:36:04,538
        because I don't         
       want him to think        

1050
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,773
    that I'm coming for him     
       about his makeup.        

1051
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:08,007
      - What are you doing      
       for your mom look?       

1052
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:10,409
- She wore this blue dress      
in our family photo,            

1053
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:12,911
   and I did a take on that,    

1054
00:36:12,913 --> 00:36:15,279
      but it's more sheer.      

1055
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:17,181
           - Uh-huh.            
 What's your relationship like? 

1056
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:18,782
                    - My mom was
               great growing up.

1057
00:36:18,784 --> 00:36:20,116
         She was my best friend.

1058
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:22,785
When I came out to her          
when I was 19,                  

1059
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:24,687
that's when everything changed. 

1060
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:27,656
  <i> When I came out to my mom,</i>   

1061
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:30,091
 I thought she would embrace me 
        with open arms.         

1062
00:36:30,093 --> 00:36:33,695
     And I got the complete     
       opposite reaction.       

1063
00:36:33,697 --> 00:36:35,329
  The only thing she said was,  

1064
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:37,431
          "Do you mind          
 if I keep this under my hat?"  

1065
00:36:37,433 --> 00:36:38,598
           - When she said that,
             did you take, like,

1066
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,598
                  super offense?

1067
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,266
     - I, like, shut down.      

1068
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:42,567
   I wish I had not told her.   

1069
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:44,068
   Her opinion changed of me,   

1070
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,771
   and my opinion had changed   
of her at that point, you know? 

1071
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:48,705
                         - Damn.

1072
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,475
   <i> - That's why I have a lot</i>   
    <i> of empathy for Kim Chi.</i>    

1073
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,310
 Because I know that when a kid 

1074
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:57,778
       feels broken down        
       by their parents,        

1075
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,149
it's something that will always 
 be in the back of their mind.  

1076
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:03,817
And I feel like my mom broke me,

1077
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:07,120
       and I just never--       

1078
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:10,390
 I never got put back together. 

1079
00:37:10,392 --> 00:37:12,158
       - How's your relationship
              now with your mom?

1080
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,559
         - It's better.         

1081
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:15,827
               My mom has always
   been a believer in my talent,

1082
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:17,962
and taught me to shoot          
for the stars.                  

1083
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:20,765
 And the worst that can happen  
    is you land on the moon.    

1084
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,200
          - I love it.          
   You got a great mom, kid.

          straight on.          

1088

Relax.

      "Ooh, my goodness."

       different person.        

1098

  and still loving each other   
        and not judging.        

1387
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:38,502
   - I think that she's such    
    a beautiful woman to me.    

1388
00:48:38,504 --> 00:48:41,739
     I--I love her so much.     

1389
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:45,042
     Um, I just hope she's      
proud of me, 'cause I love her. 

1390
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:47,377
    - Do you have a message     
you want to say to your mother? 

1391
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:49,445
   - Thank you for everything   
       you've ever done.        

1392
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:53,916
   And I hope I can repay you   
    for the rest of my life.    

1393
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:55,317
                      I'm sorry.

1394
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,851
             [sobs]             

1395
00:48:56,853 --> 00:49:00,187
      - Thank you so much.      
          - Thank you.          

1396
00:49:00,189 --> 00:49:03,222
  Up next, Bob The Drag Queen.  

1397
00:49:03,224 --> 00:49:04,823
          - I thought           
     in the baby challenge,     

1398
00:49:04,825 --> 00:49:06,257
      you actually looked       

1399
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:09,026
    like you weren't trying     
   to be too pretty about it.   

1400
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:10,760
  You just seemed real to me.   

1401
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:14,396
     And I thought you did      
a great job reading your script.

1402
00:49:14,398 --> 00:49:17,566
 It sounded really enthusiastic 
    and flowed really well.     

1403
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:20,735
     - Tonight I challenged     
      you to be glamorous.      

1404
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:22,136
           - Mm-hmm.            

1405
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:26,006
         - I think that         
 you're most of the way there.  

1406
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,207
      I think your makeup       
         looks pretty,          

1407
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:28,608
    and I think your body's     
        always on point.        

1408
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,409
          But I am not          
      getting book at all.      

1409
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:32,177
     I'm getting cardboard.     

1410
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:33,445
            - Well,             
there is some cardboard in here,

1411
00:49:33,447 --> 00:49:35,012
        but I don't have        
    any pages from my book.     

1412
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,413
           - Why not?           

1413
00:49:36,415 --> 00:49:38,414
   - Well, I had this mermaid   
     bottom that had pages,     

1414
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:39,615
   but once I finally saw it,   

1415
00:49:39,617 --> 00:49:41,149
          I was like,           
    mmm, it's a little much.    

1416
00:49:41,151 --> 00:49:43,852
  - But you took off the part   
that actually is the challenge. 

1417
00:49:43,854 --> 00:49:45,753
- Well, I'm still wearing books,
  I'm just not wearing pages.   

1418
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:47,754
          It's a book.          

1419
00:49:47,756 --> 00:49:48,822
            - Okay.             

1420
00:49:48,824 --> 00:49:50,223
    - Don't listen to them.     

1421
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:51,590
   Yeah, maybe it's not made    
       out of the pages,        

1422
00:49:51,592 --> 00:49:53,259
     but I like the color,      

1423
00:49:53,261 --> 00:49:55,260
and I like that it is different,
 and it's kind of shingle-like. 

1424
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:56,461
    You have beautiful legs,    

1425
00:49:56,463 --> 00:49:58,162
    and I love what you did     
        with your hair.         

1426
00:49:58,164 --> 00:49:59,862
  - I was going to wear a wig,  
      but I was like, uh.       

1427
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:00,863
            - Right.            
           [laughter]           

1428
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:01,963
            - Yeah.             

1429
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,798
       - Thank you, Bob.        
          - Thank you.          

1430
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,400
     - All right, up next.      

1431
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,035
         Derrick Barry.         

1432
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,904
 - I have seen what you've done 
      with your eyebrows.       

1433
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:11,506
   I acknowledge that you're    
  trying something different.   

1434
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,775
      But it's going to be      
       a journey for you.       

1435
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:15,977
     This, tonight, for me,     

1436
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,445
         I just thought         
     it was way too plain,      

1437
00:50:18,447 --> 00:50:20,880
       and way too basic.       

1438
00:50:20,882 --> 00:50:24,049
   - But I like that it looks   
  like you have a real vagina.  

1439
00:50:24,051 --> 00:50:25,183
          - She does.           
            - Yeah.             

1440
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:26,651
            - Yeah.             
  - My mom would be so proud.   

1441
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,753
          - Oh, yeah?           

1442
00:50:28,755 --> 00:50:31,188
  - Derrick, I see you trying   
    harder than anyone else,    

1443
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,389
      and that I applaud.       

1444
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:34,090
          But I think           
      you're getting lost       

1445
00:50:34,092 --> 00:50:35,491
        in what we want.        
            - Okay.             

1446
00:50:35,493 --> 00:50:38,961
    - We want you to do you     
         at this level.         

1447
00:50:38,963 --> 00:50:43,198
        And I don't know        
   that you're at this level.   

1448
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,866
 - All right, Chi Chi DeVayne.  

1449
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:48,502
 - Your dress tonight is really 
      one of my favorites.      

1450
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:51,371
      - Thank you, Jesus.       

1451
00:50:51,373 --> 00:50:53,105
   - Each one of these looks    
          told a story          

1452
00:50:53,107 --> 00:50:55,040
        that made me get        
to know you a little bit better,

1453
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,274
   especially with your mom.    

1454
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:57,542
     Your mom is giving me      

1455
00:50:57,544 --> 00:50:59,176
      "Real Housewife" of       
    I hope my neighborhood.     

1456
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:00,911
           [laughter]           

1457
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:02,245
- Real Housewives of Shreveport.

1458
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:04,381
            - Yeah.             

1459
00:51:04,383 --> 00:51:05,615
  - Everything that you read,   

1460
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:08,251
           your voice           
  just really super sized it.   

1461
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:09,518
      And I think you have      
        my favorite line        

1462
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,785
        of the evening,         
            was that            

1463
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:12,887
    "I'm just a country girl    
         with dreams."          

1464
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:14,055
           [laughter]           

1465
00:51:14,057 --> 00:51:15,490
 You just seemed really natural 

1466
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:16,791
          and honest,           

1467
00:51:16,793 --> 00:51:17,992
      and I think you did       
     a great job with that.     

1468
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:19,026
       - Ooh, thank you.        

1469
00:51:19,028 --> 00:51:20,393
    - I completely disagree.    

1470
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:22,829
           [laughter]           

1471
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:25,198
     - Thank you, Chi Chi,      
     and thank you, ladies.     

1472
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,467
 Now, while you go and curl up  

1473
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:29,635
  with a good book backstage,   

1474
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:33,039
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

1475
00:51:33,041 --> 00:51:34,206
        All right, now,         

1476
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,809
        just between us         
     best-selling authors,      

1477
00:51:36,811 --> 00:51:38,076
       what do you think?       

1478
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:39,777
            Kim Chi.            

1479
00:51:39,779 --> 00:51:42,179
     - Kim Chi is a walking     
          art exhibit.          

1480
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:44,715
     And tonight there was      
        so much emotion         

1481
00:51:44,717 --> 00:51:46,583
  with the stories of her mom.  

1482
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:49,953
   - Who doesn't, by the way,   
    know that she does drag.    

1483
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:52,855
 - There was absolutely no joy  
    when she was her mother.    

1484
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:55,157
    She conveys a lot to me     
    by not saying anything.     

1485
00:51:55,159 --> 00:51:57,559
     - Yeah, there's a lot      
to read between the lines there.

1486
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:59,460
  When she did her voice-over,  

1487
00:51:59,462 --> 00:52:01,361
         the conviction         
      wasn't quite there.       

1488
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:02,729
There's still a tentative thing.

1489
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:06,399
  And I think once her mother   
       gets to meet her,        

1490
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:08,134
       and they get over        
        that part of it,        

1491
00:52:08,136 --> 00:52:10,569
  Kim Chi will fully blossom.   

1492
00:52:10,571 --> 00:52:12,337
         Naomi Smalls.          

1493
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:15,473
     - Miss Underdog 2016.      
             - Yes.             

1494
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:16,874
 - I mean, who saw this coming? 

1495
00:52:16,876 --> 00:52:19,209
 I am filled with joy for her.  

1496
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:20,877
  She's just come full circle,  

1497
00:52:20,879 --> 00:52:23,146
      and at 21 years old,      
    listening to direction.     

1498
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:24,580
             - Yes.             
     - And pushing herself.     

1499
00:52:24,582 --> 00:52:26,581
 - Naomi is checking every box  
            for me.             

1500
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:29,217
    She is checking fashion     
    She is checking glamour.    

1501
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:30,651
  She is checking performance.  

1502
00:52:30,653 --> 00:52:32,452
 She is checking heartstrings.  

1503
00:52:32,454 --> 00:52:34,687
       Now I find myself        
        rooting for her.        

1504
00:52:34,689 --> 00:52:35,821
      But is it too late?       

1505
00:52:35,823 --> 00:52:37,188
 - I don't think it's too late. 

1506
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,323
    At least she got there.     
   - Better late than never.    

1507
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:41,124
     - It's like a period.      
         - What's that?         

1508
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:45,127
       - Something I had        
        a long time ago.        

1509
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,996
     - Bob The Drag Queen.      

1510
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,698
       - Bob, I thought,        
      nailed Jerri Blank.       

1511
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,068
       Out of everybody,        
she had the character the best. 

1512
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,070
 What I don't like is the fact  

1513
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,871
that she wore a cardboard dress,

1514
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,972
     and books are not made     
    of corrugated cardboard.    

1515
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:00,606
      - Don't judge a book      
         by its cover.

  the dress or the cardboard.   

1518
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:06,411
       At least he added        
       some color to it.        

1519
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:08,913
     And he made me laugh,      
      just looking at him.      

1520
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:10,680

        that he's funny.        

1521
00:53:10,682 --> 00:53:12,949
         The humor kind         
   of just rolls off of him.    

1522
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:14,784
        - Derrick Barry.        

1523
00:53:14,786 --> 00:53:17,686

     on going all the way.

          for Derrick.          

1532
00:53:30,096 --> 00:53:31,962
         She had, like,         
      two lines for blush,      

1533
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:34,064

        and buffed out.

on a sexy night in a nightgown, 

1537

     that convoluted story

I can't even put my head around.

1539

      fuckin' reach, okay?      

1540
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:48,475
  The thing, you're on stage,   
she glued your book to a corset 

1541
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:50,376
       and put panties on       
       and she was done.        

1542
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:53,646
    This was a miss tonight.    
           I'm sorry.           

1543
00:53:53,648 --> 00:53:57,015
   - Yes, Derrick's wasn't up   
  to par with the other girls,  

1544
00:53:57,017 --> 00:53:59,150
      but is anyone trying      
      harder than Derrick?      

1545
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,785
         And that's got         
    to count for something.     

1546
00:54:00,787 --> 00:54:04,154
       - She's so willing       
    to receive the critique.    

1547
00:54:04,156 --> 00:54:06,055
  - But this is not the place   
    to find out who you are.    

1548
00:54:06,057 --> 00:54:07,856
      She's at her limit.

    is getting our critiques    

1551

       And it's working.        

1554
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,432
    This is when the horses     
      are rounding that--       

1555
00:54:20,434 --> 00:54:22,400
 I've never seen a horse race,  
but when they go in there right 

1556
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:24,502
 before they finish, and, like, 
      one of them sort of,      

1557
00:54:24,504 --> 00:54:25,669
 like, they start to separate?  

1558
00:54:25,671 --> 00:54:27,337
          - Yes, yes.           
     - This is that moment.     

1559

1562
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:32,940
    - I thought her writing     
        was really good,        

1563
00:54:32,942 --> 00:54:35,809
       and I could listen       
     to hear talk forever.      

1564

She's just got such star power. 

1565
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:40,680
     There's a genuineness      

1566
00:54:40,682 --> 00:54:42,948
     that flows off of her.     
             - Yes.             

1567
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,385
    - For me, I'm gonna say     
     probably my favorite.      

1568
00:54:46,387 --> 00:54:47,552
             - Wow.             

1569
00:54:47,554 --> 00:54:49,187
    - Because neck and neck     
         with Kim Chi,          

1570
00:54:49,189 --> 00:54:51,322
     and what broke it was      
   the performance of Jerri,    

1571
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:52,489
  took it over the top for me.  

1572
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:54,390
   - But Kim Chi's mama drag,   

1573
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:58,127
      it was so completely      
    compelling, so mournful     

1574
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:00,695
  and so closeted, culturally.  

1575
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:02,831
        And that, to me,        
        is real acting.

00:57:59,109 --> 00:58:02,710
   ¶ And it's nice and dark,    
    and the music's in me ¶     

1641
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,645
   ¶ And I'm still real hot ¶   

1642
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:11,552
          ¶ And I know          
 you love me like you should ¶  

1643
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,120
     ¶ Oh, you make me feel     
         mighty real ¶          

1644
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,895
  ¶ Make me feel mighty real ¶  

1645
00:58:22,897 --> 00:58:24,896
        ¶ I feel real ¶         

1646
00:58:24,898 --> 00:58:26,764
         ¶ Real real ¶          

1647
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:28,532
        ¶ I feel real ¶         
            - Whoo!             

1648
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:31,068
    - ¶ I feel real, real ¶     

1649
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:38,374
¶ You make me feel mighty real ¶

1650
00:58:38,376 --> 00:58:42,311
             ¶ Oh,              
    you've got to be real ¶     

1651
00:58:42,313 --> 00:58:45,313
        ¶ Mighty real ¶         

1652
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:49,183
         ¶ I feel real          
      when you touch me ¶       

1653
00:58:49,185 --> 00:58:52,553
¶ I feel real when you hold me ¶

1654
00:58:52,555 --> 00:58:54,588
            ¶ Ooh! ¶            

1655
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,289
           ¶ Whoo! ¶            

1656
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:59,058
           [laughter]           

1657
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,694
     [cheers and applause]      

1658
00:59:01,696 --> 00:59:03,228
           - Ladies.            

1659
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:04,663
     I've made my decision.     

1660
00:59:11,104 --> 00:59:13,905
      Bob The Drag Queen,       
       shantay, you stay.       

1661
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:17,108
          - Thank you.          

1662
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,310
      I just want to say,       
I probably had the biggest butt 

1663
00:59:20,312 --> 00:59:22,145
         of this season         
      with Derrick Barry,       

1664
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:24,180
         and I ended up         
 being her biggest cheerleader  

1665
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:25,681
      in this competition.      

1666
00:59:25,683 --> 00:59:27,416
     Even if you're afraid      
         of something,          

1667
00:59:27,418 --> 00:59:29,684
she does it harder than anyone. 

1668
00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:31,820
     Honestly, I love her.      

1669
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:33,988
      And I guess that was      
  the lesson we learned today.  

1670
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,125
           [laughter]           

1671
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:41,528
- You may join the other girls. 

1672
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,163
          - [whispers]          
        You're so brave.        

1673
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:49,435
 - Derrick Barry, you came here 
     as a Vegas headliner,      

1674
00:59:49,437 --> 00:59:53,872
         but you leave          
     an international star.     

1675
00:59:53,874 --> 00:59:58,643
    Stronger than yesterday.    

1676
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,577
      - Thank you so much       
     for this opportunity.      

1677
01:00:00,579 --> 01:00:02,012
        I'm very proud,         

1678
01:00:02,014 --> 01:00:03,847
        and I'm humbled         
       by the experience        

1679
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:05,248
     that you've given me.      

1680
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,149
    And I don't want to cry,    
    but I'm going to because    

1681
01:00:07,151 --> 01:00:10,085
     that's just who I am.      

1682
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:11,286
   And I thought for so long    

1683
01:00:11,288 --> 01:00:13,588
      I would just be lost      
         in Las Vegas,          

1684
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,489
      and now I get to go       
      all around the world      

1685
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:18,058
       and represent one        
     of my favorite icons.      

1686
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,326
     So thank you so much.      

1687
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:21,995
          - Thank you.          
      Thank you, Derrick.       

1688
01:00:21,997 --> 01:00:25,264
       Now, sashay away.        

1689
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:27,432
           [applause]           

1690
01:00:27,434 --> 01:00:29,367
           - Derrick!           

1691
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:30,568
         - Go, Derrick!         

1692
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:32,569
    - That's how you go out     
        in style, girls.        

1693
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:33,903
           [laughter]           

1694
01:00:33,905 --> 01:00:37,773
 As the international showgirl  
         of the world!          

1695
01:00:37,775 --> 01:00:40,475
             - Yes!             
    [laughter and applause]     

1696
01:00:40,477 --> 01:00:42,042
  <i> - I got to shine as myself.</i>  

1697
01:00:42,044 --> 01:00:43,377
   <i> And that's the one thing</i>    

1698
01:00:43,379 --> 01:00:45,478
       <i> I've always felt</i>        
      <i> that I was lacking.</i>      

1699
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,948
     <i> I didn't really have</i>      
  <i> a character or a knowledge</i>   

1700
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,649
      <i> of who I want to be</i>      
         <i> or who I am.</i>          

1701
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:53,151
        But I showed up         
      in this competition,      

1702
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:55,987
 and I did everything I could.  

1703
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,688
 <i> And that's all that matters.</i>  

1704
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,590
 <i> You have to show up in life.</i>  

1705
01:00:59,592 --> 01:01:02,192
     <i> And I showed up here,</i>     
     <i> and I made it so far.</i>     

1706
01:01:02,194 --> 01:01:04,460
   <i> And I cannot wait to see</i>    

1707
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:07,963
   <i> where this takes me now.</i>    

1708
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,531
       So thank you, Ru.        

1709
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,138
      - My fantastic four,      
        condragulations.        

1710
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,373
      Remember, you can't       
         love yourself,         

1711
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,541
 how in the hell you gonna love 
         somebody else?         

1712
01:01:21,543 --> 01:01:23,242
   Can I get an amen in here?   

1713
01:01:23,244 --> 01:01:24,577
           all: Amen!           

1714
01:01:24,579 --> 01:01:26,578
          - All right,          
    now let the music play.
