           [laughter]           

125
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,951
      Bob The Drag Queen.       

126
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:21,420
You may be from New York, honey,

127
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,822
         but those feet         
  are still from Mississippi.   

128
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,556
           [laughter]           
           - Love it.           

129
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,192
  - Chi Chi, your drag is just  
       like turkey neck.        

130
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,026
  Cheap, and no one wants it.   

131
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:31,894
           [laughter]           
             - Wow.             

132
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,462
        - Naomi Smalls.         

133
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:36,197
  Your wardrobe reminds me of   
 a legendary "Drag Race" queen. 

134
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,564
      Nicole Paige Brooks.      

135
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:39,966
           [laughter]           
            - Nice.             

136
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,801
            - Shade!            

137
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,470
       Who knew that was lurking
               underneath that--

138
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:47,005
         - We all knew.         
         - We all knew.         

139
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,973
           - Simple.            
        I mean Derrick.         

140
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:50,107
        I mean Britney.         

141
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:51,341
    You know, you are pretty    
          attractive.           

142
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,542
I'd hit that baby one more time.

143
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,010
           [laughter]           

144
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:55,945
              Bob.              

145
00:05:55,947 --> 00:05:58,747
        Please shut up.         
           [laughter]           

146
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:00,415
            - Naomi.            
      No one knows whether      

147
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,683
      to call you "Ny-omi"      
         or "Nay-omi,"          

148
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:04,719
                but judging from
              your runway looks,

149
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:06,119
       no one's gonna be        
      calling you at all.       

150
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:07,854
           [laughter]           

151
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:10,223
      Bob The Drag Queen.       
         I had no idea          

152
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,324
that there are different shades 
            of ashy.            

153
00:06:12,326 --> 00:06:14,359
           [laughter]           

154
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,626
           - Kim Chi.           

155
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:18,428
        You are stomping        
  for the gods on the runway.   

156
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,896
           [laughter]           

157
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:22,231
     I just wish your drag      
      would get raptured.       

158
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:23,632
           [laughter]           

159
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,501
 Naomi. I'm gonna give you some 
        advice, darling.        

160
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:28,269
                  No one's gonna
              take you seriously

161
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:31,038
        if you were born        
   after Windows 95 came out.   

162
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,372
           [laughter]           

163
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:35,074
    - Robbie Turner, we know    
    you're a vintage queen,     

164
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:36,942
    but do you have to smell    
      like mothballs too?       

165
00:06:36,944 --> 00:06:38,810
        - Oh, fuck off.         
           [laughter]           

166
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,077
        - Derrick Barry.        

167
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,479
  You say it takes you an hour  
        to do your face.        

168
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:44,547
        Why does it look        
       like five minutes?       

169
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,815
           [laughter]           

170
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,350
           - Beauty.            

171
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:51,953
   - It is a known fact that    
Derrick Barry is not very smart.

172
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:54,288
When she heard "Britney Spears,"
      she said, "Does she?      

173
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,491
       I prefer fencing."       
           [laughter]           

174
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,859
    It is very hard to have     
  an intelligent conversation   

175
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,393
      with Derrick Barry.       

176
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:04,095
     The only thing harder      
 is Robbie Turner's wig lines.  

177
00:07:04,097 --> 00:07:05,897
           [laughter]           

178
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:09,099
       Rob-bie Turn-ter!        

179
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:13,436
  I know you're a huge fan of   
 classic movies and television. 

180
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:17,173
   May I recommend one of my    
   favorite classic TV shows?   

181
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,407
           "Flipper."           

182
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,945
           [laughter]           

183
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:26,715
       - Oh, my goodness!       
      Y'all went in deep!       

184
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:29,317
- I feel like I'm a lot         
shadier just by being here.     

185
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,752
           [laughter]           

186
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:34,255
     The winner of today's      
       mini-challenge...        

187
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:35,623
     is Bob The Drag Queen.     

188
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,692
            - Whoo!             
           [applause]           

189
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,326
    <i> - Bob just won, again.</i>     

190
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,061
              Ugh.              

191
00:07:41,063 --> 00:07:45,398
   - You've won jewels valued   
           at $1,500            

192
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
   <i> from Fierce Drag Jewels.</i>    

193
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:48,834
           - Oh, wow!           

194

    - And to see more reads,

00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,572
  Let's say good-bye to Mark,   
           everybody!           

196
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,341
        all: Bye, Mark!         

197
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,844
    - Ladies, since you love    
        reading so much,        

198
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,881
    I want to share with you    
 my favorite book of all time,

00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,449
 "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz."

00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,950
           [applause]           

201
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:10,753
   This week's maxi-challenge   
         is your chance         

202
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:14,155
    to strut your stuff down    
     the yellow brick road.     

203
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:17,591
But you won't be doing it alone.

204
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:21,961
      Please welcome some       
    "Drag Race" super fans.

00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:30,368
   The cast of Lifetime TV's    
      "Little Women: LA."       

207
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,307
        Say hello to...         

208
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:39,710
   And last but not least...

      makeover challenge,       

210
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,883
       you need to create       
     original drag couture      

211
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:48,752
    for you and your partner    
          inspired by           

212
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:52,822
    one of the characters in

215
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,360
      Little women of LA,       

216
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:02,163
      you choose the queen      
  you want to be your partner.  

217
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:04,731
    Briana, which character     
          do you have?          

218
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:06,399
   - I have the Wicked Witch,   

219
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:09,068
 and I actually picked Kim Chi. 

220
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,736
           [chuckles]           

221
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:12,103
              Hi!

           [laughter]           

223
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:16,106
            - I have            
  the citizen of Emerald City,  

224
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:19,276
     and the queen I picked

225
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,776

231
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:32,117
         - I'm gonna be         
     Glinda the Good Witch,     

232
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,386
       because I'm good,        
   and sometimes I'm a witch.   

233
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:35,954

    with Mr. Derrick Barry!     

238
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:49,099
            - Whoo!             
         I love Terra!          

239
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,768
  <i> I've met Terra in the past,</i>  
 <i> and she impersonates Britney.</i>

     It's a perfect match.      

242
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:56,038
    - I have the Scarecrow,     

243

                 made in heaven.

349
00:14:48,614 --> 00:14:51,148

      knowledge of design,      

350
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,916
  there are high expectations.

00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,684
  Does that make you nervous?   

352
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,151
 - It doesn't make me nervous,  

353
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:58,520
  'cause I feel like the first  
       challenge, I won,        

354
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:00,055

00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:19,938
         - Miley Cyrus?         
            - Yeah!             

365
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,206
  She thought of the outfits,   
    and she made everything.    

366
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:24,041
        <i> So we had cones</i>        
    <i> coming from our boobs,</i>     

367
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:25,509
        all crazy stuff.        

368
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:26,776
             - Wow.             

369
00:15:26,778 --> 00:15:28,377
Thorgy, do you have any sketches
          or anything?          

370
00:15:28,379 --> 00:15:31,279
- Actually, I just--that was    
the stage we just got to.       

371
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:32,747
            - Okay.             
           All right.           

372
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:34,282
      Time is running out.      
  - I'm feeling the pressure.   

373
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:35,817
      - All right, Thorgy.      
      - Thanks a lot, Ru.       

374
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:36,817
      - Thanks, Brittney.       
          - Thank you.          

375
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,352
            - Cool.             

376
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,354
            - Hello!            
           both: Hi.            

377
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,754
 - So what do you have planned? 

378
00:15:41,756 --> 00:15:45,458
   - Well, we are the Tin Woman,
        and the Tin "Whoa, Man!"

379
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,093
           - [laughs]           

380
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:49,295
      - So I was thinking       
          of creating           

381
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,563
               elements that can
             go onto a body suit

382
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,030
         or something like that.

383
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,700
- That's great, but haven't     
you done that before?           

384
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,801
      <i> Wearing a body suit</i>      
      <i> or a bathing suit,</i>       

385
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:59,869
   and then putting something   
         on top of it?          

386
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,303
   We're looking for couture,   

387
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:03,639
something inspired              
by the Tin Woodsman,            

388
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:04,873
so take it from there.          

389
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,541
        - I don't handle        
       losing very well,        

390
00:16:06,543 --> 00:16:08,976
    so I will give this 120.    

391
00:16:08,978 --> 00:16:11,345
- Well, you say that while      
you have a hatchet in your hand.

392
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,712
That kind of scares me.         

393
00:16:12,714 --> 00:16:14,013
           [laughter]           

394
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,313
All right, well, I'm gonna      
let you get to it.              

395
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,515
                       - [sighs]
    Now I have to rethink ideas.

396
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,917
          That really scares me.

397
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,084
            Oh, God.            

398
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:24,018
      - All right, ladies,      
         gather round.          

399
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,621
     Gather round, ladies.      

400
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:31,058
   Now tomorrow, in addition    
  to your runway presentation,  

401
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,994
   I want each duo to perform   

402
00:16:33,996 --> 00:16:36,595
  a dreamy interpretive dance   

403
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,731
     set in a poppy field.      

404
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,232
           Of course.           

405
00:16:41,234 --> 00:17:13,931
            [laughs]            

406
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,599
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

407
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,834
        <i> [upbeat music]</i>         

408
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,604
  - This week's maxi-challenge  
          is makeovers          

409
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,338
        <i> for the cast of</i>        
      <i> "Little Women: LA."</i>      

410
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,673
- They're looking like they're  
getting creative over there.    

411
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,774
          - Which one?          
        Oh, the Tin Man?        

412
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,141
           - Mm-hmm.            

413
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:29,309
  - I wouldn't be too worried   
         about Derrick.         

414
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:31,011
   - All right, let's do it.    
            - Okay.             

415
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,646
       - We're sleeping.        

416
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:33,746
    - Are we gonna lay down?    
            - Yeah.             

417
00:17:33,748 --> 00:17:35,314
       - This whole time?       
            - Yeah.             

418
00:17:35,316 --> 00:17:37,983
 It's finally time to rehearse  
our interpretive dance routine. 

419
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:41,452
   To ask the question "Do I    
understand interpretive dance?" 

420
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:46,223
      is to ask "Do I know      
    the entire pi formula?"     

421
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:49,960
     And the answer is no.      

422
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,128
 - I woke up with a nightmare.  

423
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,131
      His face looks like       
he's going for a dental checkup.

424
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:57,365
         - Oh, my God.          

425
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,467
Terra, you belong here with us. 
           - [laughs]           

426
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:00,401
             - Pow!             

427
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:04,803
     - Girl, what the hell      
         are you doing?         

428
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,673
   Like, she's just slapping    
    her little lady around.     

429
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:09,675
                - Fucking bitch!

430
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:11,276
- You gonna get a charge, girl. 

431
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:13,211
You beating up on a little lady.

432
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,145
             - Oh!              

433
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:17,481
    - I'm guessing we should    
     just play up the fact      

434
00:18:17,483 --> 00:18:19,081
     that we're scarecrows.     
            - Okay.             

435
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:21,316
       - And maybe we can, like,
         do like a cross, like--

436
00:18:21,318 --> 00:18:23,985
 - Should I go in front of you? 
            - Sure.             

437
00:18:23,987 --> 00:18:26,620
        - And then it looks like
           you put that leg out.

438
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:30,089
- I don't know what to do.      
What's interpretive dance?      

439
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,191
            - Uh...             

440
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:34,058
            - Uh oh.            
     The Scarecrow people.      

441
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,593
- Are they practicing?          
What they doing?                

442
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:36,927
         - No, they both staring
                  at each other,

443
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:37,928
    trying to figure it out.    
           [laughter]           

444
00:18:39,097 --> 00:18:40,695
  - He ain't no choreographer.  

445
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:41,996
        He don't dance.         

446
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:44,030
He was in the bottom last week. 
            - Uh oh.            

447
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:46,399
       - This is his time       
     to, like, step it up.      

448
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:48,668
 - I have no idea what the fuck 
     we're supposed to do.      

449
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,736
     - "What do you think?"     
      "What do you think?"      

450
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:52,704
      "What do you think?"      
     - "What do you think?"

452
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:56,540
      - Y'all better stop       
   thinking and start doing.    

453
00:18:56,542 --> 00:18:58,375
            [laughs]            

454
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:01,077
         - I love you.          
          [both laugh]

       [machine stalling]       

456
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:09,083
      Why is this machine       
         being a dick?          

457
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,952
       [machine stalling]       
          Oh, my God.           

458
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:14,087
       Do you want to see       
  something completely insane?  

459
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,888
                       - [gasps]
                  What the fuck?

460
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,189
                 Why did you sew
                   it like this?

461
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:18,456
               I don't even know
               how you did this.

462
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,490
- No, I don't either.           

463
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,691
Isn't that bizarre?             

464
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,625
     Apparently this fabric     
       cannot be sewn on.       

465
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,494
      So we've gone from a      
     beautiful, regal cape,     

466
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:30,799
  to making bustles to give us  
     sort of a regal flair.     

467
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:31,799
      I want to scream.         

468
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,568
My brain just exploded.         

469
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:37,504
          - [screams]           

470
00:19:37,506 --> 00:19:40,540
           Oh, shit!            
           [laughter]           

471
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:41,840
         - Yes, indeed.         

472
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:43,241
Our little hot glue skirt       
turned out good.                

473
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,608
                      - [laughs]

474
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,144
    - I'm pretty much done.     
   I have a complete product    

475
00:19:47,146 --> 00:19:48,945
  <i> and I'm feeling good today.</i>  

476
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:50,513
        - This working?         
         - Yes, ma'am.          

477
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:52,481
      It's not gathering?       
     - I'm right on track.      

478
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,049
            - Okay.             
       - Yeah, it's done.       

479
00:19:55,618 --> 00:19:57,685
            - What?             
       We're all working,       

480
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,453
        <i> and she's done.</i>        

481

       <i> Do something more</i>       
        <i> to your outfit.</i>        

482
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:03,924
       Because it doesn't       
        look that great.        

483
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,859
   - Come on, Disco Dorothy.    
           - [laughs]           

484
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:09,929
   - I almost want to go over   
     there, like, "Hello?"

         for your baby.         

550

help her deal with it.

00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:31,668
     She's average height,      
             and so             

553
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,837
I was really hard on her, 'cause
I had to gain that respect.     

554

            - Yeah.             
       - At an early age,       

555
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,638
because I knew by the time      
she was seven or eight,         

556
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,172
she was gonna be                
taller than me.

    but I did sew everything    
            on here.

00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,761
          That is not           
      a Britney reference.      

727
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,662
 - I have watched you in Vegas. 

728
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,263
          I know what           
       you're capable of,       

729
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,031
 and it just sort of saddens me 

730
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:40,034
   because you're better than   
  what you just did up there.   

731
00:30:40,036 --> 00:30:42,802
       - Next up, Robbie        
       and Hedda Turner.        

732
00:30:42,804 --> 00:30:45,137
 - I literally don't even know  
          what to make          

733
00:30:45,139 --> 00:30:46,739
  out of what you're wearing.   

734
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:49,774
   Bustles can be flattering    
  when they're on a big gown.   

735
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:53,244
  This looks like just a bunch  
  of ruched up fabric stuck--   

736
00:30:53,246 --> 00:30:55,646
      And we have to work       
       on that hairline.        

737
00:30:55,648 --> 00:30:57,313
     - I guess I'm a little     
        more old school.        

738
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,915
      I come from big ol'       
     Christian hair women.      

739
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:02,217
       - Even Jan Crouch        
     found a way to blend.      

740
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,886
           - [laughs]           
           - Robbie!            

741
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:06,988
    We're at this point now.    
  It's, like, so frustrating,   

742
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,689
  because you are so talented   

743
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:11,958
       and all we want is       
      for you to bring it.      

744
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,160
     And we're missing it.      

745
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:17,529
      - All right, Kim Chi      
         and Miso Chi.          

746
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:19,831
   - I got a Kimbra, Feller,    

747
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:23,201
     "Voluptuous Horror of      
   Karen Black" sort of vibe,   

748
00:31:23,203 --> 00:31:24,669
  and the look was fantastic.   

749
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:26,503
    <i> - I loved the beginning</i>    
         <i> runway walk,</i>          

750
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:29,639
       even though it was       
        a little wobbly.        

751
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:33,910
  You had a complete concept.   
       Great job tonight.       

752
00:31:33,912 --> 00:31:37,579
     - Next up, Thorgy Thor     
         and Thorgeous.         

753
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:39,614
- What I was                    
charmed by, really,             

754
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:43,183
   was when you eased on down   
the road into your dance moves. 

755
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:45,351
      - Your look tonight,      
   I thought it was cohesive,   

756
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:47,219
     but it didn't wow me.      

757
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,521
  I'm not gonna remember in a   
 few weeks, driving in traffic, 

758
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:51,589
       thinking "Oh, God,       
      remember that look?"      

759
00:31:51,591 --> 00:31:53,323
           You know?            

760
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:56,626
           - Ladies,            
      one final question:       

761
00:31:56,628 --> 00:32:01,865
  who deserves to click their   
  heels and go back to Kansas?  

762
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:05,835
 Starting with Chi Chi DeVayne. 
       - [blows out air]        

763
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:09,304
    I'm sorry, Derrick, but     
 your outfit to me, was just... 

764
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:10,905
         a train wreck.         

765
00:32:10,907 --> 00:32:12,840
     - Bob The Drag Queen.      
  - Based off this challenge,   

766
00:32:12,842 --> 00:32:14,574
 I would pick Derrick as well.  
            - Naomi.            

767
00:32:14,576 --> 00:32:18,310
 - Based on execution, I would  
  probably say Derrick's too.   

768
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,745
           - Derrick.           
      - Well, I would say       

769
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:21,179
         all three that said me,

770
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:22,947
       but I know I have        
          to pick one.          

771
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:25,349
     I would say Chi Chi's.     
    It's hot-glued together.    

772
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:27,484
        It's cut fabric         
        with no detail.         

773
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,152
        - What say you,         
         Robbie Turner?         

774
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:33,122
       - Chi Chi's didn't       
    scream "Dorothy" to me.     

775
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:34,490
           - Kim Chi?           
         - I love her,          

776
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:36,125
 but I'm going to say Chi Chi,  
          only because          

777
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:37,960
    yesterday, when everyone    
     was just working hard,     

778
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:39,527
  she was just sitting there,   
      and that was a time       

779
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,196
      that she could have       
      spent on her outfit.      

780
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:42,363
             Sorry.             

781
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:43,931
   - Thorgy Thor, you're up.    

782
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,232
 - Kim Chi, you literally said  
every word that I was gonna say.

783
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:47,833
  I think in this competition   
       you have to apply        

784
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,868
      every single second       
      and I'm here to win,      

785
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:53,338
         so people like         
      Chi Chi piss me off.      

786
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,973
 - Yes, I did have extra time,  

787
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,841
     because I did hot glue     
           my outfit,           

788
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:59,343
       but I did what was       
     in my range of doing.      

789
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:03,880
  But that's how they feel, so  
   I respect y'all's opinion.   

790
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:06,249
   - All right, I think we've   
     heard enough, ladies.      

791
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,216
  While you untuck backstage,   

792
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:12,154
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

793
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,090
        Just between us         
      friends of Dorothy,       

794
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:16,324
       what do you think?

00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,925
       <i> Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>        

796
00:33:17,927 --> 00:33:20,527
  - I really didn't care about  
  the hot glue gun conspiracy,  

797
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:21,828
        issue, whatever.        
           [laughter]

          - Gluegate!           

799
00:33:23,532 --> 00:33:26,365
  - You know, there's a lot of  
   hot glue gunning going on,   

800
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:28,099
     even at the Met Ball.      
           - Really?            

801
00:33:28,101 --> 00:33:29,600
         - I don't want         
      to name names, but--      

802
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:31,869
      - Please name names!      
          - Please do!          

803
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,236

  that outfit, at this point,
