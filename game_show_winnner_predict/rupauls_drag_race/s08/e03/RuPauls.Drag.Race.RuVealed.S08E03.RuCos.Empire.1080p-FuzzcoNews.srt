1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,601
Hola, señoritas.

2
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:05,804
The drag-apella movie,
<i>"Bitch Perfect."</i>

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,338
<i>Now sissy that walk</i>

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,339
Brava.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,841
Chi Chi DeVayne,
condragulations,

6
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:11,543
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

7
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,378
Shreveport, represent.

8
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:14,779
Dax ExclamationPoint,

9
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,681
Laila McQueen,

10
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,551
neither one of you survived
that lip sync.

11
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,387
Ooh, double whammy!
Bam bam.

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,057
Sashay away.

13
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:28,561
People come and go
so quickly here.

14
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:35,404
Honey, at this rate,
we gon' run out of lipstick.

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,809
Oh, my God.
Oh!

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,178
Is drag PTSD
even a thing?

17
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,880
Post-Traumatic
Sashay Disorder.

18
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:47,850
Bitch,
you better own it.

19
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,453
<i>This is a wakeup call
for all of us.</i>

20
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,822
If you ain't stepping
that pussy up,

21
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:54,690
your ass is going home.

22
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:56,592
So who do you guys think
that RuPaul called?

23
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:57,693
Her dealer.

24
00:00:57,694 --> 00:01:00,596
I had to eliminate
two queens today.

25
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:02,532
How soon can you get here?

26
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:06,369
One queen who needs
to be redeemed

27
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,670
more than any queen
on the "Drag Race"

28
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:09,205
is Victoria "Pork Chop" Parker.

29
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:11,040
Question is
when Shangela returns,

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,208
what are we gonna do?

31
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,542
Hide.

32
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:15,444
I think we should all agree
that whoever the girl

33
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,113
that comes in,
we just ignore her

34
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:18,347
and treat her like poo.

35
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:21,617
Poo unto others as you would
have them poo unto you.

36
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:23,085
We have another bitch
coming into the competition?

37
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,990
Girl, this is
some bullshit.

38
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,628
And this is a new episode of
"RuPaul's Drag Race: RuVealed."

39
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:35,931
Tonight, get ready
for some prime time drama.

40
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,266
Is somebody
coming back?

41
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:38,834
Are two more people
getting chopped?

42
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:40,736
It's like a soap opera
up in here.

43
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,171
Funny you should
say that.

44
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:44,807
<i>Guest judges
"Empire's" Tasha Smith</i>

45
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:48,144
<i>and the legendary
Faith Evans!</i>

46
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,478
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

47
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,448
<i>May the best woman,
best woman win</i>

48
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,054
Work.
Work.

49
00:01:59,456 --> 00:02:01,090
It's a brand-new day!

50
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,491
We've survived.

51
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,928
<i>Ooh, girl.</i>
We're gonna find out now.

52
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,532
<i>She done already
done had herses.</i>

53
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,867
<i>To be America's
next drag superstar,</i>

54
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,602
<i>you don't need
to be humble.</i>

55
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:14,603
Agreed.

56
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,338
<i>But if you trip or stumble,</i>

57
00:02:16,339 --> 00:02:20,376
<i>well, honey, that's just
the way that cookie crumbles.</i>

58
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:23,679
Cookie?
Is this a baking challenge?

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,482
Hello, hello, hello.

60
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,418
Wow!
This is the outfit.

61
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:30,486
Why, thank you.

62
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:33,089
It is
a Klein Epstein & Parker suit.

63
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,323
They're made to measure.

64
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:36,559
Oh!
Shameless.

65
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,562
When the Supreme Court
legalized same sex marriage,

66
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:42,431
they moved this country
boldly forward.

67
00:02:42,432 --> 00:02:45,401
But when it comes
to their sense of style,

68
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:49,372
the justices are,
like, so 18th century.

69
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:50,406
Yeah.

70
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,808
Oh, Pit Crew!

71
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,276
Whoo!
Oh!

72
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,045
Now for today's
mini challenge,

73
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:59,715
I want you to drag up
these basic black robes.

74
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:01,717
Think Judge Judy Couture.

75
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,519
We'll take a 30-minute recess,

76
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,858
and then, the Supreme Court
Fashion Show will be in session.

77
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:09,892
Go!

78
00:03:09,893 --> 00:03:11,093
Ah!

79
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:12,595
Who's down with RBG?

80
00:03:12,596 --> 00:03:14,029
Yeah, you know me.

81
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,432
Absolute garbage,
and I love it.

82
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:19,502
Ladies!
Time's up.

83
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:22,705
Category is,
Supreme Court Realness.

84
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:25,508
Order in the courtroom,
hunty!

85
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,309
Bob The Drag Queen.

86
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,745
She received
her law degree online

87
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:33,516
from the Tyler Perry "I Can
Learn Law All By Myself" school.

88
00:03:33,517 --> 00:03:36,318
Viola Davis <i>is</i> Clarence Thomas.

89
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,320
Naomi Smalls

90
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:43,092
from the law firm
of Evangelista and Fangs.

91
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:45,461
She almost got disbarred

92
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:49,365
for excessive mouth pops.

93
00:03:49,366 --> 00:03:51,133
That was only one.

94
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:58,174
Justice Derrick Barry.

95
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,609
She was inspired to study law

96
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,280
after sneaking into a matinee
of "Legally Blonde."

97
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:05,281
Oh!

98
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:06,315
Oh, and then my wig come off.

99
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:07,383
Objection.

100
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:10,086
All rise
for Supreme Court Justice

101
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:14,056
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
AKA Cuckoo Freedom.

102
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:15,991
I love her but she ain't right
in the head.

103
00:04:15,992 --> 00:04:18,694
She made herstory
with her landmark verdict

104
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:21,297
for legalizing sex.

105
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,734
Really, Judge?

106
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,402
I think it was funny.

107
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:31,674
Supreme Court Justice
Acid Betty.

108
00:04:31,675 --> 00:04:34,643
She believes
in every citizen's right

109
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,045
to go fisting.

110
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:37,046
You do you, girl.

111
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:38,147
"Go fishing."

112
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:43,719
Supreme Court Justice
Robbie Turner.

113
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,288
If Justice Turner
had her way,

114
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:49,392
she'd outlaw
ex-boyfriend Donald Trump.

115
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:50,960
I second that emotion.

116
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:53,629
All rise
for Supreme Court Justice

117
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,398
Kim Chi.

118
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,269
She got her start at the law
firm of Ching Chang & Chong.

119
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,438
I did not write these.

120
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,740
Do not send me letters.

121
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:05,775
Sorry about it.

122
00:05:05,776 --> 00:05:07,610
Supreme Court Justice
Thorgy Thor.

123
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,080
She made herstory
legalizing the right

124
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,982
to stop traffic
and tap-dance.

125
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:17,953
All rise
for Supreme Court Justice

126
00:05:17,954 --> 00:05:19,321
Chi Chi DeVayne.

127
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:22,024
She made herstory
with her landmark verdict

128
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:24,493
legalizing ass clapping.

129
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:26,796
Judge Hatchett,
meet Judge Ratchet.

130
00:05:26,797 --> 00:05:29,965
Yes, Your Honor, yes.

131
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,902
If justice is blind,
that bitch is missing out.

132
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:36,238
The winner is...

133
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:38,774
Naomi Smalls.

134
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:41,377
Yes, baby.
Fashion rules.

135
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:43,946
And I'll be posting
all of these supreme looks

136
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:46,148
at logotv.com.

137
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:48,984
Ladies, last week's
double elimination

138
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:53,589
left a void
that I've decided to fill

139
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,791
with the one and only...

140
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:58,894
Jiggly Caliente!

141
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,897
Bitches, I'm back!

142
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,268
Naysha Lopez.

143
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:08,738
Oh, my God,
it's Naysha!

144
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:11,273
She's back on the competition.

145
00:06:11,274 --> 00:06:13,142
Naysha should have walked in
with her luggage

146
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,478
and just kept on walking.

147
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:16,645
Bye, girl.

148
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,648
Naysha, you're getting
a second chance.

149
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,318
So don't fuck it up.
Okay.

150
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,820
Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

151
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:29,825
you'll be overacting
in a pilot for my new TV series,

152
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:31,260
"RuCo's Empire."

153
00:06:32,462 --> 00:06:34,830
#DragEmpire

154
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:36,999
Whoo!

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,035
That's right,
RuRu kitty girls.

156
00:06:39,036 --> 00:06:40,503
It's cookie time.

157
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:42,405
Whoo!
I love it!

158
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:45,474
Naomi Smalls,
you won the mini challenge,

159
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:47,376
so you're a team captain.

160
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:51,280
And Naysha Lopez,
as a welcome back gift,

161
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,315
you're a team captain too.

162
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,084
<i>I'm not trying to fuck up
my second chance,</i>

163
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,419
so let's do this.

164
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,255
Naomi,
you get first pick.

165
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:02,024
I choose Robbie Turner.
All right.

166
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:03,659
Naysha.

167
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,761
Derrick Barry.
Yay!

168
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:09,065
Bob The Drag Queen.
Whoo!

169
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,033
Thorgy.
Yes!

170
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:13,035
Awesome.
Whoo!

171
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,937
Chi Chi.
Whoo.

172
00:07:14,938 --> 00:07:16,806
Kim Chi.
Yeah!

173
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:20,810
Well, that leaves Acid Betty
and "Santee Alley" Fontaine.

174
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:22,812
When Cynthia Lee
says her own name,

175
00:07:22,813 --> 00:07:25,414
my ear hears
"Santee Alley,"

176
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:28,517
which is a shopping district
in downtown Los Angeles.

177
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,618
You are on Naysha's team.

178
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:31,754
Fuck.

179
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,590
Just kidding.

180
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:37,626
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

181
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:40,564
And may
the smartest cookie win.

182
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,133
Okay, so let's go through
all of them real quick.

183
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:47,036
"Ginger Snap,
classic militant activist."

184
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:50,239
She's intense, so you want
to take that role?

185
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,640
Uh...

186
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,410
<i>Derrick's playing
this militant lesbian.</i>

187
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:55,878
Really?

188
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,148
"Chocolate Chip Cookie,
the over-the-top super diva.

189
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:01,617
She's got major attitude
and blingy style."

190
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:02,785
I will feel comfortable

191
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,687
with Chocolate Chip Cookie,
personally.

192
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:05,855
There's a lot of words
in this.

193
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:08,691
Did you look at the script?

194
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,594
That's right,
Chocolate Chip Cookie's back!

195
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:14,263
I did not understand at all
what you said.

196
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:15,431
And this gonna be my chance

197
00:08:15,432 --> 00:08:17,133
to win back Rucious for good!

198
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:19,735
Why are you talking up here
like that?

199
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:21,670
<i>Think the other team
should be worried</i>

200
00:08:21,671 --> 00:08:25,908
because they have a lot of girls
that are just like...

201
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:27,943
not black.

202
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:29,945
Y'all ain't getting nuttin'
past Chi Chi.

203
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:30,946
<i>Coming up...</i>

204
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:32,014
Action.

205
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,115
I'm here to get
what's mine.

206
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:35,217
Bitch!
You couldn't even make bail.

207
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:39,022
I'm a strong gay woman!

208
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:41,991
Okay.

209
00:08:41,992 --> 00:08:43,860
"Oh-ker"?
We'll be right back.

210
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:48,702
We're back.
Lights, camera, slap him.

211
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:52,506
"You double-crossing bitches."

212
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:53,907
<i>For today's challenge,</i>

213
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,377
we have to perform in scenes
inspired by the show, "Empire."

214
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:59,947
<i>It's got drama.
It's got Cookie.</i>

215
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,815
I mean,
this is a dream come true.

216
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:04,118
<i>"Maybe it was a lil'
somethin'-somethin' extra</i>

217
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,620
I put in the drink."

218
00:09:06,621 --> 00:09:09,890
<i>I've never seen "Empire," but
Cookie sounds like a handful.</i>

219
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:11,492
And Bob is a fucking handful,

220
00:09:11,493 --> 00:09:14,094
so it's just a match
made in heaven.

221
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,729
One thing I would say,

222
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,799
make it, like
a <i>"Or</i> maybe..."

223
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,801
Let's do it again.
'Cause it got lost.

224
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:22,903
Robbie,
she's a trained actress

225
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:25,339
and she's giving us
all these tips.

226
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,442
Like, this whole thing,
and then be like,

227
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,511
"Stand back, bitches!"

228
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:33,615
We're definitely
gonna win this challenge.

229
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:35,883
"What you want?

230
00:09:35,884 --> 00:09:38,285
Oh, hello, Rucious's doctor."

231
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,555
It's Rucious's doctor.

232
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:46,160
This is one stale-ass
Chocolate Chip Cookie.

233
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,629
Just an observation
that I'm just making,

234
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,566
Thorgy and...
Kim Chi switch.

235
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:54,735
Okay, give her
the CableACE Award.

236
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,370
I would love to.
Yeah, super diva.

237
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,939
This is gonna be so good.
I really want to do this.

238
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,874
"Oh, you better think again,
RuRu kitty.

239
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,144
That's right;
Chocolate Chip Cookie is back."

240
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,413
"Did I hear my name?"

241
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:08,315
It sounded
like Bob was doing...

242
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,483
Of course.
Yeah.

243
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,185
We're gonna be up
against each other.

244
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:12,820
What part did you pick, Bob?

245
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,388
Chocolate Chip Cookie.

246
00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:16,657
Of course
both myself and Bob

247
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,592
are playing
Chocolate Chip Cookie parts,

248
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:19,893
and we're gonna be compared.

249
00:10:19,894 --> 00:10:22,196
Okay, New York.
it's like a subway series

250
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:23,263
with cookies.

251
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:24,465
"I am not worried
about that."

252
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:26,700
"Well, where the hell
is Rucious? Rucious!"

253
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:28,202
<i>There's a fire under my ass.</i>

254
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,603
Ooh!

255
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:31,606
And I really, really fucking
want to win the challenge.

256
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:38,045
Welcome to my home.

257
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,414
All right.
Team Naysha.

258
00:10:40,415 --> 00:10:41,915
<i>It's time to shoot the scene,</i>

259
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,853
and everyone's feeling
a little nervous.

260
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,622
Welcome to our beautiful set,

261
00:10:48,623 --> 00:10:52,026
furnished by our friends
at Rrivre Works.

262
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:55,562
And say hello
to my co-director.

263
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:58,999
Grammy award-winning
First Lady of hip-hop,

264
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,434
Faith Evans is here.

265
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,636
'Cause you gotta have faith.

266
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:03,937
What's up?

267
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,241
Mm-hmm.

268
00:11:07,242 --> 00:11:09,576
All right, places,
people, places.

269
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:11,378
It takes a village, people.

270
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,681
Village People?
Is the cop here?

271
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,883
And...
Action.

272
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,317
I'm here to get what's mine.

273
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:19,386
No, you're not.
Yes, she is.

274
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,587
Who are you?

275
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,056
Stop interrupting me.

276
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,157
Acting!

277
00:11:23,158 --> 00:11:25,392
You all need to chill.

278
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,296
The big RuCo white party
is coming up.

279
00:11:29,864 --> 00:11:31,465
And cut.

280
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:33,834
Kim Chi,
I need to see more of this.

281
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,636
I need to see this.

282
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,938
We smack a lot
when we ratchet.

283
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:39,006
All right.

284
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:40,607
Girl.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

285
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,908
What she said.

286
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:44,411
Like this.

287
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,351
Um...yeah.

288
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:51,685
Let's try that again.

289
00:11:51,686 --> 00:11:53,554
Listen, Ho Ho!

290
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:56,590
Chocolate Chip Cookie's
supposed to be in jail!

291
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,061
That was much better.

292
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:03,030
And action.

293
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:04,465
I'm gonna make you a star.

294
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,900
Bitch, you couldn't
even make bail.

295
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:08,936
Ooh...

296
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:12,206
But I can whoop yo' ass.

297
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,476
I believe her.

298
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,947
<i>Nobody wants a bitch who
gets kicked off to come back,</i>

299
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,715
so I was glad to beat
the shit out of her

300
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:22,783
with this dirty broom.

301
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,651
Live your truth, girl.

302
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:28,756
The White party is the time
for me to tell the whole world,

303
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:31,225
it's okay to be gay.

304
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:32,426
Cut.

305
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:34,828
Derrick, I'm losing you
in that moment.

306
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:37,631
I know--you're not sort of
connecting with anyone.

307
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,434
Just make sure
that you command the room.

308
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,769
Okay.

309
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,939
The White Party is the time
for me to tell the whole world,

310
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,010
that it's okay--

311
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,247
It's okay to be gay.

312
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,783
What the hell
is Derrick doing?

313
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,584
<i>She's lost in an afro.</i>

314
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,153
<i>She's not funny.</i>

315
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,222
Come on, Britney.
Step it up.

316
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,293
Team Naomi.

317
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:09,163
This team actually has
black people.

318
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:10,297
Crazy!

319
00:13:10,298 --> 00:13:11,298
Hi, ladies.

320
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:14,435
This Notorious B.I.G.'s wife.

321
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:17,204
<i>I got my drag name
from Biggie Smalls,</i>

322
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:19,373
so I'm fucking freaking out.

323
00:13:19,374 --> 00:13:21,175
It's "Smalls in the Family."

324
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,476
Lived this life,

325
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:24,144
so if you have
any questions for her

326
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:26,313
in terms of character
or inspiration...

327
00:13:26,314 --> 00:13:28,182
What's the best hand
to slap a hoe with,

328
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,616
like, the left or the right?

329
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,286
Best question of the season
so far.

330
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,189
All right, so places,
people, <i>places.</i>

331
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,290
Action.

332
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:39,259
Now where the hell is Rucious?
Rucious!

333
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,197
Rucious probably smelled you
and went runnin'.

334
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,666
Well, then why
did I waste my time

335
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,235
puttin' on this?
Ooh!

336
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:49,703
Bam!

337
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:52,539
Why you all gaggin'?

338
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,975
I bring it to you
every episode.

339
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,810
Cut.

340
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,979
<i>You say this is
an over-acting challenge,</i>

341
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,548
I'm like,

342
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,450
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

343
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,685
Action.

344
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:06,553
<i>Yo, yo, yo,
hallelu, hallelu</i>

345
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,256
<i>My name's Shortbread,
that's my girl, Macaroon</i>

346
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:14,094
And that's why they need
a strong woman on this company.

347
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:15,329
Cut.

348
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,899
Miss Cynthia Lee, you just
left out the word "gay,"

349
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,168
when you said this company needs
a strong, gay woman.

350
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,403
Strong, gay woman.

351
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,339
Yes, because that's--
that's the joke.

352
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,574
Okay, let's try that again.

353
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,878
This company need
a gay, strong woman.

354
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,879
Wait, cut.

355
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,580
The line is,
"A strong, gay woman."

356
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,915
"Strong, gay woman."

357
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:39,119
I'm a strong, gay woman!

358
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,488
<i>Cynthia's Ginger Snap
is hilarious</i>

359
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,924
for all the wrong reasons.

360
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,094
I don't even know if she knows
what she's saying.

361
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,264
All right.
Let's move on.

362
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,533
That and how to shoplift.

363
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:55,069
Empty your pockets,
please, ma'am.

364
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,338
Fuck line.

365
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,373
Robbie, differentiate
those voices,

366
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:01,542
so that we know
it's two different people.

367
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,410
Do want it, like,
satanic or something?

368
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,913
Um, not today, Satan.

369
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:08,015
Just make them different.
Okay.

370
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:10,017
That and how to shoplift.

371
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:12,886
Please, sir, empty your--

372
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,589
Please ma'am,
will you empty your pocketbook?

373
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,957
Ah!

374
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,693
Robbie is really
screwing it up.

375
00:15:19,694 --> 00:15:21,762
<i>You're the one
I was most confident in.</i>

376
00:15:21,763 --> 00:15:23,630
We're gonna have to work
with what we have.

377
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,401
We could end up losing this
because of Robbie's mistakes.

378
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:29,136
<i>Coming up...</i>

379
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,272
The girls are gonna do
a runway in roller skates.

380
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:34,308
I've never skated before.
Really?

381
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,112
This is a mess
I can't wait to see.

382
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:39,179
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

383
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,883
Be right back.

384
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,401
We're back.

385
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,070
Let's get this main stage
rolling, honey.

386
00:15:50,106 --> 00:15:52,741
For the first time
in drag herstory,

387
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:56,612
the girls are gonna do
a runway in roller skates.

388
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,148
Finally, a legit use
for my kneepads.

389
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:00,549
So anybody nervous
about skating?

390
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,950
I've never skated before.

391
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:02,951
Ru?

392
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,119
Ever.

393
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,687
So since I can't skate,
I have this idea,

394
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:08,390
like, maybe I can, like,
turn into a car

395
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,858
to, like, mask it.

396
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,960
Do you have, like,
wheels for your arms and stuff?

397
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:13,629
Oh, I have to make
my wheels, so.

398
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,631
You have to make wheels?
Yeah.

399
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,332
So he plans on falling
and what,

400
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:20,602
crawling across the stage
like a Transformer?

401
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:23,940
What?
Word, Decepticon, yes!

402
00:16:26,042 --> 00:16:27,409
How you feelin', Robbie?

403
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,746
I feel...actually...
better.

404
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:34,850
Girl, I'm the disco rockin' diva
of the roller rink.

405
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:37,820
And my hope is that
my runway look redeems me

406
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:41,156
from that horrible performance
in the acting challenge.

407
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:43,225
I'm actually wearing my mom's
vintage sunglasses,

408
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,060
which I'm really excited about.

409
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,496
My parents were
straight-up hippies.

410
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,665
I would love,
love to meet your parents.

411
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,500
My mom, uh, passed away

412
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,368
when I was 19.

413
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,204
What happened?
She had cancer.

414
00:16:56,372 --> 00:16:57,973
I was at college,
like, having a blast,

415
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,341
and, like, I would always call
and be like,

416
00:16:59,342 --> 00:17:01,477
"How's everything?"
It was always fine.

417
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,611
But it wasn't.

418
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:05,013
And I finally got a call
from my dad being like,

419
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,015
"You know, you should probably
really come home."

420
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:09,218
When I went home, I mean,
she was not the--

421
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:12,621
She was not a person.
She...

422
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:14,022
She wasn't there.

423
00:17:14,023 --> 00:17:15,791
I wish they were just a little
bit more honest with me,

424
00:17:15,792 --> 00:17:17,392
'cause when I got home,
she died that day.

425
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:19,328
Oh, my God!

426
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:23,332
She was a skeleton
in a hospital bed.

427
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,368
<i>I didn't really get
a good-bye.</i>

428
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:29,571
<i>And I kinda feel like
that was taken from me.</i>

429
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:30,873
And I'm very angry about it,

430
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:34,243
but I don't know
where to put that anger.

431
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:35,878
It comes out of love for my dad,
he's like,

432
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,913
"I just don't want to, like,
interrupt your life and ruin--

433
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:38,914
Like, I want better things
for you."

434
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:40,082
And I'm like, I get that...

435
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,083
And my parents wanted
to protect me," yeah.

436
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,151
But things like that,
like,

437
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,186
I didn't get to say
good-bye to her.

438
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,754
She didn't want
to make my dad and my sister

439
00:17:45,755 --> 00:17:49,958
feel, like, terrible,
but...

440
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:52,828
How come they didn't, like,
tell me to come home?

441
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:58,801
I will never forget that day.

442
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:00,736
I guess that's why
I talk about things so much.

443
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:03,405
Just get it over with.
That's a great idea.

444
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:04,406
Keep doing that.

445
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,208
Honey, we are here
to listen.

446
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:10,779
We got you.
Now, let's hit the stage.

447
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,854
Honey, y'all are not
ready for this.

448
00:18:22,459 --> 00:18:23,792
<i>Cover girl
Yeah!</i>

449
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:26,095
<i>Put the bass in your walk</i>

450
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:28,263
<i>Don't be jealous</i>
of my roller boogie.

451
00:18:28,264 --> 00:18:30,399
<i>Let your whole body talk</i>

452
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,301
<i>And what?</i>

453
00:18:32,302 --> 00:18:34,236
Yeah!

454
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:37,639
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

455
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,010
Michelle Visage, thanks
for helping me build my empire.

456
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:44,947
How was prison?

457
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:47,683
Fashion superstar
Carson Kressley,

458
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:49,485
what's your favorite cookie?

459
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:52,988
I like those Samoans.
It's a Samoa.

460
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:55,424
Oh, is it a Samoa?
Samoan is a person.

461
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,659
Mmm, mmm, delicious.

462
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,463
From the hit shows,
"Empire" and "Power,"

463
00:19:01,464 --> 00:19:05,067
my acting class pal,
Tasha Smith is here.

464
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:08,337
Hey, baby!
Hey!

465
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:11,473
And the legendary Faith Evans.

466
00:19:11,474 --> 00:19:12,574
Hey, Ru.

467
00:19:12,575 --> 00:19:14,543
Were you mesmerized
by my girls?

468
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:17,179
Oh, my, was I.

469
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,248
This week,
we challenged our queens

470
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:22,818
to act up a storm
in "RuCo's Empire."

471
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:26,321
Tonight, for the first time
in drag race herstory,

472
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:29,725
category is
Roller Girl Realness.

473
00:19:29,726 --> 00:19:30,793
I'm ready.

474
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,995
Gentlemen,
start your roller skates.

475
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,431
And may the best woman win!

476
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,668
Get ready for some
moving violations.

477
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:40,903
Queens on wheels.

478
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:43,105
AKA "wheelness."

479
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,640
You're giving us
Tamar Braxton.

480
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,475
And Adrienne Bailon.
Mm-hmm.

481
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,445
<i>I'm giving you "Xanadu"
realness, boo.</i>

482
00:19:49,446 --> 00:19:50,946
<i>Next thing you know--
Oop!</i>

483
00:19:50,947 --> 00:19:52,781
Oh, yes, she "Xana-did."

484
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:56,051
If they show me falling as
my runway, I'm gonna be furious.

485
00:19:56,052 --> 00:19:57,953
Don't worry,
we had a medic on hand.

486
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:00,856
We're not totally evil
around here.

487
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,292
Thorgy Thor.

488
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:05,727
She's giving
very "Three's Company."

489
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:07,796
Come and knock on her door.

490
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:09,965
<i>I'm super comfortable
on these roller skates.</i>

491
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:12,101
<i>This is one of
the first looks I ever did,</i>

492
00:20:12,102 --> 00:20:13,769
<i>like, this is classic Thorgy.</i>

493
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,970
Hey, good-lookin'.

494
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:16,705
Be back to pick you up later.

495
00:20:16,706 --> 00:20:17,973
Call me on the party line.

496
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:19,641
Is this a three-way?

497
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:22,478
Derrick Barry.
Very Skaty Perry.

498
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,214
<i>I love my outfit.</i>

499
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,050
<i>I feel like I'm giving them
pop Princess Peach.</i>

500
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,786
<i>It's different from anything
that I've worn before.</i>

501
00:20:30,787 --> 00:20:32,054
Oh!

502
00:20:32,055 --> 00:20:34,690
That's a bubble butt
if I ever seen one.

503
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,859
Kim Chi.
Toucan!

504
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,894
Look at the size
of that cockatoo.

505
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:42,364
<i>The entire ensemble is
inspired by John Galliano.</i>

506
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:43,999
<i>It's a contrast between nude</i>

507
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,101
<i>and all the colors
that are in a parrot.</i>

508
00:20:46,102 --> 00:20:48,737
Yes, honey,
you better sissy that macaw.

509
00:20:48,738 --> 00:20:51,340
Acid Betty.
"Beyond Thunderdome."

510
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,041
<i>Punk unicorn realness.</i>

511
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:55,944
<i>I am a bitch on wheels
times ten.</i>

512
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:58,514
<i>I'm reliving my childhood
in the '80s, honey.</i>

513
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:00,349
<i>Don't turn your back on me.</i>

514
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,785
Mad Maxi Pad.
Whoa.

515
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:05,821
Naomi Smalls.
Classic beauty.

516
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:08,157
She is like a flamingo.
Yes.

517
00:21:08,158 --> 00:21:10,726
<i>I'm wearing
a pretty in pink bedroom scene.</i>

518
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,628
<i>My outfit
is so not roller girl,</i>

519
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,129
<i>but I'm pulling it off.</i>

520
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,498
Michelle, what's the hardest
part of roller skating?

521
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:17,633
Mm.

522
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:19,034
Telling your mother
that you're gay.

523
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,336
It's funny 'cause it's true.

524
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:22,504
See you later,
roller skater.

525
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:24,406
Bob The Drag Queen.

526
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,443
Not to be confused with
Bob The High School Counselor.

527
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:30,145
<i>I didn't have enough time to
finish this Transformer outfit,</i>

528
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,513
<i>so I do my backup plan.</i>

529
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:34,116
<i>I'm like "Tron,"
robot-inspired character.</i>

530
00:21:34,117 --> 00:21:36,552
She's a ro--oh, yes girl.
Uh-oh. Be careful.

531
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:37,753
<i>And I'm just like,
try to move</i>

532
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:40,022
<i>offstage without
breaking a limb.</i>

533
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,123
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

534
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:43,058
Nice save.

535
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,426
She's like a Roomba!

536
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,028
Don't go too fast now, girl.
Okay, slow down, girl.

537
00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:47,029
Don't go too fast.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

538
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,565
Oh, work it!

539
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,635
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

540
00:21:53,636 --> 00:21:55,137
She's a little bit country.

541
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,272
It's Barbara Mandrell
on wheels.

542
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:59,007
<i>I love my runway look.</i>

543
00:21:59,008 --> 00:22:00,342
<i>It's like Farrah Fawcett</i>

544
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:04,012
<i>meets with Olivia Newton John
in Texas.</i>

545
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:05,380
Uh, okay.

546
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:06,949
<i>I feel like the goddesses
of roller blades.</i>

547
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,584
If she falls,
there will be a hoe down.

548
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:10,419
There will be.

549
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,554
Chi Chi DeVayne
from Louisiana.

550
00:22:12,555 --> 00:22:14,490
Yeah, this had
a roller street part.

551
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:16,558
Yes!
She got tricks.

552
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,260
<i>I'm a disco queen, honey.</i>

553
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:22,131
<i>Funky, tight roller girl.
This is me.</i>

554
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,566
She's got that hair
snatched back in a afro puff.

555
00:22:24,567 --> 00:22:26,969
Ooh, a little
backwards skating.

556
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,204
Yeah, back rolls.

557
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:31,340
Up next, Robbie "Turnter."

558
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:32,975
Oh, lord!
All right!

559
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,243
Uh-oh!

560
00:22:34,244 --> 00:22:37,179
<i>I am roller girl realness
personified.</i>

561
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,382
<i>It's got my initials on my ass
and a little star booty.</i>

562
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:41,884
Ooh, I like her.

563
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:45,721
<i>My Aunt Diana's hair.
I scalped her in, like, 1975.</i>

564
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:48,123
It's like a rhinestone
roller girl.

565
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:50,058
Yes.
Mmm.

566
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,126
<i>Coming up...</i>

567
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:53,929
Taraji is going to die.

568
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,199
Lee Daniels is going to die.

569
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,802
Yes!

570
00:22:59,803 --> 00:23:01,103
We'll be right back.

571
00:23:02,434 --> 00:23:03,400
Hey, cookie girls,

572
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:06,103
I hope you're hungry
for some diva drama.

573
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:08,772
I'm "wheely, wheely" impressed.

574
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,343
Now it's time
to view your scenes.

575
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,879
First up, Team Naysha.

576
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:19,016
I swear I've seen this show
before.

577
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:20,317

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,960
<i>Hey, cookie girls.</i>

00:23:31,863 --> 00:23:33,998
<i>Aw, damn.

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,508
<i>Vanilla Wafer?</i>

00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,645
<i>My brilliant daughter

00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:50,481
<i>and multiple personalities,

589
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:52,550
Macaroon!

590
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,618
<i>Who thinks
she's sittin' on a secret,</i>

591
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:56,086
<i>Ginger Snap?</i>

592
00:23:56,087 --> 00:23:57,988
<i>My hood rat baby girl,</i>

<i>Shortbread?</i>

594
00:23:59,457 --> 00:24:02,693
<i>Or will it all go
to my sassy ex-wife,</i>

595
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:03,961
<i>Chocolate Chip Cookie?</i>

596
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:09,967
What?

597
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:12,303
But Chocolate Chip Cookie's
supposed to be in jail!

598
00:24:12,304 --> 00:24:14,438
Ooh!

599
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,507
You better think again,
RuRu kitty.

600
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:17,675
That's right.

601
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:19,410
Chocolate Chip Cookie's back!

602
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,078
Get off of me.

603
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,580
And I'm here
to take what's mine,

604
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:25,482
now get this orange shit
off my body.

605
00:24:27,385 --> 00:24:30,487
Ex-squeeze me?

606
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:32,990
I'm in charge of this company.

607
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:35,793
Oh, bougie bitch,
please!

608
00:24:35,794 --> 00:24:39,363
I should be running this empire.

609
00:24:39,364 --> 00:24:42,299
Who asked you?

610
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,367
I did?

611
00:24:43,368 --> 00:24:44,935
No, I didn't!

612
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:47,872
Yo, cray-cray.

My baby's got talent.

617
00:24:57,015 --> 00:25:01,752
And that's for not visiting me
in prison, bitch.

618
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,254
Stop!

619
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:06,690
It's time I get something
off my chest.

620
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:11,495
<i>This is my day
I was born this way</i>

621
00:25:11,496 --> 00:25:14,965
<i>And my biggest secret is</i>

Gay.
We know.

00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:22,406
But damn, my little baby's
got a voice.

625
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:24,675
Yeah.
I'm gonna make you a star.

626
00:25:24,676 --> 00:25:27,077
Bitch,
you couldn't even post bail.

627
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,914
No...

628
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:32,783
but I can whoop yo ass
with this!

629
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:46,096
This is harder on me
than it is for you guys.

630
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,731
No, it's not!
Ow!

631
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:49,400
Dang, she commits.

632
00:25:49,401 --> 00:25:50,801
Y'all need to chill!

633
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:53,137
The big White Record party's
comin' up,

634
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:57,241
and we need to show Rucious
that we are a family.

635
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:03,414
Oh, it's Rucious's doctor.

636
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,550
What?
Rucious is dead!

637
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:11,422
Oh, Rucious wants me
to give him head.

638
00:26:11,423 --> 00:26:13,891
How is her head?

639
00:26:13,892 --> 00:26:15,492
Be right there.

640
00:26:15,493 --> 00:26:18,062
I will see each
and every one of you bitches

641
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:20,231
at the White party.

642
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,136
Yup, that scenery got chewed,
as in ate up.

643
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:30,307
Yes, "Empire" and "Dynasty,"
we're coming for you.

644
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:32,510
Team Naomi.

645
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,179
I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

646
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:39,617
Girls, at this
damn White party,

647
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:41,151
we're gonna act like a family.

648
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,626
I know y'all ain't starting
this white-ass party without me.

649
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:51,195
And why it gotta be white,
you know?

650
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:52,530
She do got a point.

651
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:54,298
Where's Rucious?
Rucious!

652
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,801
Rucious probably smelled you
and went runnin'.

653
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:00,938
Oh, well, then
why did I waste my time.

654
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:04,408
putting on this?

655
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:05,509
Oh, there's more.

656
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,647
This-a!

657
00:27:09,648 --> 00:27:13,150
Why'd I waste my time
doin' that, bitch?

658
00:27:13,151 --> 00:27:16,053
'Cause you's a crazy ass hoe.

659
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,588
Where'd you learn
to talk like that?

660
00:27:17,589 --> 00:27:20,624
I learned it from you, bitch.

661
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:24,762
That's about the only thing
you taught us.

662
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:26,463
Yeah, that,
and how to shoplift.

663
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,132
Empty your pockets,
please, ma'am.

664
00:27:28,133 --> 00:27:29,166
I didn't do it!

665
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,135
Mama told me to!

666
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,636
Well, well.

667
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:35,339
This is nice,
but let's have a drink.

668
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:41,111
My thoughts exactly.

669
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:44,315
Before we drink,
we say grace.

670
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:46,550
Now can I get
a "Amen, hallelu"?

671
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,919
<i>Yo, yo, yo,
hallelu, hallelu</i>

672
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,355
<i>My name's Shortbread,
that's my girl, Macaroon</i>

673
00:27:51,356 --> 00:27:52,556
<i>Eat these cookie now</i>

674
00:27:52,557 --> 00:27:53,657
<i>Whatcha want do</i>

675
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:54,959
<i>And drink this milk, bitch</i>

676
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,093
<i>You know you want to</i>

677
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:57,795
All right,
I knew you had it, baby!

678
00:27:57,796 --> 00:27:58,929
Yes!
I knew you had it.

679
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,432
Stop oppressing me!
Okay.

680
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:04,034
<i>I am sickening</i>

681
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:06,504
<i>I am gorgeous</i>

682
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:10,140
I'm a strong, gay woman!

683
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:12,810
Bitch, we're all gay.

684
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:13,811
I'm not gay.

685
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:15,246
Yes, you are.

686
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:17,348
That one time
in college doesn't count.

687
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:20,050
My baby.

688
00:28:20,051 --> 00:28:21,418
Jeez!

689
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:24,588
Girl, you better step
your medications up.

690
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:28,259
Wow, you really all are crazy.

691
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,261
That's why I'm secretly
plotting to go work

692
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:32,530
for our rival company,

693
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:35,165
Lady Bunny Death Hoe Records.

694
00:28:36,168 --> 00:28:37,334
Oh, no, she didn't.

695
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:42,106
You fake-ass
Dominique Deveraux wannabe!

696
00:28:42,107 --> 00:28:43,674
Oh, my God.

697
00:28:43,675 --> 00:28:46,076
Oh! Taste it, bitch.
Expensive vodka.

698
00:28:46,077 --> 00:28:48,479
Stand back, bitches.

699
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,713
Bring it, bitch.

700
00:28:51,449 --> 00:28:53,384
You lucky
my pre-paid phone ringin'.

701
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,753
I woulda whooped
your little skinny ass.

702
00:28:55,754 --> 00:28:56,854
Who dis?

703
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:58,088
It's Rucious' doctor, y'all.

704
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,558
Hello, Rucious's doctor.

705
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,393
Wait, what?

706
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:04,662
Rucious's...

707
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:08,032
severely deadly illness is...

708
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:09,767
contagious?

709
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,238
Oh!

710
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:16,307
Oh!
It's because I'm gay?

711
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:17,608
Isn't it?

712
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:20,711
Peace.

713
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:22,546
Did anyone else notice
that these queens always die

714
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:25,249
at the end of these
acting challenges?

715
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,717
Oh...

716
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:31,789
I guess whatever Rucious had,
it really was sickening.

717
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:38,062
Or maybe it was just
a lil' extra somethin-somethin

718
00:29:38,063 --> 00:29:40,164
I put in the cocktails.

719
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,267
Oh, you thirsty, bitch?

720
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:45,803
Whoo!

721
00:29:45,804 --> 00:29:47,872
I'ma take this motherfucker.
Gimme the shoe, bitch.

722
00:29:47,873 --> 00:29:50,608
She is just making this up
as she goes along.

723
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:52,076
Oh!
Look at all this money.

724
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:54,411
He ain't got
no motherfucking backup.

725
00:29:54,412 --> 00:29:55,713
Is the train still runnin'?

726
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,020
Wow.

727
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:04,555
Well, there you have it,
ladies.

728
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:06,624
And all based on actual events.

729
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,228
Ladies, this week
you acted in teams.

730
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:14,832
but tonight,
you'll be judged individually.

731
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:17,101
Plot twist!

732
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:18,636
<i>Coming up...</i>

733
00:30:18,637 --> 00:30:20,404
I don't know what you were
saying, but I didn't care.

734
00:30:20,405 --> 00:30:23,507
I think you were
very convincing as a schizo.

735
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:26,043
Show me that you do have soul.

736
00:30:26,044 --> 00:30:28,079
The draggety drama continues
right after this.

737
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,669
Judges gon' judge
and skaters gon' skate.

738
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,803
Here we go.

739
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:36,439
When I call your names,
please roll forward.

740
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:39,108
Naomi Smalls.

741
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:41,811
Kim Chi.

742
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:44,614
Naysha Lopez.

743
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:46,416
Chi Chi DeVayne.

744
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:49,452
Ladies, you are safe.

745
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:52,422
You may leave the stage.

746
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,758
And please don't
kill yourselves.

747
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,528
The rest of you represent
the high rollers

748
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:00,363
and the low rollers
of the week.

749
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:01,664
Feelin' lucky?

750
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:03,133
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

751
00:31:04,768 --> 00:31:07,036
Starting with Thorgy Thor.

752
00:31:07,037 --> 00:31:09,472
Your roller girl look--
You're giving me '70s.

753
00:31:09,473 --> 00:31:11,074
You had the big blonde 'fro.

754
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:13,810
Not the most wildly inventive.
Okay.

755
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,345
Now I'm gonna go
to your performance,

756
00:31:15,346 --> 00:31:18,348
which was so good.

757
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,515
Nailed it!

758
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:21,851
Your choreography was
meticulously done.

759
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:23,653
Yes!

760
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:25,556
I'm so proud of you.
Great job.

761
00:31:26,757 --> 00:31:28,658
Next up, Derrick Barry.

762
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:29,826
I like this whole, like,

763
00:31:29,827 --> 00:31:32,061
Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry
kind of thing.

764
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:33,329
You are doing a great job
with trying

765
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,498
to give us something
other than Britney.

766
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:36,499
But I feel like
you're coming out

767
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,101
and these clothes
are wearing you.

768
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,502
With your performance,

769
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:43,006
the personality of the character
didn't really connect.

770
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,407
It was too laid back.

771
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:47,610
I'd love to see you show me
that you do have soul,

772
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:49,412
so what you need
to get to work on

773
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,814
is giving us your soul.

774
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,917
At least she's "purty."

775
00:31:53,918 --> 00:31:55,785
Next up, Acid Betty.

776
00:31:55,786 --> 00:31:57,020
Your performance,

777
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:59,989
I felt like you gave me
the "Sybil" multiple personality

778
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,392
with a little bit
of Carol Burnett goin' on.

779
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:06,095
I think you were
very convincing as a schizo.

780
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:08,965
This look tonight,
it's getting kinda predictable.

781
00:32:08,966 --> 00:32:11,668
I'd love to see something
way different.

782
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:14,604
Another challenge, Michelle.
I fucking love challenges.

783
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:16,906
Be you but don't be you.
Give us less but more.

784
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:19,409
Mm-hmm, what he said.

785
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,178
All right, next up,
Bob The Drag Queen.

786
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:23,313
I love this look.

787
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:25,915
You did this Glamazon girl
from "Tron."

788
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:29,285
Tin Man, I have to say,
needs some lubricant.

789
00:32:29,286 --> 00:32:30,653
Halle-lube!

790
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:31,921
Now let's get
to the performance.

791
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,590
<i>Everything about it
was on point.</i>

792
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:35,358
<i>That ad libs were
really, really good.</i>

793
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,294
Taraji is going to die.

794
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:41,898
Lee Daniels is going to die.

795
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:43,766
Shantay, you slay.

796
00:32:43,767 --> 00:32:46,002
Cynthia Lee Fontaine.

797
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:47,470
Cynthia.

798
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:49,906
You have a great body with
a shirt that's like a formal

799
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:51,908
with a formal necklace
and formal earrings,

800
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:55,044
then you have, like, Hooters
shorts that don't fit at all.

801
00:32:55,045 --> 00:32:57,814
It's so discombobulated.

802
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:00,483
The "Empire" scene, I don't
know what you were saying,

803
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:02,318
but I didn't care.

804
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,787
There were some nuances
that were missed.

805
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:07,790
What did you think,
watching yourself in the scene?

806
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:08,992
I love it.

807
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:10,894
It was really good.

808
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:11,995
It was really good.

809
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:15,431
Aw, she's like a puppy.
Can we keep her?

810
00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:19,302
Thank you very much.

811
00:33:19,303 --> 00:33:21,404
All right, next,
Robbie "Turnter."

812
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:22,805
I do love the jumpsuit.

813
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:24,841
But what's bothering me
is all the silver accoutrements

814
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,409
and then a gold necklace.

815
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,911
I would lose the necklace.

816
00:33:27,912 --> 00:33:29,879
Um, when we were workin'
on that scene,

817
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,314
Ru was directing you

818
00:33:31,315 --> 00:33:33,750
to kinda get into
the two different voices.

819
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:35,285
I don't think
you stuck with that.

820
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:36,753
It was kinda like
I didn't have a moment

821
00:33:36,754 --> 00:33:39,255
to, like, break
and think of your notes

822
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:41,391
before we moved on
to another note

823
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:44,761
and also remember where
the blocking for the camera was

824
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:46,763
because I can't see
very far.

825
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:49,866
When we originally read it,
I was Vanilla Wafer.

826
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:51,868
And it--we did change it.

827
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,236
Did that hurt you,
you think?

828
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:55,138
I think it did hurt me,
and I didn't speak up

829
00:33:55,139 --> 00:33:56,506
even though I was
feeling it,

830
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:58,374
and so for the betterment
of the team, I was like--

831
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:01,010
You can't allow yourself
to be a victim

832
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:03,246
and use the excuse
of, "I was being nice."

833
00:34:03,247 --> 00:34:04,414
It's a competition.

834
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:06,783
Whoo!
Break it down, Tasha.

835
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:08,151
I think we've heard enough.

836
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:10,253
While you untuck
backstage,

837
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:12,322
the judges and I
will deliberate.

838
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,892
All right, now just
between us squirrel friends,

839
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:16,993
what do you think?

840
00:34:16,994 --> 00:34:18,695
<i>Thorgy Thor.</i>

841
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:21,631
Her Chocolate Chip Cookie
killed it.

842
00:34:21,632 --> 00:34:23,900
It's safe to say that,
uh, her Chocolate Chip Cookie

843
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,368
was baked in a lovin' oven.

844
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:27,036
Mmm, cozy.

845
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,037
It brings all the boys
to the yard.

846
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:29,038
Yeah!

847
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,974
That's a milkshake.
Oh.

848
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:32,208
Keep up, whitey.

849
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:33,409
<i>Derrick Barry.</i>

850
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,311
She goes from Britney Spears
to Katy Perry.

851
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:38,047
I'm still waiting
to find Derrick Barry.

852
00:34:38,048 --> 00:34:40,149
I thought the runway
was really cute.

853
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,286
But in the scene,
Ginger Snap got lost to me.

854
00:34:43,287 --> 00:34:45,488
I've seen her perform
as Britney Spears.

855
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,624
She puts her whole self into it,

856
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,059
and that's what she
needed to do in this challenge.

857
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,261
<i>Acid Betty.</i>

858
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:53,396
I think she did look
like a roller warrior,

859
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:55,465
<i>but I could probably
do without the Mohawk.</i>

860
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,066
In this role,
she looks like

861
00:34:57,067 --> 00:34:59,502
she's one french fry short
of a Happy Meal straight away.

862
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:01,804
And that's a good thing,
right?

863
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:04,440
It's not easy to improv,

864
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,843
but also stay focused
on the scene.

865
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:08,611
I am feelin' her swag.

866
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:12,515
She has charisma and it allows
her to sell absolutely anything.

867
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,784
This Tron jumpsuit
is so basic,

868
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:17,587
and I found myself goin',
"Oh, my God, I love it so much."

869
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:19,589
Her Tron was on.

870
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,324
<i>Cynthia Lee Fontaine.</i>

871
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:24,360
Bless her cotton socks
with that runway outfit.

872
00:35:24,361 --> 00:35:27,096
Oh! Oh!
They were Fruit of the Loom.

873
00:35:27,097 --> 00:35:30,466
I just felt like she didn't
commit to the role that she had,

874
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,235
as sweet as she is,

875
00:35:32,236 --> 00:35:34,070
but what's sweet
got to do with it?

876
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:35,238
All right, Ike Turner.
Okay?

877
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,307
Oh, no, she just did not.

878
00:35:37,308 --> 00:35:39,842
You had given
a lot of direction,

879
00:35:39,843 --> 00:35:42,445
but Robbie
did not really get it.

880
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:44,480
But I love that jumpsuit.

881
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:46,149
I would wear the hell
out of that jumpsuit.

882
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,217
I love it.

883
00:35:47,218 --> 00:35:50,620
Silence!
I've made my decision.

884
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:53,256
Bring back my roller girls.

885
00:35:53,257 --> 00:35:55,226
"Wheels" be right back.

886
00:35:57,535 --> 00:35:59,035
Who's skating to victory?
Who's on thin ice? Let's watch.

887
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:00,336
Welcome back, ladies.

888
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:01,604
I've made some decisions.

889
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,008
Thorgy Thor.

890
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:06,209
You're safe.

891
00:36:07,845 --> 00:36:10,213
Bob The Drag Queen.

892
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,748
Condragulations,
you're the winner

893
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,116
of this week's challenge.

894
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:15,251
Yes, honey,
she is one smart cookie.

895
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:16,586
Get it?

896
00:36:16,587 --> 00:36:20,323
<i>You've one $3,500
of innovative eyewear</i>

897
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:21,958
<i>from Bradley Kenneth.</i>

898
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,059
Wow!

899
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,294
Ah!

900
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,329
<i>Now all the other girls
can see what I can do.</i>

901
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:28,598
I feel like everyone knows
I'm a girl to beat.

902
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,400
And avoid
when she's on wheels.

903
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,268
Acid Betty.

904
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:34,771
You're safe.
Thank you, Mama.

905
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:36,439
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,

906
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,642
your Ginger Snap was <i>loca,</i>

907
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:43,112
but the judges were not crazy
about your roller girl.

908
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:47,951
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

909
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:50,153
Aw, chica.

910
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:51,521
Robbie Turner,

911
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:55,024
your Macaroon
was not coconut-y enough.

912
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:58,027
Derrick Barry,

913
00:36:58,028 --> 00:37:02,265
your Ginger Snap
did not snap, crackle, or pop.

914
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:03,833
Girl.

915
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:09,873
Robbie Turner,
I'm sorry, my dear,

916
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,641
but you are
up for elimination.

917
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:13,409
Ooh! Dang it!

918
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,846
Derrick Barry,
you are safe, but...

919
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:17,847
you better work, bitch.

920
00:37:17,848 --> 00:37:20,049
You want a Maserati?

921
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,652
Cynthia Lee,
Robbie,

922
00:37:22,653 --> 00:37:24,420
now it's your choice.

923
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:28,591
Do you want to lip sync
in heels or wheels?

924
00:37:28,592 --> 00:37:29,592
Heels.

925
00:37:29,593 --> 00:37:30,593
Wheels.

926
00:37:30,594 --> 00:37:32,996
Grilled cheeses.
Take the wheels.

927
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:35,965
Two queens stand before me.

928
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:37,400
Prior to tonight,

929
00:37:37,401 --> 00:37:40,503
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

930
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:43,673
of "Mesmerized"
by Faith Evans.

931
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:47,443
Ladies,
this is your last chance

932
00:37:47,444 --> 00:37:51,080
to impress me
and save yourself

933
00:37:51,081 --> 00:37:53,016
from elimination.

934
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,086
The time has come...

935
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:59,689
For you to lip sync...

936
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,225
for your life.

937
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:05,862
<i>I deserve to be here.</i>

938
00:38:05,863 --> 00:38:07,931
I'm not going.

939
00:38:07,932 --> 00:38:09,899
Good luck

940
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,868
and don't fuck it up.

941
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:16,105
<i>You ever heard
about that thing?</i>

942
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:21,945
<i>I mean that real thing?</i>

943
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,747
<i>You don't know</i>

944
00:38:24,748 --> 00:38:26,916
<i>What you do to me,
do to me</i>

945
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:28,651
<i>Let me tell you</i>

946
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:30,653
<i>How ya make me feel</i>

947
00:38:30,654 --> 00:38:33,790
<i>My heart is on fire since
you put that thang on me</i>

948
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,991
<i>Oh-oh</i>

949
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:37,393
<i>You put that thang on me,
baby</i>

950
00:38:37,394 --> 00:38:38,862
<i>I'm the star right now.</i>

951
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:42,432
<i>Everybody is mesmerized
about my cuckoo and my dance.</i>

952
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,134
Koo koo kachoo.

953
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,402
<i>Baby, I'm spellbound</i>

954
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:47,871
<i>I'm floating on cloud nine</i>

955
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,772
<i>I can't even sleep</i>

956
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:51,708
<i>Boy, you got me weak</i>

957
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:53,143
<i>My heart is on fire</i>

958
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:55,278
See, now, that's why
we can't have nice things.

959
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,446
<i>Am I the first girl
that's ever</i>

960
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,647
<i>broken a light
on the runway?</i>

961
00:38:57,648 --> 00:38:59,782
I'm gonna say yes.

962
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,657
<i>You don't know</i>

963
00:39:07,658 --> 00:39:09,893
<i>What you do to me,
do to me</i>

964
00:39:09,894 --> 00:39:11,961
<i>Let me tell you</i>

965
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:14,931
Cynthia's serving us,
but Robbie's on wheels!

966
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:17,500
Ah!
I don't know!

967
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:21,104
<i>My heart is on fire since
you put that thang on me</i>

968
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,372
<i>Oh-oh</i>

969
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:28,077
Yeah!
Whoo!

970
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:30,047
Yes, bitch, work.

971
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:35,018
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

972
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:42,692
Robbie Turner...

973
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:44,761
shantay, you stay.

974
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:49,399
Thank you.
Thank you.

975
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,501
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,

976
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:54,504
Puerto Rico, Austin,

977
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:58,675
Santee Alley,
and now the world.

978
00:39:58,676 --> 00:40:00,143
Keep spreading your cuckoo.

979
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:01,611
Words to live by.

980
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,980
Now, sashay away.

981
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:06,049
I love you.
Thank you.

982
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,450
Thank you.

983
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:10,086
Whoo!

984
00:40:10,087 --> 00:40:11,788
Thank you.
Love you.

985
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:13,490
See you soon, <i>mis amores!</i>

986
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:15,426
Ciao, muchacha.

987
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,862
<i>I feel sad,
but, at the same time,</i>

988
00:40:18,863 --> 00:40:20,263
<i>I don't have any regrets.</i>

989
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:22,165
<i>I would like
to encourage everybody,</i>

990
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,566
<i>don't stop believing.</i>

991
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:26,469
Even if you are the only one
that believes in yourself.

992
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:31,976
This is Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
#MisAmoresCuckoo.

993
00:40:33,777 --> 00:40:35,712
Condragulations,
my queens.

994
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:37,280
Why'd she take
her skirt off?

995
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:38,615
If you can't love yourself,

996
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,517
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

997
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:42,051
Can I get a Amen up here?

998
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:43,419
both: Amen!

999
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,388
All right,
now let the music play.

1000
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:46,890
<i>Dance for life</i>

1001
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:50,460
<i>Die tomorrow,
live tonight</i>

1002
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:51,461
<i>Die tomorrow</i>

1003
00:40:51,462 --> 00:40:53,530
Thanks for watching,
roller squirrels.

1004
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:57,400
Next week the tide is high,
'cause Blondie is here.

1005
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:58,903
Is the train still running?
