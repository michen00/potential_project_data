     - Thank you very much.

1676
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:49,848
       before we moved on

00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:50,715
     - Thank you very much.

00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:02,690
     - Thank you very much.

1688
00:34:02,693 --> 00:34:03,842
   - I think it did hurt me,    
     and I didn't speak up

1689
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:04,992
     - Thank you very much.
