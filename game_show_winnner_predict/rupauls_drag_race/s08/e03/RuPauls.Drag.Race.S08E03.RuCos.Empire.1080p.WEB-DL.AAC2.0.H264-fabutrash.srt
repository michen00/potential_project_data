       - She had cancer.        

427
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,412
       I was in college,        
     like, having a blast,      

428
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:07,813
 and, like, I would always call 
          and be like,          

429
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,948
      "How's everything?"       
      It was always fine.       

430

         But it wasn't.         

431
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:13,284
    And I finally got a call    
    from my dad being like,     

432
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:15,485
 "You know, you should probably 
       really come home."       

433

       she was not the--        

434
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,089
     She was not a person.      
             She...             

435
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:22,524
       She wasn't there.        

436
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:24,259
 I wish they were just a little 
    bit more honest with me,    

437
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,859
    'cause when I got home,     
       she died that day.       

438
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:29,062

439
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:31,798
      - She was a skeleton      
       in a hospital bed.       

440
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,600

441

    <i> that was taken from me.</i>    

442
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:39,338
  And I'm very angry about it,  

443
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,707
        but I don't know        
    where to put that anger.    

444
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:44,341
It comes out of love for my dad,
           he's like,           

445
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,477
  "I just don't want to, like,  
 interrupt your life and ruin-- 

446
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,944
   Like, I want better things   
           for you."            

447
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:49,079

        to protect me."

450
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:52,715
      I didn't get to say       
        good-bye to her.        

451
00:17:52,717 --> 00:17:54,216
        She didn't want         
  to make my dad and my sister  

452
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:58,353
     feel, like, terrible,

453
00:17:58,355 --> 00:18:02,023
  How come they didn't, like,   
     tell me to come home?      

454
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:07,260
 I will never forget that day.  

455
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,196
       I guess that's why       
  I talk about things so much.  

456
00:18:09,198 --> 00:18:11,865
- Just get it over with.        
That's a great idea.

00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:11,958
          What, what?           

738
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,160
         Rucious is...          

739
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:19,331
   severely deadly illnesses    
        is...contagious?        

740
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,633
         [all screams]          

741
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,535
- Oh!                           

742
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:25,869
     - Is because I'm gay?      

743
00:29:25,871 --> 00:29:26,937
           Isn't it?            

744
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:30,740
            - Peace.            

745
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:36,277
                         - Oh...

746
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:41,115
   I guess whatever Rucious had,
        it really was sickening.

747
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:42,816
            [laughs]            

748
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:47,287
     Or maybe it was a lil'     
    extra somethin-somethin     

749
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,723
    I put in the cocktails.     

750
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:51,557
        [maniacal laugh]        

751
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,824
    Oh, you thirsty, bitch?     

752
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:53,925
            [laughs]            

753
00:29:53,927 --> 00:29:55,426
             Whoo!              

754
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:57,427
  I'ma take this motherfucker.  
     Gimme the shoe, bitch.     

755
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:59,562
            [laughs]            

756
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,531
              Oh!               
    Look at all this money.     

757
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,966
          He ain't got          
    no motherfucking backup.    

758
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,368
  Is the train still runnin'?   

759
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,037
           [laughter]           

760
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,173
     [cheers and applause]      

761
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:12,573
             - Wow.             

762
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:14,108
    Well, there you have it,    
            ladies.             

763
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,242
And all based on actual events. 

764
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:18,177
           - [laughs]           

765
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:20,846
      - Ladies, this week       
      you acted in teams.       

766
00:30:20,848 --> 00:30:24,784
          but tonight,          
 you'll be judged individually. 

767
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,420
         <i> Coming up...</i>          

768
00:30:28,422 --> 00:30:30,022
  - I don't know what you were  
   saying, but I didn't care.   

769
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:33,124
    - I think you were very     
    convincing as a schizo.     

770
00:30:33,126 --> 00:30:36,794
- Show me that you do have soul.

771
00:30:36,796 --> 00:30:38,096
          <i> - [laughs]</i>

00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,866
          <i> - [laughs]</i>           

773
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,402
           - Ladies,            
    when I call your names,     

774
00:30:45,404 --> 00:30:48,338
      please roll forward.      

775
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,307
         Naomi Smalls.

779
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:01,349
     Ladies, you are safe.      

780
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:02,951
    You may leave the stage.

782
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:09,089
        The rest of you         
   represent the high rollers   

783
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:11,491
      and the low rollers       
          of the week.          

784
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,693
         Now it's time          
   for the judges' critiques.   

785
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:17,595
   Starting with Thorgy Thor.   

786
00:31:17,597 --> 00:31:20,030
   - Your roller girl look--    
     You're giving me '70s.     

787
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:21,631
  You had the big blonde 'fro.  

788
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:24,367
 Not the most wildly inventive. 
            - Okay.             

789
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:25,902
- Now I'm gonna go              
to your performance,            

790
00:31:25,904 --> 00:31:28,971
which was so good.              

791
00:31:28,973 --> 00:31:32,408
Your delivery, your choreography
     was meticulously done.     

792
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,210
             - Yes!             
            [laughs]            

793
00:31:34,212 --> 00:31:37,312
     - I'm so proud of you.     
           Great job.           

794
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:39,213
   - Next up, Derrick Barry.    

795
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:40,514
   - I like this whole, like,   

796
00:31:40,516 --> 00:31:42,615
  Jeremy Scott for Katy Perry   
         kind of thing.         

797
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:43,949
  - You are doing a great job   
          with trying           

798
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:45,884
      to give us something      
      other than Brittney.      

799
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:46,984
        But I feel like         
       you're coming out        

800
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,652
       and these clothes        
        are wearing you.        

801
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:50,186
    - With your performance,    

802
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:53,555
the personality of the character
     didn't really connect.     

803
00:31:53,557 --> 00:31:55,090
     It was too laid back.      

804
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:58,160
 - I'd love to see you show me  
     that you do have soul.     

805
00:31:58,162 --> 00:32:01,162
So what you need to get to work 
   on is giving us your soul.   

806
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,063
           [chuckles]           

807
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:04,431
     - Thank you very much.     

808
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,232
      Next up, Acid Betty.      

809
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,633
      - Your performance,       

810
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,535
    I felt like you gave me     
the "Sybil" multiple personality

811
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,936
       with a little bit        
   of Carol Burnett goin' on.   

812
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:16,639
    - I think you were very     
    convincing as a schizo.     

813
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:19,509
      - This look tonight,      
it's getting kinda predictable. 

814
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:22,212
   I'd love to see something    
         way different.         

815
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:25,148
 - Another challenge, Michelle. 
  - I fucking love challenges.  

816
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,650
      - Be you but don't be you.
          Give us less but more.

817
00:32:27,652 --> 00:32:29,952
           [laughter]           

818
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:32,720
     - All right, next up,      
      Bob The Drag Queen.       

819
00:32:32,722 --> 00:32:33,954
      - I love this look.       

820
00:32:33,956 --> 00:32:36,456
   You did this Glamazon girl   
          from "Tron."          

821
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:39,825
   - Tin Man, I have to say,    
     needs some lubricant.      

822
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,026
           - [laughs]           

823
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,460
        - Now let's get         
      to the performance.       

824
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,127
      <i> Everything about it</i>      
         <i> was on point.</i>         

825
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,895
       <i> That adlibs were</i>        
     <i> really, really good.</i>      

826
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,831
   - Taraji is going to die.    

827
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:53,136
  Lee Daniels is going to die.  

828
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,639
           - Next up,           
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine.      

829
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,240
           - Cynthia.           

830
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,542
   You have a great body with   
  a shirt that's like a formal  

831
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,543
     with a formal necklace     
      and formal earrings,      

832
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:05,679
  then you have, like, Hooters  
 shorts that don't fit at all.  

833
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:08,448
    It's so discombobulated.    

834
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,117
 - The "Empire" scene, I don't  
   know what you were saying,   

835
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,952
       but I didn't care.       

836
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:15,421
   - There were some nuances    
       that were missed.        

837
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:18,357
      What did you think,       
watching yourself in the scene? 

838
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,624
          - I love it.          

839
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:21,525
           - [laughs]           
     - It was really good.      

840
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:23,293
      It was really good.       

841
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:26,230
           [laughter]           

842
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,799
     - Thank you very much.     

843
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,034
        All right, next,        
         Robbie Turner.         

844
00:33:32,036 --> 00:33:33,501
   - I do love the jumpsuit.    

845
00:33:33,503 --> 00:33:35,469
    But what's bothering me     
is all the silver accoutrements 

846
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,037
   and then a gold necklace.    

847
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,572
   I would lose the necklace.   

848
00:33:38,574 --> 00:33:40,507
   - Um, when we were workin'   
         on that scene,         

849
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:41,941
      Ru was directing you      

850
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:44,343
       to kinda get into        
   the two different voices.    

851
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:45,911
         I don't think          
      you stuck with that.      

852
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:47,946
     - It was kinda like I      
 didn't have a moment to, like, 

853
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:49,880
             break              
    and think of your notes     

854
00:33:49,882 --> 00:33:51,916
       before we moved on       
        to another note         

855
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:55,119
    and also remember where     
the blocking for the camera was 

856
00:33:55,121 --> 00:33:57,354
 because I can't see very far.  

857
00:33:57,356 --> 00:34:00,489
  When we originally read it,   
      I was Vanilla Wafer.      

858
00:34:00,491 --> 00:34:02,491
       And it--we did change it.

859
00:34:02,493 --> 00:34:03,958
- Did that hurt you, you think? 

860
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,760
   - I think it did hurt me,    
     and I didn't speak up      

861
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:07,227
 even though I was feeling it,  

862
00:34:07,229 --> 00:34:08,995
       and so for the betterment
       of the team, I was like--

863
00:34:08,997 --> 00:34:11,631
   - You can't allow yourself   
         to be a victim         

864
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,866
     and use the excuse of,     
      "I was being nice."       

865
00:34:13,868 --> 00:34:16,168
It's a competition.             

866
