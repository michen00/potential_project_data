00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,268
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"RuPaul's Drag Race"...</i>

2
00:00:02,269 --> 00:00:03,269
Oh, hi there.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,537
Double elimination

4
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:08,541
left a void that
I've decided to fill with...

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,011
Bitches, I'm back!
Yeah!

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,080
Naysha Lopez.

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,915
For this week's maxi challenge,

8
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:18,718
you'll be acting
in "RuCo's Empire."

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,419
Whoo!
Cue the drama!

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,754
both: Action.

11
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,691
Thi...

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,761
Iss.

13
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:33,065
I'm a strong
gay woman!

14
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,433
Okay.

15
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,703
Please, sir, empty your--

16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,906
Please, ma'am, will you empty
your pocketbook?

17
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:40,907
Gah!

18
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,375
Uh-oh.

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,476
I feel like you're coming out
and these clothes

20
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,977
are wearing you.

21
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:48,514
I'd love to see you show me
that you do have soul.

22
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,550
Bob The Drag Queen,
condragulations,

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,318
you're the winner
of this week's challenge.

24
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,387
Oh, yes, she did.

25
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,455
Shantay, you stay.

26
00:00:56,456 --> 00:01:00,359
Cynthia Lee Fontaine,
sashay away.

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,695
Adios, Cucu!

28
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:07,571
<i>#</i> #

29
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:09,006
Whoo!
Uh-uh!

30
00:01:09,007 --> 00:01:12,276
Aw.
Cucu.

31
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,611
<i>Cynthia just got eliminated.</i>

32
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:17,080
My continental Puerto
Rican sister's gone.

33
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:19,516
I'm really sad.

34
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:22,853
"Don't give up.
Love you."

35
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:24,254
Isn't the sweetest?

36
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,989
I can't wait to see her again.

37
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,224
You want her to come
back then?

38
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:29,493
Derrick,
let's not get crazy.

39
00:01:29,494 --> 00:01:31,228
Okay, she funny.

40
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:33,497
Cynthia is so loveable,
but girl,

41
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:35,499
that may have been
the worst outfit

42
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,468
in "Drag Race" history.

43
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,869
Alyssa, you're safe.

44
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,371
<i>And those</i>
<i>jogging shorts she had on?</i>

45
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:42,673
<i>Red stockings?</i>

46
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:44,308
<i>Going out looking like</i>
<i>Sofia Vergara's</i>

47
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,709
<i>less fortunate cousin,</i>

48
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,544
the one she don't
send money to.

49
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:48,812
I think it was legendary

50
00:01:48,813 --> 00:01:50,781
that you freaking did
a lip-synch

51
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:51,882
for your life with skates.
Well--

52
00:01:51,883 --> 00:01:53,717
Bitch, you killed that
shit.

53
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,387
Actually, I'm feeling shaken
in this competition right now,

54
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:00,257
and the thing
that I know I can do--

55
00:02:00,258 --> 00:02:02,426
acting,
I fail at?

56
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,995
I'm feeling
really disappointed in myself.

57
00:02:04,996 --> 00:02:06,396
I think I got good critiques,

58
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:07,731
like, we're seeing
something different,

59
00:02:07,732 --> 00:02:08,966
but then I got told
from Michelle

60
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,901
that I don't
really have a soul.

61
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:12,603
Michelle said
you don't have soul.

62
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:15,806
She didn't say
you don't have <i>a</i> soul.

63
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:17,407
Then I'll
just start twerking.

64
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:19,676
Come on,
barry bootie challenge.

65
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,179
Is that my soul?
Come on, barry bootie.

66
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,747
They don't want you to be--

67
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:25,916
Girl,
she ain't getting it.

68
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:27,384
Betty has soul.

69
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:29,553
This is Betty's character
that she created.

70
00:02:29,554 --> 00:02:31,221
What you don't realize is
Betty doesn't have a character.

71
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:32,756
This is just Betty.

72
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:35,092
Yeah, you really
need to find, like, who you are.

73
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:36,627
That's not Britney Spears.

74
00:02:36,628 --> 00:02:39,062
<i>I still don't get a sense</i>
<i>of who Derrick Barry is</i>

75
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:40,497
<i>as a drag queen,</i>

76
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:42,900
aside from the fact that
he does Britney impersonation.

77
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,668
<i>He needs to find ways to</i>

78
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,236
take his drag much further.

79
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:49,606
<i>That could be a big problem</i>
<i>for Derrick as we move forward,</i>

80
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:50,808
and we're moving forward,
honey.

81
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:52,042
The train's pulling out
of the station.

82
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:56,413
Oops, I did it again.

83
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,051
All aboard
for a brand-new episode

84
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:03,420
of "RuPaul's Drag Race:
Ruvealed."

85
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,155
Are you ready to rock out?

86
00:03:05,156 --> 00:03:07,024
With my cock out?
Uh-huh.

87
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:09,026
Tonight my girls form bands.

88
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:11,461
It's gonna get punky
yet funky.

89
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:12,863
Yes, god!

90
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:15,599
<i>Chris Stein and Debbie Harry.</i>

91
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,067
Legendary!

92
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:18,535
<i># May the best woman </i>

93
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:20,738
<i># Best woman win </i>

94
00:03:24,576 --> 00:03:26,944
Hey, everyone.

95
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,645
Walk into the room
purse first.

96
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:31,648
Purse first. Purse first.
Purse first.

97
00:03:31,649 --> 00:03:33,984
Ah, walk into
the room purse first. Clack!

98
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:36,186
She is determined
to make that happen.

99
00:03:36,187 --> 00:03:37,387
Commit, baby.

100
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:40,390
<i>She done</i>
<i>already done had herses.</i>

101
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,993
<i>Hey, rock lobsters.</i>
Hey!

102
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:46,129
<i>One way or another,</i>
<i>you've got to rock the Casbah,</i>

103
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,198
<i>and when the tide is high,</i>

104
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,567
<i>girl,</i>
<i>I know what boys like.</i>

105
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:52,971
<i>Boys like me.</i>

106
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:56,306
What?

107
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:59,643
Hello, hello, hello.

108
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:03,180
Now long before I became
supermodel of the world,

109
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:06,750
I was in a punk rock band
called Wee Wee Pole.

110
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,385
Honey, you can't make
this stuff up.

111
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:11,255
<i>I was inspired by bands</i>
<i>like the B-52s...</i>

112
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,357
Yeah!
Wendy O. Williams...

113
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:16,260
Whoo!
And my all-time favorite...

114
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:18,929
Blondie.
Yes!

115
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,198
Now for this week's
Maxi Challenge,

116
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,802
you're going to form
your own new wave band.

117
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:28,739
#NewWaveQueens.

118
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,807
Hey.

119
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,208
Okay, she is giving me
flashbacks.

120
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,744
Working in teams of three,
you'll be writing lyrics

121
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:35,879
to original retro tracks.

122
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,382
You need to create
a unique style

123
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:41,018
using clothes, shoes,
and accessories

124
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,388
provided by
Out of the Closet thrift stores.

125
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:47,391
And tomorrow, in front
of an audience of groupies,

126
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:49,593
you'll be performing live.

127
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:52,729
Yes, live,
as in living!

128
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,998
You all
form your own bands.

129
00:04:56,768 --> 00:04:59,403
Anarchy!

130
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:00,971
I love these bitches.

131
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:03,340
This is our team.
Team Best Friend Race.

132
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,042
You want to do New York?

133
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:07,444
Oh.
Yeah!

134
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:09,379
Team New York.

135
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,115
Aka the Big Adam's Apple.

136
00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:13,817
<i>The third team</i>
<i>just seems like</i>

137
00:05:13,818 --> 00:05:17,154
leftovers
just formed together.

138
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:19,823
Now there are three
different tracks:

139
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:21,992
punk, synth, and party.

140
00:05:21,993 --> 00:05:23,093
Party.

141
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:24,995
You guys
figure out who gets what.

142
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:29,199
And on the runway,
the category is neon realness.

143
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,070
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

144
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,772
and may the best woman rock!

145
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,377
All right,
let's make a case.

146
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:41,478
We want punk.

147
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,380
<i>Kim, Robbie,</i>
<i>and I choose punk</i>

148
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:44,982
because we don't want
to give the judges

149
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,116
something
they've seen before.

150
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,985
We want to
really rough it up.

151
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:49,419
We want party.
And we also want party.

152
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,720
We also want party.

153
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,190
Okay, let's everyone
in their group

154
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:54,658
individually say what you want.

155
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,527
I definitely,
definitely want party.

156
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,095
Party.
Party.

157
00:05:58,096 --> 00:05:59,129
Party. And what do you guys
want in your group.

158
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,165
Party.
I want party.

159
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:03,101
Synth.

160
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:06,703
'Cause it has soul,
it has rhythm.

161
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:08,339
See, and I felt like
that about this.

162
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:13,944
Now I will say this group
is unanimous on party,

163
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:14,978
and you guys
are not unanimous on party.

164
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,046
Oops!

165
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,481
Come on, head game.

166
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,616
There's, like,
this turmoil between

167
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:21,185
<i>Chi Chi and his group,</i>

168
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,554
so we kind of, like,
pit them against each other.

169
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:25,355
I just don't
want you guys to fight.

170
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:26,757
I don't want
Chi Chi to be upset.

171
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:28,158
I genuinely don't think
that your group

172
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,393
will be as strong
with this

173
00:06:29,394 --> 00:06:31,128
'cause you were like,
"I want synth."

174
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,497
You got to turn 'em
against themselves.

175
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,202
Just get some water.

176
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:39,937
Scheme queen,
scheme!

177
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:41,905
We're gonna go with synth,
and you guys go with party.

178
00:06:41,906 --> 00:06:44,408
All right.
Thank you so much.

179
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,844
<i>Derrick and I,</i>
<i>being team players,</i>

180
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:48,612
decide we're
gonna go with synth.

181
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:49,813
Let's make it work.

182
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:51,148
Girl, we are art.

183
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,516
That's fine.
You can be art.

184
00:06:52,517 --> 00:06:54,751
Art, art, art,
art, art.

185
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:56,487
Art, art,
shekat-kat-boom.

186
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:58,121
Oh,
shika-kat-kat-ki-kat.

187
00:06:58,122 --> 00:07:00,390
Okay, see now they just
showing off.

188
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:01,525
Mm, mm, mm.

189
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:02,759
I hope
that's not their song.

190
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,795
If that's their song,
that sucks.

191
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:07,965
I got an idea.
What we do is...

192
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:10,000
we incorporate shapes.

193
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:13,070
I'm circle, you're triangle,

194
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:14,571
and you're square.
That's cool.

195
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:16,106
I'm an hourglass.

196
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,341
Oh, ow.

197
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:20,677
I think our costumes
should be that shape,

198
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:21,845
you know what I mean?

199
00:07:21,846 --> 00:07:25,349
Like, cardboard cut-out
geometric shapes.

200
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,750
Yeah, no.

201
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,752
We should just be,
like, this is our head,

202
00:07:28,753 --> 00:07:30,053
this is our hands.

203
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:34,358
<i>I'm not surprised Chi Chi</i>
<i>came up with this concept.</i>

204
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,360
This is, like,
a girl that shops at Michael's

205
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:38,262
for every outfit
that she owns.

206
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,197
Just thought
we'd come on stage dressed like

207
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,833
a square, a circle,
and a triangle.

208
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:45,235
To me, that would be
more visually appealing.

209
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:46,403
No.

210
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:48,105
Naysha's already gone
home once.

211
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:50,674
<i>Derrick just got clocked</i>
<i>by the judges,</i>

212
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,009
and I sure in hell

213
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,244
don't want Michelle
calling me basic again.

214
00:07:54,245 --> 00:07:56,246
We all need
to step our game up.

215
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:57,614
I don't want
to help you guys,

216
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:59,683
but the genre in which you guys
are doing of synth

217
00:07:59,684 --> 00:08:03,053
was all about
geometrical shapes, oddness.

218
00:08:03,054 --> 00:08:06,056
Klaus Nomi was, like--he was
a walking triangle.

219
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:08,058
But, I mean,
we can be fashionistas.

220
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:09,660
That's fine.

221
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:12,596
If you could show me something
that's not a cardboard box

222
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:14,798
on my body then
I want to see it.

223
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,567
I'm with Chi Chi.

224
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,602
Acid Betty, seriously?

225
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:20,671
Shut the fuck up.

226
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:22,339
And you're the oldest one

227
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,808
in the bunch,
you should know better.

228
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,577
Thanks, Betty.

229
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,745
<i>Coming up...</i>

230
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:31,448
Thorgy, is that not funny?
No.

231
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,552
Thorgy is driving me crazy.

232
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:37,955
Do you not see yourself
all over the song?

233
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:41,359
New York is in a bumpy state
of mind right after this.

234
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,269
Welcome back.
Who's ready to get punked?

235
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:47,805
We have to make it funny.

236
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:49,506
Right, absolutely.
Yeah.

237
00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:53,010
This week's Maxi Challenge
is to form new wave bands.

238
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:56,747
We have to write lyrics
and perform our track live.

239
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,081
What if we just
wrote something, like,

240
00:08:58,082 --> 00:08:59,583
just completely,
like off the cuff.

241
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,318
Like, I don't know,
chicken wings.

242
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,619
Uh-huh, tell it, girl.

243
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,588
It could be our thing.
That could be cute.

244
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,123
The other team,
like, I don't--

245
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:08,258
Kim Chi and Robbie
as punk?

246
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:10,994
<i>When I look at Kim Chi,</i>
<i>Robbie, and Naomi,</i>

247
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:13,630
I sure as hell
don't see no punk.

248
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:15,566
And then chicken wing.

249
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:19,403
Maybe our song is, like,
something hot and spicy.

250
00:09:19,404 --> 00:09:20,938
Louisiana's finest.

251
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:22,706
Barbeque.

252
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,374
You're a punk group,
and you're gonna scream

253
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,743
about chicken wings
and dipping sauces?

254
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:30,147
Let's go chicken wings.

255
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,915
Nothing about this
is finger-licking good.

256
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,650
That group is gonna lose.

257
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:37,421
Like a Stepford Wife,
your fantasy.

258
00:09:37,422 --> 00:09:40,591
Or why don't you say,
"I'm <i>not</i> a Stepford Wife."

259
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:41,892
Oh, that's good.

260
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm, like,
really excited about this.

261
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,429
Well, Chi Chi
will help us soul this up too.

262
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,264
Yeah.

263
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,933
<i>I feel like Chi Chi doesn't</i>
<i>really want to be in our group.</i>

264
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,102
His energy is really off.

265
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:53,637
I know
y'all want to work together,

266
00:09:53,638 --> 00:09:56,406
but I have, like,
no look for neon couture,

267
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:59,376
so could I, like, go over
and cutout something real quick?

268
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:01,379
Oh, Lord.

269
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:10,787
Well, that sucks.

270
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:14,424
 You could be square, now,
just don't be a nun 

271
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:16,793
Chi Chi,
how did that sound?

272
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:18,629
Chi Chi, were you
listening, or no?

273
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,931
It was good.
Yeah, I think that's cool.

274
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,633
And if he doesn't like it,
he can change it.

275
00:10:22,634 --> 00:10:25,669
<i>Girl,</i>
<i>it's a group challenge.</i>

276
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,437
Engage...

277
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:30,108
<i>because that's what you do</i>
<i>when you're on a team.</i>

278
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,777
Where did Chi Chi go?

279
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:35,012
Queen gone rogue.

280
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,313
Oh.
Wait.

281
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:39,316
So I'm working
on my runway outfit

282
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:42,019
because these bitches
have fabulous costumes,

283
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,889
and I'm gonna walk
out in a neon bathing suit.

284
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,492
<i>So if it seems like</i>
<i>I'm a little worried, I am.</i>

285
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:49,660
<i>And that's why I'm quiet.</i>

286
00:10:49,661 --> 00:10:52,930
I'm distancing myself
from the girls,

287
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:54,198
but you know what?

288
00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:55,899
I'ma work this shit out.

289
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,469
<i>Peace.</i>
I believe her.

290
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:01,104
All right,
let's keep writing.

291
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,607
How about the first line
is what's that smell?

292
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:05,042
Hm, love it.

293
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:06,877
'Cause we're singing about
street meat.

294
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:08,378
You're right. You're right.
You're right. You're right.

295
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:09,446
You're right. You're right.
It's quicker.

296
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,814
You like to explain it.
Yeah.

297
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,617
When we go "yes,"
you don't have to convince us.

298
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:14,885
And we just laugh
because you're--you--

299
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:16,186
I just--
'Cause we go like this,

300
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,521
"Yeah," and you go,
"It's so much simple, and,

301
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:19,089
"you know, I thought about it,
and you go like this.

302
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,491
"And there's a four-count,

303
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:21,992
and a four-count are so much
better than a three-count."

304
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,027
Yeah. You're not
the most time-efficient.

305
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:25,529
I'm very detail-oriented
and neurotic.

306
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,998
My process is,
like, I sit there and examine

307
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:30,234
every little tiny thing,

308
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:32,669
tear it all apart,
and put it back together.

309
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,938
This is where the big
black beans could come in.

310
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:37,074
You see what I mean?
No.

311
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:38,942
Thorgy, is that not funny?
Come on, that is--

312
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:40,077
Uh, no,
I don't think it's funny.

313
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:42,679
What?

314
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,581
What sets me off
is this sound...

315
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,352
Ugh.
Ugh.

316
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:52,523
Oh, my God.

317
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,526
She's putting the "ugh"
in Thorgy.

318
00:11:55,527 --> 00:11:58,495
I have an ear for music,
rhythm, and, like, beats.

319
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,931
I'm a professionally trained
violinist, violist,

320
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:03,934
and cellist, so, like,
I have a very critical ear.

321
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:05,569
Don't argue with me.

322
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,104
I just wish you would trust me
when I say, like, a suggestion.

323
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:08,372
We do.
We do trust you.

324
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,374
Do you not see yourself
all over the song?

325
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:11,809
All right,
now I know

326
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,677
that I can't even
speak without being attacked.

327
00:12:13,678 --> 00:12:14,945
She's feeling
very attacked.

328
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:19,016
Thorgy is driving me crazy.

329
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:22,186
She's not contributing
as much as she's negating.

330
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:24,855
I'm actually
holding back, like, 94%

331
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:27,157
of, like, what
I actually want to say.

332
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:30,260
Thorgy, I really
love this drape-y fabric on you.

333
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:31,728
Thank you so much.

334
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,598
Oh, and then the other group's
trying to sneak in

335
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,033
and break down our defenses.

336
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:38,402
Is it an actual cardigan?
Just a simple scarf.

337
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:40,137
Thorgy, you are
so easily distracted.

338
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,605
Oh, my God.

339
00:12:41,606 --> 00:12:44,541
And they're looking for
the easiest chink in our armor,

340
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,642
and it's Thorgy.

341
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:47,444
Thorgy...
Sabotuer!

342
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:49,346
Hi.
Hey.

343
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,081
They keep changing my lyrics.

344
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,649
My lyrics are so good,
and they're like,

345
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,351
"Let's change it to this,"
which is, like, idiotic--

346
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:56,186
Thorgy,
stop talking to them!

347
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:57,554
Jesus.

348
00:12:59,824 --> 00:13:02,059
<i>I'm just over it.</i>
<i>Whose team are you on?</i>

349
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,794
Like, are you working
with the chicken wings

350
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:04,995
or whatever their fucking
names are?

351
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:06,864
You guys are so fun.

352
00:13:06,865 --> 00:13:08,832
Like, that's hilarious.

353
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:11,668
Team New York is in
a small, little boat,

354
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,504
and it's got a hole,
and it's sinking.

355
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:14,938
I really think you're trying
to, like,

356
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:16,373
destroy the process almost.
I'm really not.

357
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:17,941
Now you're being
dramatic, Bob.

358
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:20,544
Yes! Thank you!
He's being so dramatic!

359
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:22,379
Bob?
Dramatic?

360
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,547
Never.

361
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:25,650
Those bitches
are going down.

362
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,052
<i>Coming up...</i>

363
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:30,554
Right now it's just
reading as, like, cheesy.

364
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:31,822
I just don't know
what you're saying.

365
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,023
You don't understand
what I'm saying?

366
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:34,591
No.

367
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:37,162
I think I may have just,
like, cost us this challenge.

368
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:39,764
We'll be right back.

369
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:42,568
Welcome back, Pop-Tarts.

370
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:45,204
It's time to get cookin'
in the studio.

371
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:48,440
Hi.
Hi, ladies.

372
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:50,743
Ru hooked us up
with a Lucian rehearsal

373
00:13:50,744 --> 00:13:53,112
for this challenge,
and my team is up first.

374
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:55,814
Let's go ahead and see
what you've put together so far.

375
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,683
There's a lot of pressure
on me for this challenge

376
00:13:57,684 --> 00:14:01,453
because the judges weren't crazy
about my performance last week,

377
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:04,123
and I feel like this character
is gonna show them

378
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:05,624
that I do have soul.

379
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,126
Here we go.
Cue music.

380
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:10,262
 We are the girls
of geometry 

381
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:14,533
I'm not a Stepford Wife,
I'm your fantasy 

382
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,769
Whoa.

383
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,204
Derrick.

384
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:22,041
Just stop.

385
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:23,242
That--that's good.

386
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:25,844
It might be fun for you guys

387
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,880
to maybe talk-sing some of it

388
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:31,517
because you're not, like,
incredible vocalists.

389
00:14:31,518 --> 00:14:33,986
Um, okay, let's try that.
Cue track.

390
00:14:33,987 --> 00:14:37,589
 We are the girls
of geometry 

391
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,859
 Shapes and sizes
is what we bring 

392
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,327
Stop.
Stop for a second.

393
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:43,729
You're still singing.
Oh.

394
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,763
And we were just talking about

395
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:45,831
talking instead.
Okay. Talk.

396
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:46,999
It's...

397
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,568
 We are the girls
of ge-om-et-ry 

398
00:14:49,569 --> 00:14:51,470
Yeah, more like a rap.

399
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:52,738
Y'all wanted some soul.

400
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,206
Don't get mad at her now.

401
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,642
I want to be
a pop star of drag,

402
00:14:56,643 --> 00:15:00,646
and I feel like now that
I'm given the singing challenge,

403
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:02,748
this is my time
to put everything out there.

404
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:08,053
 Really want me,
it's so plain to see 

405
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:10,823
Rectangle girls
of the world.

406
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:12,157
Yeah.
You're getting what I'm saying.

407
00:15:12,158 --> 00:15:13,592
Kind of catching on.
That's awesome.

408
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:16,028
It's my advice that you
two listen to Chi Chi.

409
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,831
She really gets what I'm saying
in terms of the arrangement.

410
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:19,998
I really appreciate that you,

411
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,034
like, already
in one take

412
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:23,602
did kind of what I was saying,

413
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:24,770
so...it's really cool.

414
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:27,040
Mm, they didn't
see that coming.

415
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,177
Hey, bone collectors,

416
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,445
we're Les Chicken Wings,

417
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,914
and we've got a bone
to pick with you.

418
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,383
Think you're hot,
but you're not 

419
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:39,485
 Think you're turned,
you're just burnt 

420
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:40,452
<i></i> 

421
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:41,954
Okay, they cute.
Right?

422
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:43,088
The biggest thing

423
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,391
is to figure out
that punk attitude.

424
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:47,059
Yeah.
So when you perform this,

425
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,927
it's gonna have to be
times ten

426
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,329
of what you're doing right now.
Right.

427
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,931
So I want to hear
a little anger.

428
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,066
I'm gonna have
each of you give me,

429
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:58,370
like,
a loud, primal scream.

430
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,472
Oh, boy.
Naomi, you first.

431
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:03,208
Okay.

432
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:05,044
You're smiling.
You're so happy.

433
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:06,879
Come on, anger.
Kim Chi?

434
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,648
Robbie?

435
00:16:12,252 --> 00:16:14,053
Somebody just
snatched your wig,

436
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:15,087
tripped you,

437
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:16,321
and stole all your heels.

438
00:16:18,258 --> 00:16:20,492
Finally, advice
we can all understand.

439
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:22,428
Let it out.

440
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:25,597
<i>So we're trying</i>
<i>to be punk and angst-y,</i>

441
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,766
but it was not working,

442
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,401
<i>and I'm feeling the pressure.</i>

443
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:32,604
I have been on
the bottom of the game,

444
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:36,041
so I need this win
more than anybody else

445
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:37,109
in this competition.

446
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,610
Then you best
snatch it.

447
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,079
Punk it up, lady.

448
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,948
How are you feeling song-wise,
lyrics and everything?

449
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:44,751
I love it, anyway.

450
00:16:47,987 --> 00:16:50,622
It's good. It's good.
What's wrong?

451
00:16:50,623 --> 00:16:52,558
We love it.

452
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,226
So wait, you're not
all on the same page with it?

453
00:16:54,227 --> 00:16:55,661
We are on the same page.
We are. We are.

454
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:57,229
We are. We are. We are.
Thorgy just talks like that.

455
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,664
We are, but she's, like...
That's how she talks.

456
00:16:58,665 --> 00:17:00,065
Literally nit-picking.
But we have a final product

457
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,567
that we're all happy with.
We're good.

458
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:04,203
Churl, I'm just over it.

459
00:17:04,204 --> 00:17:05,604
I can't argue
with Thorgy anymore.

460
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:08,240
I think we got
a dream team here.

461
00:17:08,241 --> 00:17:09,241
Here we go.

462
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:10,943
Cue track.

463
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:13,145
What's that smell? 

464
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:15,581
 We got
something to sell 

465
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,583
all:
 It's called street meat 

466
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,985
 You can shop around
the prices can't be beat 

467
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:21,086
Ow!

468
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,121
The only thing I would say

469
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,756
is that it was very character-y

470
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,124
and almost theatrical

471
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,695
instead of cool,
'80s, new wave vibe.

472
00:17:29,696 --> 00:17:32,197
All right. Cue music.
 It's called street meat 

473
00:17:32,198 --> 00:17:33,332
Whoo!

474
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,300
 No need to yell

475
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,002
All right, all right.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

476
00:17:37,003 --> 00:17:38,604
So this is what
I'm talking about.

477
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:41,306
You're saying it exactly the way
you'd say it in a musical.

478
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:42,841
What's that smell?

479
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:46,211
That sort of doesn't have
the cool, B-52s' vibe.

480
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:47,579
Right now
it's just reading as,

481
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,948
like, cheesy,
and you're just like, "Ehh."

482
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,084
I think the B-52s
are kind of cheesy.

483
00:17:52,085 --> 00:17:56,021
The B-52s are just
one example of a party band.

484
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:58,757
I'm just trying to direct
you to be more cool

485
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,592
because that's
what this era was about.

486
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:02,327
That's how
they sound to me.

487
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:04,830
What do you mean by
"more cool"?

488
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,565
I don't get that feel
from our track.

489
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,667
Am I alone in this?
Really? No one?

490
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:10,302
<i>Girl, you got to listen.</i>

491
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,438
Open the ears,
close the mouth.

492
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,640
He's telling us to lay back,
stop be so,

493
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:17,776
"Hey, girl,
yeah, whoo, yeah!"

494
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,079
I just don't know what
you're saying, Lucian, baby.

495
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,613
Ooh, she feeling
some kind of way.

496
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:22,648
You don't understand
what I'm saying?

497
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:23,982
No.

498
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,684
It's just about creating
your own style.

499
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:28,420
Like,
even someone like Lorde.

500
00:18:28,421 --> 00:18:29,621
I hate her.

501
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:31,291
I can't with her.
Okay. Well--

502
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,295
I'm just telling you,
she has her style.

503
00:18:36,296 --> 00:18:37,796
When you think of Lorde,
I think of, like,

504
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,732
apathetic teenager.

505
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,433
Av--Ooh.

506
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:44,269
I'm just trying to help you.
I guess so I'll be Lorde.

507
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,404
It's very surprising

508
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:47,606
that any queen
would come for me

509
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:51,076
because I'm gonna
be judging these bitches.

510
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,144
What he said.

511
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:53,245
I'm not saying
to be Lorde.

512
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:54,713
I'm not saying
to be the B-52s,

513
00:18:54,714 --> 00:18:56,849
but it can be
some other sort of melody

514
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,384
that is your thing.
It's like,

515
00:18:58,385 --> 00:19:00,686
"You're not the B-52s,
but how would B-52s say it?"

516
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,621
Is what it sounds
like to me.

517
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:03,822
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

518
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:06,392
You are embarrassing us
in front of a judge.

519
00:19:06,393 --> 00:19:09,161
If we're in the bottom,
Bob is going home, not me.

520
00:19:09,162 --> 00:19:10,863
<i>I know I shouldn't</i>
<i>be arguing with Lucian.</i>

521
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:13,565
I know I shouldn't be,
but I'm already in argument-mode

522
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,669
because Thorgy has got me
at the very edge of the cliff.

523
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,837
<i>Lucian's just</i>
<i>an innocent bystander.</i>

524
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,807
I think I may have just,
like, cost us this challenge.

525
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,781
Drag is not
a cheap profession.

526
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:31,750
It's really not.

527
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,585
I know. You got to do
what you got to do to live.

528
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,154
Do you have enough
to, like, live off of?

529
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:37,489
We were always
fortunate kids,

530
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,425
but we didn't have
a lot of money growing up.

531
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,226
So when I got
out of high school,

532
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,896
I started getting
all these loans

533
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:45,064
and just started

534
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:46,732
trying to find money.
Yeah.

535
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,101
And now I'm going
through a bankruptcy.

536
00:19:49,102 --> 00:19:50,936
The struggle is real.

537
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:53,172
Wow.
How much is your debt?

538
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,341
It's, like,
in the tens of thousands.

539
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,710
<i>I work two jobs washing cars</i>

540
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,812
<i>and checking</i>
<i>out people's groceries.</i>

541
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:03,382
Being broke is
a hurting feeling.

542
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:05,617
<i>People say they don't have</i>
<i>a dime to their name,</i>

543
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:08,387
but when you literally
don't have a dime,

544
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:11,557
you taking all your
shitty shit to the Coinstar

545
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,826
to, like--
just to get $5.00,

546
00:20:13,827 --> 00:20:17,963
like, I don't think
these girls understand that.

547
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,598
Not having the money
to buy fabric

548
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,601
and all that kind of stuff,
I just use what I got,

549
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:24,703
and that's where I find
myself saying, "Oh, I'm here

550
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,739
for the $100,000,"
you know what I mean?

551
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,940
Yeah.

552
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:28,907
When I want to be here
for the experience,

553
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,209
but in the back of my mind,

554
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:33,479
I just feel like
I need money,

555
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,581
and it's not all
about money all the time.

556
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,950
That's exactly why the stakes

557
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:40,085
in this competition
is so high to me.

558
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:42,521
It's not an option
for me to fail.

559
00:20:42,522 --> 00:20:44,523
Chi Chi does a lot
with very little.

560
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:45,824
I'm gonna put my hair up
and do my makeup,

561
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,559
like, immediately.
Yeah, I am too.

562
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,727
I'm always,
like, the last person

563
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:50,029
running around
with my head cut off.

564
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,631
And yet you still win.

565
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:54,700
Every time.
I've never won.

566
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,402
Frida Kahlo
got a special mention.

567
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:57,903
Yeah, a special mention...
That was winning.

568
00:20:57,904 --> 00:20:59,171
That I was good
at the dance challenge

569
00:20:59,172 --> 00:21:00,806
but didn't win,
but I was top,

570
00:21:00,807 --> 00:21:02,241
and then we did
the acting challenge,

571
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:03,409
and I was, like--they were like,
"You were really good,

572
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,543
but--"
Yup.

573
00:21:04,544 --> 00:21:05,711
I feel like
I'm the Susan Lucci.

574
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:06,979
Come on. Susan?

575
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,547
I'm the Susan Lucci
of the season.

576
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:10,649
<i>I nailed the "Empire"</i>
<i>acting Challenge,</i>

577
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,950
<i>and I was safe.</i>

578
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:13,919
<i>Bob wore literally</i>
<i>a $20 Halloween costume</i>

579
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,921
<i>that was falling apart,</i>
<i>and she won.</i>

580
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:18,457
<i>And, like, Bob is funny,</i>
<i>but so am I.</i>

581
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,459
I'm just not
as loud and annoying.

582
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,994
Girl, snap, hello.

583
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:23,896
You floored us.
We couldn't stop watching you.

584
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:26,565
Bob, you win."

585
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:27,666
It seems
like Bob and Thorgy

586
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:29,301
are in a competition
of their own,

587
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:30,669
and somebody's feelings

588
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,938
are inevitably
going to get hurt.

589
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:36,141
Welcome to "RuPaul's
Best Frenemies Race"?

590
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:38,177
all:
 We are street meats

591
00:21:38,178 --> 00:21:39,713
This is epic.

592
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,301
Welcome back
to Doll-a-palooza.

593
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:49,437
Wristbands.
Show me your wristbands.

594
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:54,642
This moment gags me
every time,

595
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:57,078
because we never know
what she's gonna give us.

596

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,158
<i>And, what?</i>

600
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,929
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

601
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,865
Michelle Visage,
are you ready to get punked?

602
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:19,901
I am indeed.

603
00:22:19,902 --> 00:22:23,137
And Lucian Piane,
did my girls rock your world?

604
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,639
They did, Ru.

605
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,142
And the co-founder
of Blondie, Chris Stein.

606
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:29,644
I hear you're a fan
of the show.

607
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:32,246
I watch everything
religiously.

608
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:35,316
And I must be dreaming.

609
00:22:35,317 --> 00:22:38,086
It's the legendary
Debbie Harry.

610
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:39,454
So happy to be here.

611
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:41,222
I'm always touched
by your presence, dear.

612
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:43,524
Seriously, bow down.

613
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,059
That is my goddess
right there.

614
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,694
Form new wave groups

615
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:48,830
and perform original songs

616
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:51,666
in front of a live audience.

617
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,835
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

618
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:56,237
and may the best woman win.

619
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:59,640
Welcome to She-BGB's.

620
00:22:59,641 --> 00:23:03,312
Hitting the stage,
it's Street Meatz.

621
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:10,685
 What's that smell? 

622
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:13,488
 We got something to sell

623
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,290
 It's called street meat 

624
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,626
 No need to yell

625
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:21,395

on vacation 

626
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:23,998

00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:52,673
Suck my bones dry,
nibble on my thigh 

696
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:53,941
 Said you liked the leg

697
00:26:53,942 --> 00:26:56,844
all:
 But that's all a lie 

698
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:01,282
 I was craving you
to be thick and meaty 

699
00:27:01,283 --> 00:27:04,318
 In the bedroom you said
 You're young and needy 

700
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,055
 Thought you were it,
but you're just really bad 

701
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:09,690
 Sad

702
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:11,726
 Mad

703
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:14,695
Yass!

704
00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:18,132
Buy our vinyl in the back!

705
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:23,204
<i>Coming up...</i>

706
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:24,539
This thing is mind-blowing.

707
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,776
What concerns me is
the attitude a little bit.

708
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:30,412
Clot.
Be right back.

709
00:27:32,168 --> 00:27:33,401
Welcome back.
Don't blink.

710
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,870
High-speed runway
starting right now.

711
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:40,108
Category is:
Neon Queen Realness.

712
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:42,477
Derrick Barry,
heart of glass,

713
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:44,779
ass of silicone.
She could swim in that.

714
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,047
Naysha Lopez.

715
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,183
Day-Glopez.

716
00:27:48,184 --> 00:27:49,951
Now you know.
Uh-huh.

717
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:53,021
Chi Chi DeVayne
from the Bayou Country.

718
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:56,024
Whip it good.
Uuh.

719
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,960
Kim Chi.
I love cabbage.

720
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:02,263
Yes. Me too.
Robbie Turner.

721
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:06,367
I don't know nothing
about birthing no babies.

722
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:07,769
Naomi Smalls.

723
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,205
Honey, she is serving
Billy Jean Queen.

724
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:12,474
Yum.
Acid Betty.

725
00:28:12,475 --> 00:28:14,442
Nosferatu goes to Fiorucci.

726
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,812
Bring back my gills.

727
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:20,415
Thorgy Thor,
thoroughly modern Thorgy.

728
00:28:20,416 --> 00:28:21,850
Yeah.
Absolutely.

729
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:23,384
Bob The Drag Queen,

730
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:26,754
not to be confused
with Bob the cable guy.

731
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:28,389
Bob, how's your head?

732
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,092
No complaints.

733
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:34,062
Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

734
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:39,467
Les Chicken Wings,
the crowd ate you up,

735
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:44,539
but one of you was
finger-licking great.

736
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,508
Robbie Turnter,
condragulations,

737
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:47,876
you are the winner
of this week's challenge.

738
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:49,377
Yes.

739
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:53,381
You'll receive a wig wardrobe
from Weaven Steven.

740
00:28:53,382 --> 00:28:55,016
This is, like,
so huge to me

741
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:57,952
that you're in the room,
Ms. Debbie Harry.

742
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,488
Like, I have a poster
that was above my bed,

743
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,925
and my parents really thought
I was straight for a minute.

744
00:29:03,926 --> 00:29:06,629
You mean I was a beard?

745
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,498
The three
of you may leave the stage.

746
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,634
Thank you,
Marie Aqua Net.

747
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:14,636
<i></i> 

748
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,237
Now it's time for
the judge's critiques.

749
00:29:16,238 --> 00:29:18,406
Come on,
rip 'em to shreds!

750
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:20,108
Bob The Drag Queen.

751
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:22,110
Hi, Bob.
Hi, Lucian.

752
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,545
Can I just say
before we get started,

753
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:25,580
yesterday,
I wasn't the kindest to you,

754
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:26,714
and that's not me,

755
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:28,850
and I apologize.
What was going on?

756
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,553
I wasn't really understanding
the references he was giving me.

757
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:33,788
Then I was like, "Well,
I don't even like that artist."

758
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:35,456
Who was the artist?
It was Lorde.

759
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,792
Oh, well, you're in luck.
She's our guest judge next week.

760
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:40,695
Whoo!

761
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,263
Well,
I accept your apology,

762
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,766
and, today,
I was impressed,

763
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:47,268
<i>especially with</i>
<i>the black beans line.</i>

764
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,037
I really highlighted
your character.

765
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,271
Great job.

766
00:29:50,272 --> 00:29:52,073
I think ratchet
drag is your thing,

767
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,008
but I am in love
with the way you look tonight.

768
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,510
Thank you.
It's in the step

769
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:57,812
in the fashion direction.
Less ratchet, more fashion.

770
00:29:57,813 --> 00:30:00,281
But you have to stay
professional at all times,

771
00:30:00,282 --> 00:30:02,116
no matter
how pissed off you are.

772
00:30:02,117 --> 00:30:03,251
Wisdom!

773
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:04,419
And I'm not
talking about teeth.

774
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,687
Hey there, Thorgy girl.

775
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,489
I'm not crazy
about this look tonight.

776
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,623
This is going on.
This is going on.

777
00:30:08,624 --> 00:30:10,058
This is going on.
This is--

778
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,893
There's just so much
that I'm losing you.

779
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,462
Sometimes a queen
<i>can</i> have on too much.

780
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:15,763
I ain't wrong.

781
00:30:16,866 --> 00:30:19,601
Next up, Acid Betty.

782
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:22,971
This thing is mind-blowing.
This is epic.

783
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,173
I mean, did you actually
make that wig yourself?

784
00:30:25,174 --> 00:30:27,675
I made everything you see
but the shoes, yeah.

785
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:29,144
Wow. Very good.

786
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:31,746
Style praise
from Debbie Harry?

787
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,814
 Epic

788
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:34,349
Than I did Acid Betty.

789
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,917
I didn't get
why everybody else kind of

790
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,453
went crazy new wave,
and you went '50s.

791
00:30:38,454 --> 00:30:40,655
It made me feel
that you weren't in your element

792
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:41,789
for the first time.
Oh, okay.

793
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,258
I totally felt like I was,

794
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,561
so that's weird
that you felt that way.

795
00:30:46,562 --> 00:30:49,230
Up next,
Hey, Derrick 

796
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:51,232
Your makeup
made me so happy.

797
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:54,536
I did not see a trace
of she-who-shall-not-be-named.

798
00:30:54,537 --> 00:30:55,804
Yes.

799
00:30:55,805 --> 00:30:57,372
Tonight on the runway,
do you look pretty?

800
00:30:57,373 --> 00:31:00,575
Yes, but I'm still waiting
for that breakthrough.

801
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:02,377
I'm hearing
Britney Spears a lot,

802
00:31:02,378 --> 00:31:03,745
but I--when I saw you
with the bangs

803
00:31:03,746 --> 00:31:05,013
I thought you could do Debbie.

804
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:07,081
Maybe you should audition
for the movie.

805
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:08,149
Oh.
Wow.

806
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,784
Call my agent.

807
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,452
Well,
you have a terrific voice.

808
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,121
Thank you.
But you were kind of,

809
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,123
like, disappointing
as a performer.

810
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,691
I don't know what's
happening in your head

811
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,660
because you're not
giving us 100%.

812
00:31:18,661 --> 00:31:19,861
Damn!

813
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:22,430
All right,
next up, Naysha Lopez.

814
00:31:22,431 --> 00:31:24,199
Hi, Ru.
Tell me about this outfit.

815
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,967
It feels like it's
painted on you.

816
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,169
Yeah.
It's actually all airbrushed.

817
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,305
And more to the point,
your ass is real?

818
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,573
Yes. It's real.

819
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:33,608
You got it from your Mama.
And my daddy.

820
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:36,511
Does your daddy deal
in medical-grade silicone?

821
00:31:39,215 --> 00:31:40,548
This is fun.

822
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:41,916
I think this is something
different for you.

823
00:31:43,085 --> 00:31:44,486
Now the outfit
in the group,

824
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,788
<i>it was like</i>
<i>part Dolly Parton,</i>

825
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:48,756
and then the circle
that wasn't really a circle.

826
00:31:48,757 --> 00:31:50,758
In terms of the outfit
in your group,

827
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:52,193
were you in charge of that?

828
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:53,661
It was a group challenge,

829
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,029
so we really participated

830
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,698
with everything
when it--you know--

831
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:59,067
Well, Chi Chi's
shaking her head.

832
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:01,136
You're saying it was not
a group effort?

833
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:03,138
No, the thing
Thorgy had on her head,

834
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:06,174
that's what I wanted
to wear as the actual costume.

835
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,375
I see.

836
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:08,610
I'm not gonna
be in a cardboard box.

837
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:09,878
Oh, okay.
Absolutely not.

838
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,479
Is this the first
you all are hearing

839
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,581
any dissention from Chi Chi?

840
00:32:13,582 --> 00:32:15,583
She was just disconnected.
I see.

841
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:16,885
You know, like, it was,
like, "Hey, Chi Chi,

842
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:18,386
"you want to come over here
really quick?

843
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:20,021
You know, we're gonna look
at some references,"

844
00:32:20,022 --> 00:32:22,824
and it's like,
"All right. Whatever."

845
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:23,825
Well, they was--

846
00:32:23,826 --> 00:32:25,026
I was told to
step my drag up,

847
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:26,961
and that's what
I wanted to do.

848
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:28,663
So tell me why you're
out here in a bathing suit

849
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,598
with no corset and a belt.

850
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:34,502
I don't have the expenses
to pay for something like this.

851
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:36,337
I'm in a bankruptcy.
I just don't have--

852
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:37,438
Hold on.

853
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:38,940
You don't need money,
girl.

854
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:40,942
That's never an excuse.

855
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:42,610
I know you can turn a show.

856
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:46,781
What concerns me
is the attitude a little bit.

857
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:48,650
I'm getting the feeling
that you have fought very hard

858
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:49,918
to be where you are.

859
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,220
I get it,
but we're lifting you up.

860
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,388
Let us.

861
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,056
Preach, Mama. Preach!
I hear you.

862
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,491
I'm sorry, y'all,
that, you know,

863
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:57,926
I just kind of
halfed it, and--

864
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,494
No, no, it's okay.
It's cool, sister.

865
00:32:59,495 --> 00:33:01,029
I don't want y'all
to feel like that, you know,

866
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,430
I tried to throw y'all
under the bus or anything, but--

867
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,899
What is this bus
everybody keeps talking about?

868
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,501
I think she means
the B-41,

869
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:09,003
down Flatbush Avenue.

870
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:12,240
Thank you, ladies.
While you un-tuck backstage,

871
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,576
the judges and I
will deliberate.

872
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,145
Aka let y'all have it,
but nice.

873
00:33:17,146 --> 00:33:18,379
Just between us Sunday girls,

874
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,647
what do you think?

875
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:22,383
Let's start with
Bob The Drag Queen.

876
00:33:22,384 --> 00:33:24,285
Bob was giving me
a little attitude,

877
00:33:24,286 --> 00:33:25,553
A little?

878
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:27,889
This is
a high-pressure competition.

879
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,390
Absolutely.

880
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:30,692
And I think personality things
that they may not even

881
00:33:30,693 --> 00:33:32,827
like in themselves
sometimes come out.

882
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:34,696
<i>And Bob did stand out.</i>

883
00:33:34,697 --> 00:33:36,664
Bob has a lot of charisma

884
00:33:36,665 --> 00:33:38,933
and seems to know who he is.

885
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,168
<i>Thorgy Thor.</i>

886
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:42,570
She delivered
on this challenge.

887
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:44,739
<i>There's just something</i>
<i>so quirky about her.</i>

888
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,741
I agree.
I was totally drawn to her.

889
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:48,476
Michelle, you had an issue
with her outfit.

890
00:33:48,477 --> 00:33:50,378
There was just so much
going on.

891
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:52,180
Did she paint sideburns on?

892
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:55,183
Down her cheekbones
and around her jawline,

893
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,684
<i>down her neck,</i>
<i>and down her arms.</i>

894
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:59,354
I think her challenge
in this competition

895
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:01,156
is to edit it down.

896
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:02,490
<i>Acid Betty.</i>

897
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,192
You know, I watch this show
all the time,

898
00:34:04,193 --> 00:34:06,361
and I was kind of waiting
for this "Wow" moment,

899
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,830
and that was Betty's runway.

900
00:34:08,831 --> 00:34:09,931
Lizard queen!

901
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,032
In the performance

902
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,834
just was not cohesive for me,

903
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:14,369
and because of it,

904
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,805
she was completely swallowed up
by those other two girls.

905
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:18,239
<i>Derrick Barry.</i>

906
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,808
<i>Most frustrating</i>
<i>thing, for me,</i>

907
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,811
is how temporary Derrick
is in performing.

908
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:25,246
And she's so not used
to performing something

909
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:26,648
other than Britney.

910
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,083
But she, you know,
really had an outstanding voice.

911
00:34:29,084 --> 00:34:31,186
But it's hard
to judge her as her,

912
00:34:31,187 --> 00:34:33,188
because Ru,
think about Chad Michaels.

913
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,422
Mm-hmm.

914
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:36,825
She can do tons
of other drag than Cher.

915
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:40,461
Derrick has to find a way
to break through that mold.

916
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:42,197
Let her break the ice.

917
00:34:42,198 --> 00:34:43,965
I kind of lost her
in the performance

918
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,233
<i>to the other two.</i>

919
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:46,768
Now, she was eliminated,

920
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:49,337
and we brought Naysha back.

921
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,339
She wants to be here so bad,
I can tell.

922
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,774
Uh-huh.
She's trying so hard,

923
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:55,577
but I don't know
if she is giving us enough.

924
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,011
<i>Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>

925
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,448
In the performance,
she was the standout for me.

926
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:03,718
She does have this mysterious
magnetic quality.

927
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,354
On the runway, however,
there's no excuse

928
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:09,123
<i>for you to come out here</i>
<i>being that basic.</i>

929
00:35:09,124 --> 00:35:10,358
No.

930
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,193
I watch this show
all the time,

931
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,462
and you cannot wear
the same shoes

932
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,531
for the challenge
and the runway.

933
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:19,601
Okay, I could not love
Chris Stein more.

934
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:22,070
That's amazing.

935
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:25,673
Silence.
I've made my decision.

936
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:29,110
Bring back my girls.

937
00:35:29,111 --> 00:35:30,778
Who's gonna
feel the rapture?

938
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,079
Keep watching.

939
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:35,168
The tide is high.
Who's moving on?

940
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,903
Let's watch.
Welcome back, ladies.

941
00:35:36,904 --> 00:35:39,772
Based on your
new wave performances

942
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:42,442
and your main stage
presentations,

943
00:35:42,443 --> 00:35:44,043
I've made some decisions.

944
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:50,850
Bob The Drag Queen,
you're safe.

945
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,652
Thank you.

946
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:56,356
Thorgy Thor,
you're safe.

947
00:35:56,357 --> 00:35:58,191
Thank you.

948
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:05,365
Acid Betty, your runway look
was a bright spot,

949
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:07,835
but in the challenge,
you were overshadowed.

950
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:12,338
You're safe.
Oh.

951
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:16,676
I'm Jewish, but I'm praying
to all the gods,

952
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:17,677
so thank you.

953
00:36:17,678 --> 00:36:19,345
Oy gevalt.

954
00:36:19,346 --> 00:36:22,182
Mishpocheh,
you may join the other girls.

955
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:25,118
<i></i> 

956
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,790
Derrick Barry, you didn't quite
ace your Dragometry test.

957
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:35,628
Naysha Lopez,
in neon, you are radioactive,

958
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:40,066
but your performance
was not electrifying.

959
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:44,070
Chi Chi DeVayne,
your runway ouch-fit

960
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:47,373
didn't dominate.

961
00:36:47,374 --> 00:36:49,175
Derrick Barry...

962
00:36:51,345 --> 00:36:52,545
You're safe.

963
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,214
I am gagging.

964
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:58,518
Thank you.
You may join the other girls.

965
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:08,361
Naysha and Chi Chi,
I'm sorry, my dears,

966
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:10,830
but you are both
up for elimination.

967
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:13,299
Whoo, child,
I did not see that coming.

968
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,367
Again?

969
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,869
<i>What the fuck?</i>

970
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,671
There's just no way
that I'm gonna go home again.

971
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:21,341
Two queens
stand before me.

972
00:37:21,342 --> 00:37:23,843
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

973
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:28,214
a lip-synch performance
of "Call Me" by Blondie.

974
00:37:28,215 --> 00:37:31,150
Ladies,
this is your last chance

975
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:33,920
to impress me
and save yourself

976
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:36,055
from elimination.

977
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:39,792
The time has come...

978
00:37:39,793 --> 00:37:42,061
for you to lip-sync

979
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:44,464
for...your...life.

980
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,334
<i>The only thing</i>
<i>that keeps going in my mind</i>

981
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:51,104
is, "Girl, hustle.
Make it work."

982
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:53,206
I'm gonna lip-sync
for my fucking life.

983
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:54,807
Good luck,

984
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:58,411
and don't fuck
it up.

1020
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,084
Thank you so much.

00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:47,687
You may join

00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:55,662
Naysha Lopez,
your beauty and your bootie

1023
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:58,565
did double-duty
this season.

1024
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:01,267
Now sashay away.

1025
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,571
Props to you, Mama.

1026
00:40:04,572 --> 00:40:07,540
Werk, Naysha.

1027
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:09,243
Bye.

1028
00:40:10,644 --> 00:40:13,580
<i>I was giving it 110%,</i>

1029
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:15,081
<i>and am I a little upset</i>

1030
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:17,283
<i>that someone</i>
<i>that's giving 50%</i>

1031
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:20,486
and not committed
at all is still here?

1032
00:40:20,487 --> 00:40:21,688
<i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>

1033
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,623
I want to tell the girls,

1034
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:25,491
"Stop your fucking
complaining.

1035
00:40:25,492 --> 00:40:27,193
<i>"Get your shit together,</i>

1036
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,761

<i>Ru has me on speed dial."</i>

1037
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,397
So you just never know.

1038
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:36,069
Condragulations,
ladies.

1039
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,038
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1040
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,040
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

1041
00:40:41,041 --> 00:40:43,443
Can I get a amen in here?
Amen.

1042
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:46,212
All right.
Now let the music play.

1043
