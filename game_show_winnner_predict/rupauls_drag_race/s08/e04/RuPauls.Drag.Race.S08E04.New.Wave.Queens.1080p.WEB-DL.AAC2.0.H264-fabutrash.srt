         a unique style

  pit them against each other.

            - Yeah.             

238
00:08:56,557 --> 00:09:00,058
  - This week's Maxi Challenge  
   is to form new wave bands.   

239
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,794
    We have to write lyrics     
  and perform our track live.   

240
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,128
       - What if we just        
     wrote something, like,     

241
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,630
        just completely,        
       like off the cuff.       

242
00:09:06,632 --> 00:09:09,599
      Like, I don't know,       
         chicken wings.         

243
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:11,634
 - Yeah, it could be our thing. 
     - That could be cute.      

244
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,169
       - The other team,        
        like, I don't--         

245
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,304
       Kim Chi and Robbie       
            as punk?            

246
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,040
   <i> - When I look at Kim Chi,</i>   
      <i> Robbie, and Naomi,</i>       

247
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:20,675
         I sure as hell         
       don't see no punk.       

248
00:09:20,677 --> 00:09:22,610
        - And then chicken wing.

249
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:26,446
    Maybe our song is, like,    
    something hot and spicy.    

250
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,981
     - Louisiana's finest.      

251
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,749
          - Barbeque.           

252
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:31,417
     - You're a punk group,     
    and you're gonna scream     

253
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,785
      about chicken wings       
      and dipping sauces?       

254
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:37,188
   - Let's go chicken wings.    
           - [laughs]           

255
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,956
      - Nothing about this      
    is finger-licking good.     

256
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,691
   That group is gonna lose.    

257
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:44,460
     Like a Stepford Wife,      
         your fantasy.          

258
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:47,630
- Or why don't you say,         
"I'm<i> not</i> a Stepford Wife."      

259
00:09:47,632 --> 00:09:48,931
       - Oh, that's good.       

260
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,298
          - I'm, like,          
   really excited about this.   

261
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,467
                 - Well, Chi Chi
  will help us soul this up too.

262
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:54,302
- Yeah.                         

263
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:56,971
 <i> - I feel like Chi Chi doesn't</i> 
<i> really want to be in our group.</i>

264
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:59,140
   His energy is really off.    

265
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:00,674
            - I know            
  y'all want to work together,  

266
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,443
       but I have, like,        
   no look for neon couture,    

267
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:06,412
   so could I, like, go over    
and cutout something real quick?

268
00:10:06,414 --> 00:10:08,347
          - Oh, Lord.           

269
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:17,822
- Well, that sucks.             
[sighs]                         

270
00:10:17,824 --> 00:10:21,458
   -  You could be square, now,
           just don't be a nun 

271
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,827
                        Chi Chi,
             how did that sound?

272
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:25,661
               Chi Chi, were you
               listening, or no?

273
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,962
         - It was good.         
  - Yeah, I think that's cool.  

274
00:10:27,964 --> 00:10:29,664
And if he doesn't like it,      
he can change it.               

275
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,699
            <i> - Girl,</i>            
    <i> it's a group challenge.</i>    

276
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,467
           Engage...            

277
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:37,136
  <i> because that's what you do</i>   
    <i> when you're on a team.</i>     

278
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,805
- Where did Chi Chi go?         

279
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,344
        - So I'm working        
      on my runway outfit       

280
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:49,046
     because these bitches      
    have fabulous costumes,     

281
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:52,916
       and I'm gonna walk       
  out in a neon bathing suit.   

282
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,519
      <i> So if it seems like</i>      
  <i> I'm a little worried, I am.</i>  

283
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,686
   <i> And that's why I'm quiet.</i>   

284
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:59,955
     I'm distancing myself      
        from the girls,         

285
00:10:59,957 --> 00:11:01,222
       but you know what?       

286
00:11:01,224 --> 00:11:02,924
    I'ma work this shit out.    

287
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:04,526
            <i> Peace.</i>             

288
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:08,128
                    - All right,
             let's keep writing.

289
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,630
        How about the first line
           is what's that smell?

290
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:12,064
- Hm, love it.                  

291
00:11:12,066 --> 00:11:13,898
  - 'Cause we're singing about  
          street meat.          

292
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,366
   - You're right. You're right.
     You're right. You're right.

293
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:16,467
  You're right. You're right.   
        - It's quicker.         

294
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:17,835
   - You like to explain it.    
            - Yeah.             

295
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:20,637
- When we go "yes,"             
you don't have to convince us.  

296
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,905
      - And we just laugh       
     because you're--you--      

297
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,206
           - I just--           
   - 'Cause we go like this,    

298
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,540
"Yeah," and you go,             
"It's so much simple, and,      

299
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:26,108
"you know, I thought about it,  
and you go like this.           

300
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,509
"And there's a four-count,      

301
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,010
and a four-count are so much    
better than a three-count."     

302
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,045
       - Yeah. You're not       
    the most time-efficient.    

303
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:32,546
   - I'm very detail-oriented   
         and neurotic.          

304
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:35,015
         My process is,         
 like, I sit there and examine  

305
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:37,250
    every little tiny thing,    

306
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:39,685
       tear it all apart,       
   and put it back together.    

307
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:41,954
    - This is where the big     
   black beans could come in.   

308
00:11:41,956 --> 00:11:44,089
      You see what I mean?      
             - No.              

309
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:45,957
    - Thorgy, is that not funny?
              Come on, that is--

310
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,090
                       - Uh, no,
       I don't think it's funny.

311
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:49,693
            - What?             
           - [groans]           

312
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:51,594
       - What sets me off       
        is this sound...        

313
00:11:51,596 --> 00:11:53,462
            [groans]            
          - [groans].           

314
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:55,364
             - Ugh.             
             - Ugh.             

315
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:58,366
           - [groans]           
           - [groans]           

316
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,968
         - Oh, my God.          
  You got to stop with, "Ugh."  

317
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,535
- I really don't                
mean it that way.               

318
00:12:02,537 --> 00:12:05,504
        I have an ear for music,
       rhythm, and, like, beats.

319
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,940
  I'm a professionally trained  
      violinist, violist,       

320
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,943
     and cellist, so, like,     
  I have a very critical ear.   

321
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,577
      Don't argue with me.      

322
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:14,112
  I just wish you would trust me
 when I say, like, a suggestion.

323
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,346
            - We do.            
       - We do trust you.       

324
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:17,347
    Do you not see yourself     
       all over the song?       

325
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:18,814
                    - All right,
                      now I know

326
00:12:18,816 --> 00:12:20,682
               that I can't even
   speak without being attacked.

327
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,950
- No, that's not true.          
Thorgy--                        

328
00:12:21,952 --> 00:12:26,020
  Thorgy is driving me crazy.   

329
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:29,189
     She's not contributing     
   as much as she's negating.   

330
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,858
                  - I'm actually
         holding back, like, 94%

331
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,159
                  of, like, what
         I actually want to say.

332
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:37,262
       - Thorgy, I really       
love this drape-y fabric on you.

333
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:38,730
            - Thank you so much.

334
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:41,600
- Oh, and then the other group's
       trying to sneak in       

335
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,034
  and break down our defenses.  

336
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:45,402
  - Is it an actual cardigan.   
     - Just a simple scarf.     

337
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:47,137
       - Thorgy, you are        
     so easily distracted.      

338
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,604
          Oh, my God.           

339
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:51,540
    And they're looking for     
the easiest chink in our armor, 

340
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,641
        and it's Thorgy.        

341
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:56,344
         - Thorgy, hi.          
             - Hey.             

342
00:12:56,346 --> 00:12:58,079
   They keep changing my lyrics.

343
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,647
          My lyrics are so good,
               and they're like,

344
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,348
      "Let's change it to this,"
       which is, like, idiotic--

345
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,183
           - Thorgy,            
     stop talking to them!      

346
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,550
             Jesus.             

347
00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,819
            [laughs]            

348
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,054
       <i> I'm just over it.</i>       
    <i> Whose team are you on?</i>     

349
00:13:09,056 --> 00:13:10,789
     Like, are you working      
     with the chicken wings     

350
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:11,989
   or whatever their fucking    
           names are?           

351
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,858
     - You guys are so fun.     

352
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,826
    Like, that's hilarious.     

353
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,662
      Team New York is in       
     a small, little boat,      

354
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,496
      and it's got a hole,

00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:40,328
     All right. Cue music.      
all:  It's called street meat 

474
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,462
            - Whoo!             

475
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:43,430
     -  No need to yell       

476
00:17:43,432 --> 00:17:45,131
    - All right, all right.     
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  

477
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:46,699
        So this is what         
       I'm talking about.       

478
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:49,434
You're saying it exactly the way
you'd say it in a musical.      

479
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,968
       What's that smell?       

480
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,338
   That sort of doesn't have    
     the cool, B-52s' vibe.     

481
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,705
           Right now            
     it's just reading as,      

482
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,074
         like, cheesy,          
  and you're just like, "Ehh."  

483
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,209
- I think the B-52s             
are kind of cheesy.             

484
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:04,145
      - The B-52s are just      
  one example of a party band.  

485
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,880
   I'm just trying to direct    
      you to be more cool       

486
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,715
         because that's         
    what this era was about.    

487
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:10,450
- That's how                    
they sound to me.               

488
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,952
      What do you mean by       
          "more cool"?          

489
00:18:12,954 --> 00:18:14,687
     I don't get that feel      
        from our track.         

490
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,789
      Am I alone in this?       
        Really? No one?         

491
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,423
  <i> - Girl, you got to listen.</i>   

492
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,558
         Open the ears,         
        close the mouth.        

493
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,760
  He's telling us to lay back,  
          stop be so,           

494
00:18:22,762 --> 00:18:25,897
                     "Hey, girl,
              yeah, whoo, yeah!"

495
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:28,532
- I just don't know what        
you're saying, Lucian, baby.    

496
00:18:28,534 --> 00:18:29,866
I just don't.                   

497
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:30,767
     - You don't understand     
        what I'm saying?        

498
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,101
             - No.              

499
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:33,803
   - It's just about creating   
        your own style.         

500
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:36,538
             Like,              
    even someone like Lorde.    

501
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,739
- I hate her.                   

502
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,407
       I can't with her.        
         - Okay. Well--         

503
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:44,410
     I'm just telling you,      
       she has her style.       

504
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:45,911
   - When you think of Lorde,   
       I think of, like,        

505
00:18:45,913 --> 00:18:47,846
      apathetic teenager.       

506
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,547
Av--Ooh.                        

507
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,383
 - I'm just trying to help you. 
  - I guess so I'll be Lorde.   

508
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:53,517
     - It's very surprising     

509
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,719
         that any queen         
       would come for me        

510
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:59,188
       because I'm gonna        
   be judging these bitches.    

511
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,223
         I'm not saying         
          to be Lorde.          

512
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,824
         I'm not saying         
        to be the B-52s,        

513
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:04,959
         but it can be          
   some other sort of melody    

514
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:06,493
      that is your thing.       
          - It's like,          

515
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,795
     "You're not the B-52s,     
  but how would B-52s say it?"  

516
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,730
       Is what it sounds        
          like to me.           

517
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,932
         <i> - Oh, my God.</i>         

518
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:14,500
    You are embarrassing us     
      in front of a judge.      

519
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:17,269
    If we're in the bottom,     
   Bob is going home, not me.   

520
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:18,937
     <i> - I know I shouldn't</i>      
    <i> be arguing with Lucian.</i>    

521
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:21,672
     I know I shouldn't be,     
but I'm already in argument-mode

522
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:24,775
   because Thorgy has got me    
 at the very edge of the cliff. 

523
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,944
         <i> Lucian's just</i>         
    <i> an innocent bystander.</i>     

524
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:29,880
    I think I may have just,    
 like, cost us this challenge.  

525
00:19:31,783 --> 00:19:34,483
     <i> [upbeat mellow music]</i>     

526
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,885
                   - Drag is not
             a cheap profession.

527
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,855
       - It's really not.       

528
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,656
    - I know. You got to do     
  what you got to do to live.   

529
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,257
            - Do you have enough
          to, like, live off of?

530
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:45,593
        - We were always        
        fortunate kids,         

531
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,528
       but we didn't have       
   a lot of money growing up.   

532
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,329
So when I got                   
out of high school,             

533
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,998
I started getting               
all these loans                 

534
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,165
and just started                

535
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,833
     trying to find money.      
            - Yeah.             

536
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:59,037
- And now I'm going             
through a bankruptcy.           

537
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,272
             - Wow.             
     How much is your debt?     

538
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,440
         - It's, like,          
   in the tens of thousands.    

539
00:20:03,442 --> 00:20:05,808

541
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:11,479
         Being broke is         
       a hurting feeling.

543
00:20:13,716 --> 00:20:16,483
     but when you literally     
       don't have a dime,       

544
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:19,653

  these girls understand that.  

547

      Not having the money      
         to buy fabric          

548
00:20:27,695 --> 00:20:30,695

     I just use what I got,     

549
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,797
    and that's where I find     
  myself saying, "Oh, I'm here  

550
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,832
       for the $100,000,"       
     you know what I mean?      

551
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,033
                         - Yeah.

552
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,000

for the experience,             

553
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,301
but in the back of my mind,     

554
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:41,570
I just feel like                
I need money,                   

555
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:43,672
        and it's not all        
   about money all the time.    

556
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:46,040
 That's exactly why the stakes  

557
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:48,175
      in this competition       
       is so high to me.        

558
00:20:48,177 --> 00:20:52,545
       It's not an option       
        for me to fail.         

559
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:53,913
- I'm gonna put my hair up      
and do my makeup,               

560
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:55,647

       - Yeah, I am too.        

561
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:56,814
- I'm always,                   
like, the last person           

562
00:20:56,816 --> 00:20:58,115
running around                  
with my head cut off.           

563
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,717
        - And yet you still win.

564
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,786
          Every time.           
       - I've never won.        

565
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:04,487
                   - Frida Kahlo
          got a special mention.

566
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:05,988
  - Yeah, a special mention...  
      - That was winning.       

567
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,256
- That I was good               
at the dance challenge          

568
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:08,890
but didn't win,                 
but I was top,                  

569
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,324
        and then we did         
     the acting challenge,      

570
00:21:10,326 --> 00:21:11,491
and I was, like--they were like,
     "You were really good,

00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:12,591
             but--"             
             - Yup.             

572
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:13,792
- I feel like                   
I'm the Susan Lucci.            

573
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:15,059
           - [gasps]            
        Come on. Susan?         

574
00:21:15,061 --> 00:21:16,627

     as loud and annoying.      

581
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:30,137
        They were like,

     for that breakthrough.

       your ass is real?        

829
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:38,691
       - Yes. It's real.        

830
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:40,726
  - You got it from your Mama.  
        - And my daddy.         

831
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:43,628
     - Does your daddy deal     
   in medical-grade silicone?   

832
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,330

833
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:47,664
         - This is fun.         

834
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,031
   I think this is something    
       different for you.

         Now the outfit         
         in the group,

      <i> part Dolly Parton,</i>       

838
00:31:53,904 --> 00:31:55,870
      and then the circle       
  that wasn't really a circle.  

839
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,872
    - In terms of the outfit    
         in your group,         

840
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,306
  were you in charge of that?   

841
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,773
  - It was a group challenge,   

842
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:02,141
   so we really participated    

843
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:03,808
        with everything         
      when it--you know--       

844
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,177
       - Well, Chi Chi's        
       shaking her head.        

845
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,245
    You're saying it was not    
        a group effort?         

846
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:10,246
        - No, the thing         
    Thorgy had on her head,     

847
00:32:10,248 --> 00:32:13,282
      that's what I wanted      
 to wear as the actual costume. 

848
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:14,449
            - I see.            

849
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:15,717
- I'm not gonna                 
be in a cardboard box.          

850
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:16,984
        Absolutely not.         

851
00:32:16,986 --> 00:32:18,586
      - Is this the first       
      you all are hearing       

852
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,687
  any dissention from Chi Chi?  

853
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,688
  - She was just disconnected.  
            - I see.            

854
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,990
   - You know, like, it was,    
      like, "Hey, Chi Chi,      

855
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:25,457
  "you want to come over here   
         really quick?          

856
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:27,126
   You know, we're gonna look   
      at some references,"      

857
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,928
         and it's like,         
     "All right. Whatever."     

858
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,928
       - Well, they was--       

859
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,129
        - I was told to         
        step my drag up,        

860
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:34,064
        and that's what         
        I wanted to do.         

861
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:35,765
    - So tell me why you're     
   out here in a bathing suit   

862
00:32:35,767 --> 00:32:37,700
   with no corset and a belt.   

863
00:32:37,702 --> 00:32:41,604
  - I don't have the expenses   
to pay for something like this. 

864
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:43,405
      I'm in a bankruptcy.      
      I just don't have--       

865
00:32:43,407 --> 00:32:44,539
           - Hold on.           

866
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,040
     You don't need money,      
             girl.              

867
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:48,042
    That's never an excuse.     

868
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:49,710
  I know you can turn a show.   

869
00:32:49,712 --> 00:32:53,880
        What concerns me        
 is the attitude a little bit.  

870
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:55,748
    I'm getting the feeling     
 that you have fought very hard 

871
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,015
      to be where you are.      

872
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,517
           I get it,            
   but we're lifting you up.    

873
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,985
            Let us.             

874
00:33:00,987 --> 00:33:02,286
         - I hear you.          

875
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:03,587
               I'm sorry, y'all,
                 that, you know,

876
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,021
                  I just kind of
                halfed it, and--

877
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,589
      - No, no, it's okay.      
       It's cool, sister.       

878
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,123
      - I don't want y'all      
  to feel like that, you know,  

879
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,524
     I tried to throw y'all     
under the bus or anything, but--

880
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:11,825
       - What is this bus       
 everybody keeps talking about? 

881
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:13,160

882
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:16,095

           [laughter]           

883
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:19,331
       Thank you, ladies.       
  While you un-tuck backstage,  

884
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,499
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.

         All right, now         
 just between us Sunday girls,  

887
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,738
       what do you think?       

888
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,406
        Let's start with        
      Bob The Drag Queen.       

889
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:31,808
      - Bob was giving me       
       a little attitude,       

890
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,978
          but this is           
  a high-pressure competition.  

891
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,412
         - Absolutely.          

892
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:37,780
- And I think personality things
     that they may not even     

893
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,915
       like in themselves       
      sometimes come out.       

894
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:41,783
   <i> - And Bob did stand out.</i>    

895
00:33:41,785 --> 00:33:43,752
   Bob has a lot of charisma    

896
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:46,020
  and seems to know who he is.  

897
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,253
        <i> - Thorgy Thor.</i>         

898
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:49,655
        - She delivered         
       on this challenge.       

899
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:51,824
    <i> There's just something</i>     
     <i> so quirky about her.</i>      

900
00:33:51,826 --> 00:33:53,825
           - I agree.           
  I was totally drawn to her.   

901
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:55,559
  - Michelle, you had an issue  
        with her outfit.        

902
00:33:55,561 --> 00:33:57,461
    - There was just so much    
           going on.            

903
00:33:57,463 --> 00:33:59,263
 - Did she paint sideburns on?  

904
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:02,265
     - Down her cheekbones      
    and around her jawline,     

905
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:03,766
        <i> down her neck,</i>         
      <i> and down her arms.</i>       

906
00:34:03,768 --> 00:34:06,402
    - I think her challenge     
      in this competition       

907
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:08,237
      is to edit it down.

          <i> Acid Betty.</i>          

909
00:34:09,573 --> 00:34:11,272
 - You know, I watch this show  
         all the time,          

910
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:13,440
   and I was kind of waiting    
     for this "Wow" moment,     

911
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:15,975
  and that was Betty's runway.  

912
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:18,110
        - But her outfit        
       in the performance       

913
00:34:18,112 --> 00:34:19,912
 just was not cohesive for me,  

914
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:21,413
       and because of it,       

915
00:34:21,415 --> 00:34:23,882
she was completely swallowed up 
   by those other two girls.    

916
00:34:23,884 --> 00:34:25,316
       <i> - Derrick Barry.</i>

      <i> - Most frustrating</i>       
        <i> thing, for me,</i>         

918
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:29,886
    is how temporary Derrick    
       is in performing.        

919
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:32,322
     And she's so not used      
    to performing something     

920
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:33,723
      other than Britney.       

921
00:34:33,725 --> 00:34:36,158
      - But she, you know,      
really had an outstanding voice.

922
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,259
        - But it's hard         
      to judge her as her,      

923
00:34:38,261 --> 00:34:40,260
          because Ru,           
   think about Chad Michaels.   

924
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:41,494
           - Mm-hmm.            

925
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,896
       - She can do tons        
    of other drag than Cher.    

926
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:47,566
   Derrick has to find a way    
  to break through that mold.

928

931
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,372
  and we brought Naysha back.   

932
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,340
 - She wants to be here so bad, 
          I can tell.           

933
00:34:58,342 --> 00:34:59,841
           - Uh-huh.            
    - She's trying so hard,     

934
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,643
        but I don't know        
  if she is giving us enough.

      <i> - Chi Chi DeVayne.</i>       

936
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,513

  she was the standout for me.  

937
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:10,783
- She does have this mysterious 
       magnetic quality.        

938
00:35:10,785 --> 00:35:13,384
   - On the runway, however,
