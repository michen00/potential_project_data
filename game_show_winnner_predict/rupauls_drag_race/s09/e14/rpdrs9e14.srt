00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,183
First, a groundbreaking queen
from New York City.

146
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,351
Take a look.

147
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,719
[Peppermint]
<i><font color="white">I am Peppermint,</font></i>

148
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,655

157
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:19,272
[cheers and applause]

158
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,440
Hey, Peppermint.

159
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,809
Hey, Ru.

160
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:23,977
Now, we are all
looking forward

161
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,746
to some killer lip syncs
this evening.

162
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,881
Are you ready?

163
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,617
-Are you ready?
-Oh, yeah, I'm ready.

164
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:32,152
[laughs]

165
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,888
Now, you've been dubbed the
lip sync assassin this season.

166
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,356
What do you say to that?

167
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:40,260
I say just let me know
where to aim.

168
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,395
[laughs]

169
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,532
[cheers and applause]

170
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,135
Now, who's here
to support you tonight?

171
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,838
Well, I have
my beautiful mother

172
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,306
here to support me.

173
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:54,808
Hi, Mama Peppermint.

174
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,544
And one of
my closest girlfriends,

175
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,846
Ms. Trace Lysette
from <i><font color="white">Transparent.</font></i>

176
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,781
Hey, girl.
So, Trace, what was

177
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,250
your favorite Peppermint moment
this season?

178
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,552
Her lip syncs,

179
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,655
because
there is no substitute

180
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,257
for stage presence
and talent.

181
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,760
-Ooh!
-Thank you, Trace.

182
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,130
Now, Peppermint,
we have a surprise message

183
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:19,599
from an old pal of yours.

184
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,767
Take a look.

185
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,270
Peppermint,
I am so proud of you, girl.

186
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,941
You have been my sister
for so many years,

187
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,609
and that has made it
that much sweeter

188
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,977
watching you shine,

189
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,848
showing the world that being
a proud transgender woman

190
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,549
is not incompatible

191
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,753
with being America's
next drag superstar.

192
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,354
You can have them both.

193
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,555
I love you, Peppermint.

194
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,124
I love you, <i><font color="white">Drag Race.</font></i>

195
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,494
Shantay, you will
always stay in my heart.

196
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,997
Now, Peppermint,
a lot of people get confused

197
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:53,033
about how can you be
a proud transwoman

198
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,167
and be a drag queen.

199
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,935
What do you say
to those people?

200
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,670
Transwomen
have always contributed

201
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,006
to the wonderful art form
of drag

202
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,308
since the beginning of time.

203
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,044
This is not new,

204
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,479
and my contribution to drag

205
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,049
is as powerful
as any gay man.

206
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,051
One last question.

207
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,753
Now, since this season's
makeover challenge,

208
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,357
have you heard from
our cameraman Sarge?

209
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,428
{n8}Uh, I have not.

210
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:24,397
Unfortunately,
Sarge had another job,

211
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,399
but we did find Wintergreen

212
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:28,401
hanging out
in the parking lot

213
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:30,537
at the Waffle Hut
in Pacoima.

214
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,872
Please welcome back
Wintergreen.

215
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,575
[cheers and applause]

216
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,079
[laughs]

217
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,882
Oh!

218
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,086
Wintergreen,
you look marvelous.

219
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,255
This is all you, honey.

220
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,957
[all laugh]

221
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:54,527
Well, Peppermint,

222
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,463
thank you for giving us
Wintergreen

223
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:01,134
and for filling this season
with sass and class.

224
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,903
[applause]

225
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,840
Next, a queen
who blew our minds

226
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,641
with her beauty
and her brains.

227
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:09,742
Take a look.

<i><font color="white">in river.</font></i>

232
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,387
There's something
extremely modern

233
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,722
about your style.

Sasha Velour, welcome.

239

[cheers and applause]

240
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,438
Now, you were never
in the bottom this season.

241
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,240
You never had to lip sync
for your life.

242
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,876
Are you ready to lip sync for
the crown tonight?

243
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,177
I mean, that's the thing.

244
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:46,713
If I actually do have
a regret about this season,

245
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,648
it's not getting to show
the passion

246
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:50,517
that I love getting
to express in the lip sync.

247
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,518
I'm thrilled.
I'm ready.

248
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,119
Good. Good.

249
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:54,621
[cheers and applause]

250
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,157
Sasha, this season
you helped teach the children

251
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,859
about our rich gay history.

252
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,328
Yeah, they say that
if you look into a mirror

253
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,797
and talk about sad things,
I appear behind you

254
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:07,267
to give you
a queer history lesson.

255
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,668
[laughs]

256
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,670
Drag queens
have always been the keepers

257
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:11,938
of our queer history.

258
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,274
We make it, we tell it,

259
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,109
we remember it,
we mis-remember it,

260
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,111
and we love it,
and I'm so glad

261
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,346
that I got to help
bring that tradition

262
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,981
onto the show
in my own little way.

263
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,017
[cheers and applause]

264
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,486
Okay, now are you ready
for a surprise message

265
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,588
from a big fan of yours?

266
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,622
{n8}-Sure.
-All right.

267
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,024
Hey, Sasha,
it's Katy Perry.

268
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,525
I'm so sorry
I can't be there.

269
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,928
I just want to say hello
and that I love you

270
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,863
and thank God for you.

271
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,232
[cheers and applause]

272
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,767
[RuPaul] Isn't that wonderful?

273
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,870
So, Sasha, who's here
rooting for you tonight?

274
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,674
Well, I have my dad,
Papa Velour.

275
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,175
[RuPaul] Well.

276
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:52,045
And my boyfriend
Johnny Velour.

277
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,782
Ahh. Now, what was it like
watching Sasha?

278
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,017
You did watch the show
on television, right?

279
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:01,020
{n8}We often did watch parties
at my house in Illinois.

280
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,823
{n8}I watched every show
and all the "Untuckeds"

281
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,258
sometimes more than once.

282
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,261
[cheers and applause]

283
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,799
Now, I've heard you,
Sasha, talk before

284
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:17,237
about how your late mother
inspired your drag.

285
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:21,007
What do you think she'd say
if she were here tonight?

286
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,776
She'd say, "Too much."

287
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:27,547
Seriously, I think
she would be so proud of me

288
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,882
for going from
a little boy

289
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,252
who wore dresses
in the living room

290
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,188
to a little boy who wore
dresses on this grand finale.

291
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,322
I love it.

292
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:39,125
[cheers and applause]

293
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:42,061
Okay, now,
what would it mean to you

294
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,964
to be crowned
America's next drag superstar?

295
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,300
It would be
a dream come true.

296
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:48,635
An honor.

297
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,737
I feel that
the drag I do

298
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,039
is a little bit different.

299
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,808
It pushes the boundaries
for what people might expect.

300
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,845
And I believe that
that is the future of drag,

301
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,147
and I am so honored
to represent that.

302
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,149
[cheers and applause]

303
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,051
Sasha Velour,
I want to thank you

304
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,552
for sharing your uniqueness

305
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,554
and elevating
this competition.

306
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,690
Now, in moments
our top four queens

307
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,493
will face off
in an epic lip sync smackdown

308
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,727
for the crown.

309
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,331
But first, our next queen
is a true triple threat.

310
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,999
She's funny,
she can lip sync,

311
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,536
and she looks good
with a hotdog on her head.

Shantay, Coulee.
What do you say?

322
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,297
Are you ready to lip sync
for the crown tonight?

323
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,433
-I was born ready, Ru.
-Ooh, all right.

324
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,069
[cheers and applause]

325
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,037
So tell me this.

326
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,473
Who would you not want
to lip sync against?

327
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,276
Sasha and I have
a really great friendship,

328
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,778
and I know it would be
super dramatic

329
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,381
if we had to lip sync
against one another.

330
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:11,417
Luckily I'm a messy bitch
who loves drama.

331
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:14,253
[laughs]

332
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,325
Now, I know
that you and your family

333
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:23,262
have had a really rough go
of it this past year.

334
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,200
Do you mind talking
a little bit about that?

335
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,504
Um...two days before
the cast was announced,

336
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:35,041
I lost my dad to cancer.

337
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:40,446
And...a month after that,
I lost my sister to cancer.

338
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,082
And my dad,

339
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,185
we had gone through such
an amazing journey together,

340
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:51,290
of him understanding me and
learning about who I was and...

341
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,729
[Shea]
I know that he watches me.

342
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,698
-Absolutely.
-And I feel him.

343
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,566
-Yeah.
-All the time.

344
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,069
-Sorry.
-[RuPaul] Yes. I feel that.

345
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,806
[cheers and applause]

346
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,574
Now, you told me

347
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,344
that your mother
is a minister.

348
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,946
[laughs] Yes. I mean,
she's a reverend now.

349
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,182
-She done come up.
-Oh.

350
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,184
Are you Reverend Coulee?

351
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,787
-Yes.
-Hello.

352
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:21,954
[applause]

353
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,159
Does Shea take after you
or her father?

354
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,162
His creativity
comes from his father.

355
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,831
His rhythm comes from me.

356
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,766
[laughter and applause]

357
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,702
All right.
Thank you, Reverend Coulee.

358
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,804
Thank you very much.

359
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,572
You're welcome.

360
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:42,341
Now, Shea,
one of my favorite moments

361
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,446
is when you took
the character of Blac Chyna,

362
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,316
and I'm not the only one
who felt it was stellar.

363
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,384
Hey, Shea Coulee.

364
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,019
Honey,
you did not come to play.

365
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,086
You came to slay.

366
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,588
And yes,
you did steal the show,

367
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,824
I mean, 'cause
that's what Blac Chyna does.

368
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,893
Now make sure you go out there
and get that crown.

369
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,228
All right, I love you.

370
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,763
All right,
I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.

371
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,133
[cheers and applause]

372
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,902
Whoa!

373
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,903
That was a nice car.

374
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,705
-It certainly was.
-Yeah.

375
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,007
So what would it mean
to you

376
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,643
to become America's
next drag superstar?

377
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,945
It would be an era

378
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,547
of sickening
black drag queens

379
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:25,318
running this world
continued.

380
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,119
I love it.

381
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:30,890
Shea Coulee, thank you
for showing the children

382
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:33,092
how it is done.

384
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,865
Up next, a queen
who is so much more

385
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,600
than just a tight tuck.

386
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,003
She's got a big,
juicy ass, too.

[RuPaul]
Trinity, when you started the season,

397
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,660
your approval ratings
were low.

398
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:10,196
But you turned things
around.

399
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,697
How'd you do that?

400
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,267
And speak slow
because Donald Trump is watching

401
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,535
and he wants to know.

402
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,970
[cheers and laughter]

403
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,207
Honestly, I have
a resting bitch face.

404
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,311
It's just people hate me
until they get to know me

405
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,512
and they get to know
my humor,

406
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,316
and then apparently
America likes it, so...

407
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,951
-[laughter and applause]
-Carry on.

408
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,087
So who's here
supporting you tonight?

409
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:41,327
I have
my much older sister Ginger

410
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:43,930
and my sugar dad--

411
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,765
I mean,
my new boyfriend Leo.

412

[RuPaul] Oh.

413
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,468
How'd you two meet?

414
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:53,806
Well, I'm a good Southern
Baptist Christian lady,

415
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,975
-so church.
-[RuPaul] Oh, at church,

416
00:17:56,042 --> 00:18:00,012

an adult gay dating app.

[RuPaul] Oh.
[laughter and applause]

418
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,385
Leo, had you seen Trinity
on TV before?

419
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:07,720
Yes, I did.

420
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,056
And did you think
I'm gonna get some of that?

421
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,292
And I sure did
and then some.

-Yes.
-[RuPaul] Oh, I love it.

424
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,301
Now, Trinity, your tuck got
a lot of attention this season,

425
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,204
especially from
the gorgeous Chris Pine

426
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,340
and the boys
at <i><font color="white">Saturday Night Live.</font></i>

427
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,076
See that?

428
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:33,346
What was that like for you?

429
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,014
Girl, I just wanted
to drop to my knees

430
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,383
and climb him like a tree.

Yes.

445
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:08,180
Okay, Trinity,
are you nervous

446
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,582
about lip syncing tonight?

447
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:10,850
Absolutely not.

448
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,019
This is what I do.
I'm a performer.

449
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:15,655
So who would you not want
to lip sync against?

450
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,590
None of 'em, girl.
Bring 'em on, honey.

451
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,924
I'll lip sync to all of 'em.

452
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,960
Send 'em all packing, bitch.

453
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,395

454
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,430

Trinity Taylor.

455
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,465
[cheers and applause]

456
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,570
Ladies and gentlemen,

457
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,840
welcome to the stage
our top four.

458
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:37,410
[cheers and applause]

459
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,412
Tonight one of you

460
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,481
will become America's
next drag superstar.

461
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,851
But for the first time
in <i><font color="white">Drag Race </font></i>herstory,

462
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,954
to win,
you will have to survive

463
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,591
a lip sync smackdown
for the crown.

464
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,061
To explain how it works,

465
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,763
here's our special
<i><font color="white">Drag Race </font></i>correspondent

466
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,964
Ross Mathews.

467
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,500
Okay, tonight we'll start
with four queens

468
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,903
but only one queen
will take the crown.

469
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,805
First, a spin of the wheel

470
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,007
determines which two queens
will face off

471
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,608
in lip sync number one.

472
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,610
Then the remaining
two queens

473
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,979
will face off
in lip sync number two.

474
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,215
The winners
of those two lip syncs

475
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:17,783
will then go head to head

476
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,920
in the final
lip sync for the crown.

477
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,421
And the winner will become

478
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,324
America's
next drag superstar.

479
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,593
I'm so excited.

480
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,295
I'm gonna need to change.

481
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,297
Ru, back to you.

482
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,364
Thank you, Ross.

483
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,333
That sounds a lot like math.

484
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,002
Now, on this wheel

485
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,839
are the names
of our top four queens.

486
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,907
Wherever the wheel stops

487

But first, a queen

this past year?

661
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,789
You get to travel
the world

662
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,591
and realize how many people
you've actually touched.

663
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,993
And let me tell you,
I've touched a lot of people.

664
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,796
[laughs]

665
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,966
So what's next for you?
