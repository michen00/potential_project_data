00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:08,572
      Are you ready to see      
        my Coo-Coo again?

00:00:08,574 --> 00:00:10,640
     (laughter and applause)

00:00:10,642 --> 00:00:12,042
      I'm back,<i> mis amores.</i>

00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:22,050
       - Guide me, Jesus.       

8
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:33,094
           - I'm back.          

9
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,262
          - Oh, my God.         

10
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,430
     Welcome back, Cynthia.     

11
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:38,131
           - Oh, God.           

12
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:39,532
        - Congratulations       
         to the winner.         

13
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:40,799
       - Thank you, doll.       
           Thank you.           

14
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,201
   And congrats on you getting  
    better with your health.    

15
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:44,769
   - It was a roller coaster.   
            - Right.            

16
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:46,470
   - But, you know, I'm here.   

17
00:00:46,472 --> 00:00:49,439
      I was diagnosed with      
     liver cancer stage one,    

18
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:53,642
      but I'm in remission      
  and I feel healthier as ever. 

19
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:55,577
           My Coo-Coo           
       is fantastic, girl.      

20
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:57,812
       I'm not gonna take       
         the opportunity        

21
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,914
   that RuPaul has given to me  
           in granted.          

22
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,816
     This Coo-Coo is ready.     

23
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,819
          This is home.         

24
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,320
     - I don't want to sound    
    like a hater or anything,   

25
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:08,822
       but, like, is this,      
          like, a joke          

26
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:11,524
           or are you           
     legitimately back, sis?    

27
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:13,926
        - Baby, I'm back.       

28
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:15,460
             I know             
     I'm Miss Congeniality,     

29
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:18,195
      but I'm no came here      
         to play games.         

30
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:21,865
    - I'm happy that Cynthia    
  is getting her second chance, 

31
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:24,000
     but on the other hand,     

32
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,803
          I'm like, oh,         
        we got this bitch       

33
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:30,973
       that already knows       
        this competition,       

34
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:33,842
      and that can get you      
         very, very far.        

35
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,677
          - I'm afraid          
     of what's coming next.     

36
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:37,011
   This just got real, honey.   

37
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,079
            - Ha-ha!            

38
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:42,415
  - (sighs) I'm not very happy  
      that Cynthia is back.     

39
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,683
     She could take us out.     

40
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,385
     - Hallelujah, my pussy     
   and my Coo-Coo is burning.   

41
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,820
    - I haven't yet seen this   
   infamous Coo-Coo of yours,   

42
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,121
      and I need to see it,     

43
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:53,658
   because if you're gonna say  
       Coo-Coo around me,       

44
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,459

     looks better than mine.    

45
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:56,694
             - Ooh.

       Just click-clacking     
             about

 Fine fresh feminine style... 
         - Good morning.

       wootity, woo-woo        

59
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,589
  - I didn't know this Coo-Coo  
      was happening today.      

60
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,292
             (alarm)            
             - Ooh!             

61
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:38,528
           - She done           
    already done had herses.    

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,596
       - If you can't love      
            yourself,           

63
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:41,597
             let me.            

64
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,732
      I'm your biggest fan.     

65
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:45,466
        Your number one.        

66
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:49,570
   Well, technically, only one  
    of you can be number one,   

67
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:52,006
       so the rest of you       
       are, like, losers.       

68
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:54,007
         Sorry about it.        

69
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,876
           (all laugh)          

70
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,446
     - Hello, hello, hello!     

71
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:04,116
    (screaming and cheering)    

72
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:06,952
      - Lisa mother fucking     
             Kudrow.            

73
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,221
          I am gagged.          

74
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:16,093
   - Lady Gaga was just here,   
      and now Lisa Kudrow.      

75
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,894
  I'm really digging Season 9.  

76
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:21,898
       - Say hi to my pal       
          Lisa Kudrow.          

77
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,000
      (cheers and applause)     
              - Hi.             

78
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:26,869
      - I just ran into her     
           on the lot,          

79
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,505
   and she wanted to come over  
         and say hello.         

80
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:30,873
  - Yeah, you guys look great.  

81
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,874
       - Oh, my God, stop.      

82
00:03:32,876 --> 00:03:36,444
           - (laughs)           
 - Lisa's character Val Cherish 

83
00:03:36,446 --> 00:03:38,613
     from the brilliant show    
         "The Comeback,"        

84
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:42,082
          is the reason         
    I say hello, hello, hello   

85
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:44,651
           every time           
    I walk into the workroom.   

86
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:46,552
       Did you know that?       
              - No!             

87
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:49,421
      - I didn't know that.     
        - Neither did I.        

88
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,289
           (all laugh)          

89
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,525
   - Now, Lisa, would you mind  
      saying that one thing     

90
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:57,461
          that you say          
         for me, please?        

91
00:03:57,463 --> 00:03:58,762
        - Well, I got it.       

92
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,363
           (all laugh)          

93
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,799
        - That was good,        
   but can you say it happier?  

94
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,433
        - Well, I got it.       

95
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:05,901
        - Bigger, bigger.       

96
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,135
        - Well, I got it!       

97
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:10,037
           (all laugh)          

98
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,372
     Now I look like a fool.    

99
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,473
           - (laughs)           

100
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:16,109
    Lisa, come back any time.   

101
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:17,376
         - Okay, thanks.        
      - Thank you, darling.     

102
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,678
           Mwah, mwah.          
      (cheers and applause)     

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,145
             - Bye!             

104
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:24,982
        - Ladies, I have        
  a little secret to tell you.  

105
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:29,320
    When I was a little kid,    
  I wanted to be a cheerleader. 

106
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:30,820
           (cheering)           

107
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:32,989
    I loved the short skirts,   

108
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:36,492
       the sassy comebacks      
   and the death drop splits.   

109
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,894
       So for this week's       
         maxi challenge,        

110
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:41,896

     in the biggest, baddest    

111
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,932

113
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:48,002
           (all laugh)          

114
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:51,238
    First, you need to divide   
        into two squads.        

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,340
   Nina Bo'nina Brown, you won  
     last week's challenge,

       head cheerleaders.

121
00:05:08,955 --> 00:05:10,353
       - Ooh, you playing       
         the race card?         

122
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:11,754
           (all laugh)          

123
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,088
            Cynthia.            
            - Kimora.           

124
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,189
              - Oh.             

125
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:16,290
    - My team is going to be    
        the Coo-Coo team.       

126
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,892
            - Alexis.           

127
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,160
            - Eureka!           

128
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,927
         - Oh, come on.         

129
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:22,928
             - Aja.             

130
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,529
           (applause)           

131
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,629
         - Farrah Moan.         

132
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,133
       - Oh, team Coo-Coo,      
        team Coo-Coo, go!       

133
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,834
        - I choose Sasha.       
             - Yes!             

134
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:32,168
           (applause)           

135
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,469
          - Peppermint.         

136
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:35,770
           (applause)           

137
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:39,407
  - Because I have a heart for  
 the underdog, I choose Jaymes. 

138
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,309
              - Aw.             
              - Aw.             

139
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:44,377
      - She was just doing      
       community service.       

140
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,478
              - Oh!             

141
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,280
          - I'm feeling         
     a little self conscious    

142
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:50,549
       about being labeled      
          an underdog,          

143
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,351
    because I consider myself   
     very much a competitor.    

144
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,153
          - All right.          
        Welcome, Trinity.       

145
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,855
              Yes!              

146
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:03,525
       - I choose Charlie.      

147
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:04,892
           (applause)           

148
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:08,962
    - Which means Valentina,    
    you're on Coo-Coo's team.   

149
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:11,364
     - I feel like Valentina    
         was picked last        

150
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,764
             because            
     she's already mentioned    

151
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,133
   she's only been doing drag   
         for 10 months.         

152
00:06:15,135 --> 00:06:19,870
   So I think we're all like,   
    well, what can she bring?   

153
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:22,672
     - It doesn't feel good     
       to be chosen last,       

154
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,540
           but little           
      do these queens know      

155
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:28,978
       that in their team       
     they got the superstar.    

156
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,745
   - Team Nina Bo'nina Brown,   

157
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:32,914
       you'll be cheering       
       for the home team,       

158
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:35,082
       RuPaul's Glamazons.      

159
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:37,251
          - Yes, honey.         
             - Yes.             

160
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:38,985
       - And Team Coo-Coo,      
       you'll be cheering       

161
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:44,123
      for our extra special     
    guest judges, the B-52s.    

162
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,790
             - Yes!             
           (applause)           

163
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:48,960
     - Kate, Fred and Cindy     
       gave me a big break      

164
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:52,529
when they cast me in their music
     video for "Love Shack."    

165
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:55,065
             - Ooh!             
           - Oh, yeah!          

166
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:58,234
     - All right, gentlemen,    
       start your engines.      

167
00:06:58,236 --> 00:07:00,837
   And may the best woman win.  

168
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,338
          - So anybody          
    have any insight so far?    

169
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,274
       - There's literally      
        like an adjective       

170
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,974
     for every single queen.    
            - Mm-hmm.           

171
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,776
          - So I think          
    we should go through that   

172
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:13,479
  and assess, like, who matches 
    the description the most.   

173
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:15,647
   - Doll, I want to be sassy.  

174
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:16,982
             - Okay.            

175
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:18,883
       - Can I be flirty?       
      - You can have that.      

176
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,718
       - I think that now       
      would be a great time     

177
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,553
         for Jaymes to--        
     if you want to, like--     

178
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:25,155
        - Yes, to really        
          show himself.         

179
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:28,524
- If you do snoozy in funny way,
       it would be funny.       

180
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,259
        - I think floozy        
         is more my role        

181
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,493
      'cause it's all about     
           high energy          

182
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:32,860
          and all about         
       being over the top.      

183
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,461
      - Impact, yeah, yeah.     

184
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:37,464
        - I want floozy.        
             - Ooh.             

185
00:07:37,466 --> 00:07:38,832
      - Take snoozy, girl.      

186
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,399
       It'll be hilarious.      

187
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:42,033
         It'll be great.        

188
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,734
         I'm not snoozy.        

189
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,002
     I'm just--it's not me.     

190
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:47,804
       - Honestly, Alexis,      
           I feel like          

191
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,838
       even though, like,       
   snoozy may be a challenge,   

192
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,906
  I think it's a challenge that 
   you can definitely rise to.  

193
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:54,208
   - The other girls assure me  

194
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,843
      and encourage me that     
     I can make snoozy work.    

195
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:59,045
       You're right, girl.      
     I can do any of these.     

196
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:00,346
   - And these are characters.  

197
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:01,880
    - And you're sure you're    
     comfortable with that?     

198
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,181
    - I'll do whatever, yeah.   

199
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,050
       And they're right.       
         I'm an actress.        

200
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,584
 - Should we, like, stand up and
  do it, just so we have like-- 

201
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,120
       - Yeah, do you want      
       to get it off the--      

202
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:10,620
           - Ru call.           

203
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:12,455
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.   

204
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,724
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.   

205
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:17,227
    - Jaymes, I'm Jews--ugh.    

206
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,430
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.     

207
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:23,131
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.     

208
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,033
    - I'm Jaymes and I'm--oh.   

209
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,968
  I'm Jaymes and I'm a floozy.  

210
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,169
    - Wait, wait, wait, wait.   

211
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,303
     I don't think your part    
       comes in that late.      

212
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:32,372
   - You got to jump right in.  
          - Yeah, yeah.         

213
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:33,373
     - It's got a slow beat     
             to it.             

214
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,874
    - No, but you have to do    
         the first beat.        

215
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:37,943
       - You start in time      
and then you stretch the floozy.

216
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:40,211
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.   

217
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:42,446
    - I'm Alexis, I'm snoozy.   

218
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:45,583
        - And I'm Jaymes        
        and I'm a floozy.       

219
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,351
   - Captain, may I speak out   
    of turn for a little bit?   

220
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:49,352
          - Of course.          
            Go ahead.           

221
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:50,954
             - Girl,            
     you gotta sell floozy.     

222
00:08:50,956 --> 00:08:52,921
 If you wanted to be the floozy,
    you gotta be the floozy.    

223
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,856
          - All right.          
 - I'm not seeing it yet, okay? 

224
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,490
            I'm not--           
    I want to encourage you.    

225
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:58,492
     I'm just saying, do it.    
          Do it, girl.          

226
00:08:58,494 --> 00:09:00,059
          Come forward.         

227
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:04,563
      - Jaymes doesn't seem     
      to be here mentally,      

228
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:06,364
    and this is not the time    

229
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:09,300
    to be figuring out how to   
   get your mind in the game.   

230
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:11,302
   It already has to be there.  

231
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,970
   - It's gonna be a long day.  

232
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,571
         - Coming up...         

233
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:16,806
             - Whoo!            
             - Aah!             

234
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,407
          - Oh, my God!         

235
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:23,745
      I cannot believe what     
    they are asking us to do.   

236
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:26,514
   - There's gonna be a severe  
     injury on this episode.    

237
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,483
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)  

238
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,918
         (RuPaul laughs)        

239
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,252
       - All right, guys.       

240
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:35,086
    Five, six, seven, eight.    

241
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,687
            Let's go!           

242
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,590
    - Today's maxi challenge    
        is a straight up        

243
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:43,594
       "Bring It On" style      
      cheer battle, bitch.      

244
00:09:43,596 --> 00:09:45,329
      - Why don't we do it      
         one more time.         

245
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,997
   I'm gonna sing it with you   
    so we can get it in time.   

246
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:48,931
       Let's do it again.       

247
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,232
  - This is gonna sound crazy,  

248
00:09:50,234 --> 00:09:52,767
     but what if we go back     
  to your idea you had before?  

249
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,268
           - Of what?           
    - Oh, you want to switch?   

250
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,337
    - Where I do more of the    
  character and you do flirty.  

251
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,304
   - Do you want to try that?   
              Okay.             

252
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,872
             - Yeah.            
             - Okay.            

253
00:09:58,874 --> 00:09:59,973
    - 'Cause that way, if I'm   
  coming right behind somebody, 

254
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,040
       it's easier for me       
          to keep time.         

255
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:02,241
    - And that's a good idea.   
              Okay.             

256
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:03,141
         So I'm gonna--         
     we're gonna switch now.    

257
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:04,575
     - We'll switch it out.     

258
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,711
  - The decision to have Alexis 
  and Jaymes switch characters  

259
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:08,712
     is the right decision.     

260
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:10,080
     We're all thinking it.     

261
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:12,481
      It's gonna be better      
     for everyone concerned.    

262
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,383
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.   

263
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:16,452
      - Jaymes, I'm floozy.     

264
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:20,955
    - We are actually rooting   
           for Jaymes           

265
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:22,289
     and want him to shine,     

266
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,858
       but he's gonna have      
      to believe in himself     

267
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,194
         to really sell         
         this challenge.        

268
00:10:29,197 --> 00:10:32,264
    - One, two, three, four,    
    five, six, seven, eight.    

269
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,898
   - It's time for rehearsal.   

270
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,266
       - One, two, three.       

271
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:38,069
           (cheering)           

272
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,036
         - Ay dios mio!         

273
00:10:40,038 --> 00:10:43,406
   My Coo-Coo is just shaking   
           right now.           

274
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,240
       - All right, guys.       
            I'm Dom.            

275
00:10:46,242 --> 00:10:48,208
         I'm a two-time         
  world cheerleading champion,  

276
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,844
 and I'm here to teach you guys 
  a competitive cheer routine.  

277
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,045
          - All right.          

278
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,113
      - It's gonna consist      
        of some tumbling,       

279
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:55,882
   some jumping, some stunts.   

280
00:10:55,884 --> 00:10:57,283
           We're gonna          
     have to work together,     

281
00:10:57,285 --> 00:10:58,917
   but you're also gonna have   
    to learn how to stand out   

282
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,051
        at the same time.       

283
00:11:00,053 --> 00:11:01,352
      We're gonna start it      
         with stunting.         

284
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,888
        - I am so pissed.       

285
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,056
      I don't know who even     
    does cartwheels anymore.    

286
00:11:07,058 --> 00:11:08,391
   It's not even the eighties.  

287
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:11,827
  - So what you're going to do  
       is dip down on one,      

288
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,862
            stand up,           
       lock out your legs,      

289
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,998
   squeeze your tush and hold.  

290
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,966
         - Oh, my gosh.         

291
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,000
   - Five, six, seven, eight.   

292
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,769
     One and three, dip one,    
          straight leg.         

293
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,104
             - Ooh!             
             - Wow!             

294
00:11:23,106 --> 00:11:24,671
          - Oh, my God!         

295
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:30,376
      I cannot believe what     
    they are asking us to do.   

296
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:31,977
     - Dip one, then three.     

297
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,579
              - Oh!             

298
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:34,713
        - Okay, make sure       
     when you go back down,     

299
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:36,080
            you reach           
      for their shoulders.      

300
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:39,217
   - There's gonna be a severe  
     injury on this episode.    

301
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,318
       - Valentina, ready?      

302
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,386
       Dip one, up, three.      

303
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:43,686
   - I was literally shaking,   

304
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:47,090
but I said to myself, Valentina,
      when in doubt, smile.     

305
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,160
     - One, two, down three.    

306
00:11:52,162 --> 00:11:54,529
     Okay. Can we switch out    
         the fliers now?        

307
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,630
             Ready.             
  And five, six, seven, eight.  

308
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,532
     Dip one, straight legs.    

309
00:11:58,534 --> 00:11:59,533
              - Oh!             

310
00:11:59,535 --> 00:12:02,102
             Bitch,             
     I'm scared of heights.     

311
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:05,972
           Oh, my God!          
     This is scary as fuck!     

312
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:08,607
      If I fall, it's gonna     
        fuck up my face.        

313
00:12:08,609 --> 00:12:09,608
         - Then, three.         
              - Oh!             

314
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,076
            - My face           
     is definitely expensive    

315
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,178
        and I don't want        
        to mess that up.        

316
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,247
           No, ma'am.           
     Oh, that's not for me.     

317
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:21,484
  - We are feeling the pressure 
          and the burn.         

318
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:24,052
        Although the burn       
    might be something else.    

319
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:25,520
              - Oh.             

320
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,088
          - All right.          

321
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,055
             - Yes.             

322
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,256
  - We're back in the workroom  

323
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,658
    and we're all frantically   
         doing our part         

324
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,259
     to get our looks ready     
   for our cheer competition.   

325
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:35,560
        We have our work        
         cut out for us.        

326
00:12:35,562 --> 00:12:36,894
      - We all have to look     
            amazing.            

327
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,262
    - I don't have bloomers.    

328
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,603
    - I'm gonna wear tights.    

329
00:12:47,605 --> 00:12:49,437
      - Yeah, but you still     
    have to have panties on.    

330
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:51,373
      - No, I'm not wearing     
      anything underneath.      

331
00:12:52,908 --> 00:12:53,907
             - What?            

332
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:54,975
    - So if you go like this,   

333
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:57,276
       it just looks like       
         Barbie crotch?         

334
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,477
    - Why am I being attacked   
        of being a woman?       

335
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,380
- Women wear bloomers underneath
   their cheerleading clothes.  

336
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:04,415
     - Not the slutty ones.     

337
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,984
           (all laugh)          
    Fine, I'll wear panties.    

338
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,352
           - (laughs)           

339
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,553
 - RuPaul Glamazons, we're gonna
     teach you how to stunt     

340
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,488
   so we can do some pyramids.  

341
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,057
      Ready, and five, six,     
          seven, eight.         

342
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,892
     Dip one, two and three.    

343
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,995
- Should the inside of the palms
          be together?          

344
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:21,296
     - As close as you can.     
             - Okay.            

345
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:22,930
   - Don't think about looking  
        straight forward.       

346
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:25,432
   Turn your head to the side.  
  You're gonna get a face full. 

347
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,734
     - That's not a problem.    
           (all laugh)          

348
00:13:27,736 --> 00:13:29,168
     - You think you got it?    

349
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,803
            - (sighs)           

350
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:33,673
     I'm thinking to myself,    
   it's probably not the sport  

351
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:36,508
           for people           
    with an AARP membership.    

352
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,911
     - And dip one in three.    

353
00:13:38,913 --> 00:13:40,012
      Good. Straight arms.      

354
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,279
    Try and lift those knees    
        up to your chest.       

355
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:43,481
  And five, six, seven, eight.  

356
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,082
      Dip one, two, three.      

357
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:46,983
       How are we feeling?      

358
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:48,918
           - Fabulous.          
           (all laugh)          

359
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,620
        We're gonna need        
         stunt doubles.         

360
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,458
- You guys, I can't even believe
     I'm still stoning this.    

361
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,059
          Like, this is         
        hard labor work.        

362
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:01,195
           This is why          
    I pay people to do this.    

363
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:02,996
      - Stoning really does     
          feed my soul.         

364
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:04,230
       - It does me, too.       

365
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:05,931
      I love to put sparkle     
         on everything.         

366
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,699
            - I think           
    when you stone anything,    

367
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:09,200
       it's just an excuse      
          to look great         

368
00:14:09,202 --> 00:14:11,636
         without really         
        even being great.       

369
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:13,204
   Stoning is for ugly girls.   

370
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:17,340
       Don't get me wrong,      
     but I think all of us,     

371
00:14:17,342 --> 00:14:18,875
       we kind of grew up       
     differently, you know.     

372
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,810
    Like, some of us love to,   
      like, create things.      

373
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:22,244
       - Well, some of us       
         don't love it.         

374
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:24,646
   Some of us have to do this   
           to survive.          

375
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:27,148
         Sewing all day         
       makes my back hurt,      

376
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,817
      and I eventually get      
     so creatively exhausted    

377
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:32,952
       that I just despise      
  looking at my crafting room.  

378
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,787
         But I know that        
     if I don't go in there,    

379
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:37,489
 I'm not gonna be able to go to 
the buffet that I want to later.

380
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:39,324
           (all laugh)          

381
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:41,259
     - Sister, I'll take you    
     to the buffet with me.     

382
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:42,659
         - Well, bitch,         
     you take me to a buffet    

383
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:43,893
   and I'll sew you something.  

384
00:14:43,895 --> 00:14:45,394
    - So can you finish this    
          for me then?          

385
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,998
      - Kimora is gorgeous,     
      but that attitude...      

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,699
      - I'm getting tired,      
       I'm getting thirsty      

387
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:54,634
     and I'm getting, like,     
       anxiety right now.       

388
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,201
        - Not cute, girl.       

389
00:14:57,203 --> 00:14:58,869
              - Oh!             

390
00:14:58,871 --> 00:15:00,570
         - Coming up...         
             - Wait!            

391
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,204
        - Uh, this is my        
      virgin de Guadalupe.      

392
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:04,940
 I've really been praying to her
       every single night.      

393
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,909
       - You crazy, bitch.      

394
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:11,612
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)  

395
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,881
         (RuPaul laughs)        

396
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,617
             - Yay!             
             - Yeah.            

397
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,285
       - Day two, whores.       

398
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:24,622
   - Glamazons are gonna kick   
        the B-52s asses.        

399
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,457
      - So today is the day     

400
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,891
     we're about to perform     

401
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,661
       this mother fucking      
        cheer challenge.        

402
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,532
          - Wait! Girl!         

403
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,033
         Do you really?         

404
00:15:37,035 --> 00:15:38,767
        - Oh, this is my        
      virgin de Guadalupe.      

405
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:40,002
   I wish I could turn her on,  

406
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:42,904
but I really been praying to her
       every single night       

407
00:15:42,906 --> 00:15:44,238
      just to watch over me     

408
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,939
          and guide me          
      through this process.     

409
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:47,340
         - Who, Madonna?        

410
00:15:47,342 --> 00:15:49,542
              - No,             
     la virgin de Guadalupe.    

411
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:53,310
       - You crazy, bitch.      

412
00:15:53,312 --> 00:15:55,312
     That's some crazy shit.    

413
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,114
           - Everybody          
    gets to have a drag mom,    

414
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:59,315
         but I feel like        
     la virgin de Guadalupe     

415
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,315
         is my drag mom.        

416
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,850
     She helped get me here.    

417
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:03,752
           She's gonna          
        help me win, too.       

418
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,087
      (praying in Spanish)      

419
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:07,655
       Please help me win       
         this challenge.        

420
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:08,989
         I need to win.         

421
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:10,890
      Love you, thank you.      

422
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:12,824
          - Did you do          
       high school sports?      

423
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:17,028
   - I played tennis and then   
   I did swimming and diving.   

424
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,929
     And I think the diving     

425
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,497
      kind of helped me out     
     with this a little bit.    

426
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:23,132
       - Yeah. Girl, I did      
    high school cheerleading.   

427
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:24,267
             - Yes.             
       - We never did no--      

428
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,801
          Girl, it was          
      a black high school.      

429
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,269
      We, like, you know...     

430
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:29,671
        - Right. (laughs)       

431
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:35,976
       - I'll never forget      
        I was in the gym        

432
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:37,544
   with all the cheerleaders.   

433
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,379
  Some of the girls were like,  
      oh, what do you think     

434
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,147
  about that basketball player  
           over there?          

435
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,650
         He was so fine.        

436
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:45,817
            - Boing.            

437
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:49,187
        - Like, gorgeous        
           cocoa skin.          

438
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,788
         And I was like,        
    oh, he's cute, he's cute.   

439
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,790
     And later on, at lunch,    

440
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,191
I see the entire basketball team
          looking at me         

441
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:57,427
    like I'm about to get it.   

442
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:00,262
    So I get up and I'm like,   
  let me get out of here early. 

443
00:17:00,264 --> 00:17:01,563
          I'm by myself         
        in the stairwell,       

444
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:07,502
 and the entire basketball team 
       comes up the steps,      

445
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,103
       and one of the boys      
    beats the hell out of me.   

446
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:11,305
            - (gasps)           
           - No, Pep.           

447
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:12,306
          - It's true.          

448
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:16,542
      But afterwards, I was     
    talking to the secretary,   

449
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:17,710
     told her what happened.    

450
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:18,977
        And you know how        
     the high school offices    

451
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:20,278
           have, like,          
       all glass windows.       

452
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,346
            - Uh-huh.           

453
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:23,615
      - So I turned around,     
          and I swear,          

454
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,851
        the entire school       
         was just there.        

455
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:28,953
          It felt like          
        a circle of love.       

456
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:31,455
    Like, people were crying,   
   my friends were out there.   

457
00:17:31,457 --> 00:17:33,491
     So I felt pretty good,     
            you know.           

458
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:34,958
      And he got expelled.      
           - Right on.          

459
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,793
       - I stayed captain       
   of the cheerleading squad.   

460
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:37,860
           - Come on.           

461
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:39,561
  - When I was in high school,  

462
00:17:39,563 --> 00:17:42,464
        I was singled out       
      for being different.      

463
00:17:42,466 --> 00:17:43,798
      After that incident,      

464
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,933
         I had strangers        
       reaching out to me,      

465
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:48,468
      and I knew right away     

466
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,272
        that I was loved,       
      and that felt great.      

467
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,841
      - Cynthia, your story     
        really touched me       

468
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:00,411
      because I have a lot      
     of people in my family     

469
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,146
      who have had cancer,      
    and, like, and who have--   

470
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,814
         who have passed        
        because of that.        

471
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,482
          - Oh, my God.         
  - I just wanted to make sure  

472
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,183
    that you're okay, because   
      I know your struggle      

473
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:11,152
  which was hard, and it really 
        touched my heart.       

474
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:13,454
          - Thank you.          
           Girl, whoo!          

475
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:14,588
        It's a challenge.       

476
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,424
   Everything was a real mess.  

477
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:21,061
     I get my results and it    
   was liver cancer stage one.  

478
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:23,396
      So I was like, what?      

479
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:26,565
   You know, I mean, I just...  

480
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:29,301
     I was living my dream,     

481
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:32,904
     and now I need to face,    
       like, liver cancer.      

482
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:38,041
           I was sad.           

483
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:40,343
        I was really sad.       

484
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:43,179
     It's hard when you know    
     that you have a disease    

485
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:45,213
       and maybe probably       
       could be, you know,      

486
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:46,714
   the last days of your life.  

487
00:18:46,716 --> 00:18:49,083
             I mean,            
  the immune system goes down.  

488
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,384
         So even a cold,        

489
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:52,885
     it can possibly, like,     
     kill you, so, I mean--     

490
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:58,090
     - It's unreal to think     
       that you could die.      

491
00:18:58,092 --> 00:18:59,825
        - At any moment.        
          - Any moment.         

492
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,393
     - But let me tell you.     
        I'm in remission.       

493
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:08,332
    - Cynthia is living proof   
   that cancer is not the end.  

494
00:19:08,334 --> 00:19:09,800
       - Whoo! Group hug.       
      We need a group hug.      

495
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:13,203
         - If anything,         
  she's stronger competing now. 

496
00:19:13,205 --> 00:19:16,572
    It has given her a drive    
       to really succeed,       

497
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:19,675
       and she's doing it       
           with beauty          

498
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:21,243
   and with a sense of humor,   

499
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,144
   and that's a drag we need.   

500
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:25,513
  - #KickingCancerintheCooCoo.  

501
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,181
           (cheering)           

502
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,826
         (RuPaul laughs)        

503
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:47,266
         -  Cover girl,        
   put the bass in your walk   

504
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:51,235
          Head to toe,         
   let your whole body talk    

505
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,704
            And what?           

506
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:57,474
   - Welcome to the main stage  
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

507
00:19:57,476 --> 00:20:00,477
      My head cheerleader,      
        Michelle Visage.        

508
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,577
        How's your head?        

509
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:03,312
          - Haven't had         
         any complaints.        

510
00:20:03,314 --> 00:20:04,579
           - (laughs)           

511
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:09,049
And everybody's grooving because
         it's the B-52s.        

512
00:20:09,051 --> 00:20:12,185
      Hey, is your tin roof     
          still rusted?         

513
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:13,520
          - Ooh, yeah.          
           - Oh, yeah.          

514
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:15,621
          - Yeah, baby.         

515
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,322
          - This week,          
    our queens are competing    

516
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:20,859
     in the biggest, baddest    
       cheer battle ever.       

517
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:24,529
       Let's check in with      
   our very own Ross Mathews.   

518
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:26,664
           - Yes, Ru,           
      this is so exciting!      

519
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,999
         It smells like         
          queen spirit.         

520
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:31,434
          I'm actually          
       literally gagging.       

521
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:33,369
          Back to you.          

522
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:35,737
         - Thanks, Ross.        
       We'll be watching.       

523
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,006
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines,      

524
00:20:38,008 --> 00:20:40,641
   and may the best woman win.  

525
00:20:40,643 --> 00:20:41,876
          Coming up...          

526
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:47,179
             - Whoo!            
              - Ow!             

527
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:48,747
          (bell dings)          

528
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,149
         (RuPaul laughs)        

529
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,418
      - It's the "RuPaul's      
           Drag Race"           

530
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,220
   Cheer Battle Extravaganza!   

531
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:01,324
       RuPaul's Glamazons       
    versus the B-52 Bombers.    

532
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,093
           - Ru call.           

533
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,761
      - I'm Aja, I'm sassy.     

534
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,629
      - I'm Nina, I'm assy.     

535
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,397
     - I'm Shea, I'm flirty.    

536
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:11,031
     - I'm Sasha, I'm dirty.    

537
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:12,699
    - I'm Charlie, I'm boozy.   

538
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:14,568
    - I'm Jaymes, I'm snoozy.   

539
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,503
          - I'm Alexis          
        and I'm a floozy.       

540
00:21:17,505 --> 00:21:19,405
      All: We are RuPaul's      
           Glamazons.           

541
00:21:19,407 --> 00:21:21,473
   Got our tucking panties on.  

542
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:23,207
    Our beat is unstoppable.    

543
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,875
    Our wigs are unclockable.   

544
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:28,345
    All: All right, work it,    
       work it, all right.      

545
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:31,415
    - B-52 Bombers, let's go!   

546
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,216
   - I'm Coo-Coo, I'm naughty.  

547
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,018
    - I'm Kimora, I'm slutty.   

548
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,852
    - I'm Eureka, I'm wacky.    

549
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:38,353
    - I'm Trinity, I'm tacky.   

550
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:40,021
    - I'm Farrah, I'm thorny.   

551
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,889
        - I'm Peppermint,       
           I'm corny.           

552
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:44,558
        - I'm Valentina,        
         I'm also corny.        

553
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,393
           (all laugh)          

554
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:48,127
        All: Our lobsters       
          are rocking.          

555
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,695
    Our love is in the shack.   

556
00:21:49,697 --> 00:21:51,330
          We're roaming         
        'cause we wanna,        

557
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:52,998
      so haters step back.      

558
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,698
         ALL: B-50-who?         

559
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,266
       Not as cool as Ru.       

560
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:59,034
      RuPaul is more fierce     
    than Kate could ever be.    

561
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:02,504
      More woman than Fred      
    and more man than Cindy.    

562
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,106
    All: RuPaul is shameless,   
  selling candy bars and more.  

563
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,907
             - Ugh!             
   All: She even had a perfume  

564
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,708
    and it was called Whore.    

565
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,677
           (all laugh)          

566
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,812
   All: Your beehive's busted.  

567
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:15,380
    Your songs are too slow.    

568
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:21,786
      You should go retire      
      in a private Ida-ho.      

569
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,288
         - And it's time        
    for the tumbling package.   

570
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,356
         (whistle blows)        

571
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:38,602
        - Yeah, big girl.       
      Come on, bitch, yes.      

572
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:42,171
           Holy fuck.           

573
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:45,007
             I land             
     and I feel my knee pop.    

574
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,676
   But I knew there was no way  
         I was stopping.        

575
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:48,876
      Bitch, I'm on a roll.     

576
00:22:48,878 --> 00:22:50,377
             - Whoo!            
             - Aah!             

577
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:51,545
   - Now, that was impressive.  

578
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,814
    - Valentina surprised me.   

579
00:22:55,816 --> 00:22:57,382
    I feel a little bit like,   
           oh, my God.          

580
00:22:57,384 --> 00:23:00,518
       I choose her last,       

581
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,520
      but she came to slay.     

582
00:23:09,328 --> 00:23:11,194
       - Ms. Jaymes? Girl.      

583
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:18,234
             - Whoo!            
             - Whoo!            

584
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:22,671
         - There we go.         

585
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:26,974
          (horn blows)          

586
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,143
  - Now the ladies will move on 
       to the group dance.      

587
00:23:42,924 --> 00:23:44,858
             - Whoo!            

588
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:53,265
              Whoo!             

589
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,300
      (cheers and applause)     

590
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,001
   - Five, six, seven, eight.   

591
00:23:57,003 --> 00:24:00,070
      - Glamazons, Bombers,     
      the battle raging on.     

592
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,805
     This cheer ain't over.     

593
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,308
        Now bring it on!        

594
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,379
    - When I get all the way    
         up to the top,         

595
00:24:10,381 --> 00:24:12,814
        I feel like, yes,       
       I'm a cheerleader.       

596
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:13,982
              - Oh!             

597
00:24:19,055 --> 00:24:21,956
             - Whoo!            
      (cheers and applause)     

598
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,124
 - The judges are going to have 
 a tough time scoring this one. 

599
00:24:24,126 --> 00:24:25,525
      I feel bad for them.      

600
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,593
            Oh, wait.           
        I'm a judge. Uh.        

601
00:24:27,595 --> 00:24:32,130
        - The category is       
      white party realness.     

602
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:34,131
       Nina Bo'nina Brown       
           Zeta Jones.          

603
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,934
    - Glamazon Shazaam-a-zon.   

604
00:24:36,936 --> 00:24:40,370
   - When Nina Bo'nina Banana   
      Osama bin Laden Brown     

605
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:43,106
     hits the runway, child,    
        I'm a bad bitch.        

606
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,106
   - Hungry, hungry hip pads.   

607
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,407
             - Ooh.             

608
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:48,142
       - Alexis Michelle.       

609
00:24:48,144 --> 00:24:50,444
       - Do these earrings      
      make my ass look fat?     

610
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:51,845
     - I'm serving glamour,     

611
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:54,547
    but I've got it turned on   
   its ear just a little bit.   

612
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:55,647
       - Tin roof frosted.      

613
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:58,116
           (all laugh)          

614
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,185
          Shea Coulee.          

615
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:02,119
         - I'll have two        
     vanilla cones, please.     

616
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:07,490
   - I'm serving you chocolate  
     sixties bodacious babe.    

617
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:09,559
         - Remember when        
   we used to do white lines?   

618
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:11,828
             - Whoo!            
           - (laughs)           

619
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,896
        - Charlie Hides.        

620
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:16,465
       - Very Linda Evans       
         from "Dynasty."        

621
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:17,766
    - The outfit is amazing.    

622
00:25:17,768 --> 00:25:20,702
      I look like a fashion     
 illustration of the Snow Queen.

623
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:23,337
           - You know,          
      she's from the hood.      

624
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,971
         - Sasha Velour.        

625
00:25:24,973 --> 00:25:28,241
     - I've taken a classic     
    silhouette and updated it   

626
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:32,144
  with a commitment to showing  
      women who are strong.     

627
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:33,913
 - You know what they say about 
   girls who wear white pumps.  

628
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:34,913
         - True hooker.         

629
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:37,215
            - Mm-hmm.           

630
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:38,616
             - Aja.             

631
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:40,718
     - Where's my fava beans    
          and chianti?          

632
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,255
       - I believe that's       
  a whitening strip, actually.  

633
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:46,056
       - I'm an Illuminati      
            princess.           

634
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:48,224
    They tried to silence me,   
    and I'm like, no, bitch,    

635
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:49,325
      I'm still gonna talk.     

636
00:25:49,327 --> 00:25:51,426
     - Now you Khali-see me,    
         now you don't.         

637
00:25:51,428 --> 00:25:52,594
             - Hmm.             

638
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:54,863
       - Jaymes Mansfield.      

639
00:25:54,865 --> 00:25:56,864
       - Gentlemen prefer       
          a white muff.         

640
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:59,300
        - My look is fun.       
           It's campy.          

641
00:25:59,302 --> 00:26:01,634
        I look fabulous.        

642
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,535
    - The girl can't help it.   

643
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:06,971
     - Oh, I'm sure she can.    

644
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:09,107
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.    

645
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,676
   - Oh, my goodness, I think   
      I'm having a dj Ru.     

646
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:13,176
         - I'm going to         
       the most expensive       

647
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:16,412
     white party ever, okay?    

648
00:26:16,414 --> 00:26:18,447
       - My fair Coo-Coo.       

649
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:19,781
           - (laughs)           

650
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:21,515
         - Farrah Moan.         

651
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:22,916
    - I like the peek-a-boos.   

652
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:24,751
        - I'm giving you        
      a little bit of ass,      

653
00:26:24,753 --> 00:26:28,287
      a little bit of class     
     and some broken glass.     

654
00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:30,055
   - She is quite the hipster.  

655
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:32,190
           Valentina.           

656
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,158
              - Oh.             

657
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,559
           - Nice day           
      for a white wedding.      

658
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:39,129
    - I'm inspired by my mom    
    and dad's wedding video.    

659
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:42,265
     My mom was known as the    
beautiful bride in her hometown,

660
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,133
           and I want           
     to tell you that story.    

661
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,435
- If anybody has any objections,
        shut the fuck up.       

662
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:48,336
        - Yeah. (laughs)        

663
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:50,337
         Trinity Taylor.        

664
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,140
     - I think a UFO landed.    

665
00:26:53,142 --> 00:26:55,374
   - My ass looks really good   
      in these white pants.     

666
00:26:55,376 --> 00:26:58,210
  They look like two snowballs  
         just juggling.         

667
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,811
  - I hear she comes in piece.  

668
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:02,581
           (all laugh)          

669
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,215
         - Kimora Blac.         

670
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:06,483
          - Now that's          
     my kind of patriotism.     

671
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:07,984
  - I'm going to a white party  
            on a boat           

672
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:11,220
        with hot sailors,       
    and we're gonna have fun.   

673
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:13,256
  - I don't think she'll sink,  
             do you?            

674
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:16,692
        - She comes with        
    her own flotation device.   

675
00:27:16,694 --> 00:27:20,462
           Peppermint.          
        Ooh, winter mint.       

676
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:23,130
          - I've chosen         
    an Elvis Presley-inspired   

677
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:25,833
   rock 'n' roll extravaganza.  

678
00:27:25,835 --> 00:27:29,369
      - That pearl necklace     
      seems to be dripping.     

679
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,938
            - Eureka.           

680
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,573
    Honey, it's milking time.   
            - Uh-huh.           

681
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:35,808
    - I'm giving you glamour,   

682
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,244
    androgynous Glamazonian,    
         big tuna fish.         

683
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:41,212
            - Eureka,           
    like the vacuum cleaner?    

684
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:43,347
    - Yes, and she can suck.    

685
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:46,483
 - Maybe I won't have my mother 
        watch this show.        

686
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:48,819
           (all laugh)          

687
00:27:48,821 --> 00:27:49,886
         - Coming up...         

688
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,055
   - You were so fun to watch.  

689
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,924
      - Space age fashion,      
           I adore it.          

690
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:56,124
  - You're like a drug dealer.  
     Gave me a little dose.     

691
00:27:56,126 --> 00:27:57,926
         I wanted more.         
           (all laugh)          

692
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,861
   (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)  

693
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,696
         (RuPaul laughs)        

694
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:05,564
       - Welcome, ladies.       

695
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:07,565
            This week           
     you competed as teams,     

696
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,201
      but you'll be judged      
         as individuals.        

697
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:15,105
     When I call your name,     
      please step forward.      

698
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:16,940
       Nina Bo'nina Brown.      

699
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:19,208
        Alexis Michelle.        

700
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,044
          Sasha Velour.         

701
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:23,311
              Aja.              

702
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,913
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.     

703
00:28:25,915 --> 00:28:27,915
          Farrah Moan.          

704
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:30,116
           Peppermint.          

705
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:32,518
             Eureka.            

706
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,152
      Ladies, you are safe.     

707
00:28:34,154 --> 00:28:35,620
           - (exhales)          

708
00:28:35,622 --> 00:28:36,621
          - Thank you.          

709
00:28:36,623 --> 00:28:38,256
   - You may leave the stage.   

710
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:45,162
            It's time           
  for the judges' critiques...  

711
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:48,464
   Starting with Shea Coulee.   

712
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:52,166
  - Tonight, you are giving me  
      this futuristic look      

713
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:54,702
  with hair that hearkens back  
         to Barbarella,         

714
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:56,336
   and I'm really feeling it.   

715
00:28:56,338 --> 00:28:58,871
   - And the routine you did,   
       you were fantastic.      

716
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:01,574
  - She did some amazing flips, 
    and I made note of that.    

717
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,475
         - You could see        
      the humor there, too.     

718
00:29:03,477 --> 00:29:06,611
   - As a kid, I wanted to be   
  like Dominique Dawes so bad,  

719
00:29:06,613 --> 00:29:10,247
  but my parents were like, uh, 
you can do that in the backyard.

720
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,881
      We ain't putting you      
         in no lessons.         

721
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,483
           (all laugh)          
    - Thank you, Shea Coulee.   

722
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,320
     Next up, Charlie Hides.    

723
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:20,789
     - I didn't remember you    
    from the acrobatic thing.   

724
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:24,526
   - I tried to star everyone   
that I really thought stood out.

725
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:26,560
   - Did Charlie have a star?   
              - No.             

726
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:29,530
    - But I'll tell you this,   
  you seized me on the runway.  

727
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:32,365
   This look is just so good.   

728
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,699
          - Thank you.          

729
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:36,702
           - Up next,           
        Jaymes Mansfield.       

730
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:37,870
              - Hi.             

731
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:41,039
        - The way you pad       
          is glorious.          

732
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,741
     You're giving me, like,    
       saddlebag and hips.      

733
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,108
            It's hot.           
        But in the cheer,       

734
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,279
      I don't remember you,     
      and that's not good.      

735
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:54,317
  I think you like to consider  
    yourself a comedy queen,    

736
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,819
  but I haven't found anything  
     funny coming from you.     

737
00:29:58,055 --> 00:30:01,288
           I feel that          
   you're unsure of yourself.   

738
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,823
     You have to believe it     
      in order to sell us.      

739
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,291
            - You do            
      this airhead shtick,      

740
00:30:05,293 --> 00:30:07,626
  and I think if you committed  
   all the say, it'd be great.  

741
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:09,428
     And I think that's what    
     Michelle's getting at,     

742
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,363
        is the confidence       
         to commit 100%,        

743
00:30:11,365 --> 00:30:14,132
         and I feel like        
          it's at 20%.          

744
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:17,768
      - Next up, Valentina.     

745
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,705
         - I loved this         
      virginal Latina bride     

746
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:23,507
      down to the crossing      
          of yourself.          

747
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:24,942
      It was also beautiful     

748
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:28,711
  all the way down to the nude  
       and not white shoe.      

749
00:30:28,713 --> 00:30:29,845
   But we won't bring that up.  

750
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:31,246
           (all laugh)          

751
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:34,448
     Now, the cheerleading,     
      what I loved the most     

752
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,416
       was that even when       
     the lights weren't on,     

753
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,918
   I was watching you, and you  
    were fully in character.    

754
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,887
     And it just--it was so,    
       like, "SNL" moment.      

755
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:43,821
        - I found myself        
        looking for you.        

756
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:44,955
   You're like a drug dealer.   
   You gave me a little dose.   

757
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,456
         I wanted more.         
           (all laugh)          

758
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,825
    Keep it up, or as you say   
          in Spanish--          

759
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:51,194
     I don't know how you--     
  I don't know how to say that. 

760
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,495
           (all laugh)          

761
00:30:52,497 --> 00:30:54,664
   - Next up, Trinity Taylor.   

762
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,631
            - You had           
     the toughest job of all    

763
00:30:56,633 --> 00:31:00,735
     as the ultimate flier,     
  and you were so fun to watch. 

764
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,970
          - And I think         
    this outfit's fantastic.    

765
00:31:02,972 --> 00:31:04,872
         Beyond Mugler.         
          - Thank you.          

766
00:31:04,874 --> 00:31:07,808
     - Up next, Kimora Blac.    

767
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,278
     - What stood out to me     
     was the wig you had on,    

768
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,114
 but you didn't really stand out
          athletically.         

769
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:15,381
     - And that's not good.     

770
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:18,684
  - Tonight, probably my least  
     favorite on the runway.    

771
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:19,751
       If I looked at you,      

772
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,352
     I'd automatically think    
         nautical theme.        

773
00:31:21,354 --> 00:31:23,486
  I wish the gloves were white  
     and the bra was white.     

774
00:31:23,488 --> 00:31:24,653
      I know it sounds like     
      it's a lot of white,      

775
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:27,256
     but it's a white party.    

776
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:30,692
      - Thank you, ladies.      
   I think we've heard enough.  

777
00:31:30,694 --> 00:31:34,229
   While you untuck backstage,  

778
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:36,397
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

779
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,433
     All right, just between    
      us squirrel friends,      

780
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:41,501
       what do you think,       

781
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:44,136
   starting with Shea Coulee?   

782
00:31:44,138 --> 00:31:48,373
  - I thought she was the best  
   in the athletic department,  

783
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,274
          and I thought         
    she looked great tonight.   

784
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:51,841
       I love that outfit.      

785
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:54,109
   - In terms of star quality,  
           she has it.          

786
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:56,746
      But I think she needs     
  to have some kind of padding. 

787
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,548
        She's got thighs,       
   but she ain't got no booty.  

788
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,384
   - All right. Let's move on   
        to Charlie Hides.       

789
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,885
  - In the cheerleading thing,  

790
00:32:03,887 --> 00:32:05,953
  she had this great character  
            of Boozy.           

791
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:09,656
 You, out of everybody, Charlie,
 could've taken it all the way. 

792
00:32:09,658 --> 00:32:11,925
          - But Charlie         
        looked beautiful,       

793
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:14,093
 certainly carried herself well 
         on the runway.         

794
00:32:14,095 --> 00:32:17,262
   - I'm eager to see what she  
 pulls out of her suitcase next,

795
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:18,897
       but she better pull      
      personality out, too.     

796
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:21,265
       - Jaymes Mansfield.      

797
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,767
    - Listen, you got a name    
     like Jaymes Mansfield,     

798
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:25,368
       you better deliver.      

799
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,469
        - I used to watch       
        "The Match Game,"       

800
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:30,872
    and Jayne Mansfield would   
     come on every so often     

801
00:32:30,874 --> 00:32:32,841
        and had a wiggle        
          in her walk.          

802
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:35,510
     Jaymes needs more voom     
         in his vah-vah.        

803
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:39,146
 - She wants to portray herself 
   as this comedic character,   

804
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:40,313
       when I don't think       

805
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:42,816
        that character's        
    completely realized yet.    

806
00:32:42,818 --> 00:32:46,819
     - Jaymes' audition tape    
     was so funny, I got it.    

807
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:49,154
    I understood the shtick.    

808
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,556
  But I think that since she's  
    been in this competition    

809
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:53,023
      with the other girls,     
        she's thrown off.       

810
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:54,091
             - Yeah.            

811
00:32:54,093 --> 00:32:55,325
          - Valentina.          

812
00:32:55,327 --> 00:32:57,493
      - Valentina, rrrrrrr.     

813
00:32:57,495 --> 00:32:58,593
           (all laugh)          

814
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,995
        As a cheerleader,       
      she really stood out      

815
00:33:00,997 --> 00:33:02,563
  with her facial expressions.  

816
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:03,964
        She just made you       
           notice her.          

817
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:07,033
     - And I thought she was    
    the best dressed tonight.   

818
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:08,368
   I thought she was stunning.  

819
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,636
  - Michelle, you did clock her 
       on her nude shoes.       

820
00:33:10,638 --> 00:33:12,805
          - I'm sorry,          
  I just couldn't let that go,  

821
00:33:12,807 --> 00:33:15,340
         because she was        
    so flawless head to toe,    

822
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:17,541
      why wouldn't she put      
        a white shoe on?        

823
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,009
       Why would she throw      
         a nude clunker?        

824
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:21,277
 - Well, maybe she was thinking 
  something old, something new, 

825
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,879
       something borrowed,      
         something nude.        

826
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:25,514
           (all laugh)          

827
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:26,948
       - Someone you blew.      

828
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,983
           (all laugh)          

829
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,884
        - Trinity Taylor.       

830
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,552
           - I thought          
    it was really impressive    

831
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,620
       how both characters      
   were completely different.   

832
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:36,254
           I wouldn't           
      have recognized her.      

833
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,023
- Tonight on the runway, though,
   it wasn't my favorite thing  

834
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:40,658
    'cause we've kind of seen   
  a lot of this over the years. 

835
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,059
           - I thought          
      it was very original.     

836
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,962
      - Space age fashion,      
   I mean, that's total B-52.   

837
00:33:45,964 --> 00:33:47,197
           I adore it.          

838
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,931
         - Kimora Blac.         

839
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:51,466
     - I didn't remember her    
      from the competition,     

840
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:54,369
         and that wasn't        
       my favorite outfit.      

841
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:55,470
           - I thought          
        she was a newbie.       

842
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:56,704
      - I know why you got      
        that impression,        

843
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:59,540
       because she paired       
     so many different looks    

844
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:01,776
       onto that one look.      
            - Right.            

845
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:05,679
     - Where someone who's a    
seasoned prostitute would have--

846
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:08,849
     would have just chosen     
        the nautical hat.       

847
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:13,753
    It actually accented her    
   inability to tell a story.   

848
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,220
       - She's got so much      
         going for her,         

849
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:18,657
  the look, the face, the body, 
    the confidence on stage.    

850
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,893
   But in terms of who are you  
         as a performer,        

851
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,728
          I don't know,         
   but I know I want to know.   

852
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,130
      - All right. Silence!     

853
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:29,033
     I've made my decision.     

854
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:32,102
      Bring back my girls.      

855
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,071
   (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)  

856
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,839
         (RuPaul laughs)        

857
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:39,173
     - Welcome back, ladies.    

858
00:34:39,175 --> 00:34:41,676
    I've made some decisions.   

859
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:46,479
          Shea Coulee.          

860
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:47,780
          You're safe.          

861
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:48,915
          - Thank you.          

862
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:52,450
       - Jaymes Mansfield.      

863
00:34:52,452 --> 00:34:56,488
   On the runway, you gave us   
        bombshell floozy,       

864
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:00,191
     but your cheer routine     
    was a little too snoozy.    

865
00:35:02,027 --> 00:35:04,561
     I'm sorry, my dear, but    
   you're up for elimination.   

866
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:06,996
       - It's frustrating.      

867
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:11,266
     What I'm trying to show    
  the judges isn't translating, 

868
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:14,135
     and I don't really know    
  what else they want from me.  

869
00:35:14,137 --> 00:35:15,737
        - Trinity Taylor.       

870
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:18,705
          You're safe.          

871
00:35:18,707 --> 00:35:20,073
          - Thank you.          

872
00:35:22,276 --> 00:35:23,275
          - Valentina.          

873
00:35:23,277 --> 00:35:25,343
     Your cheer engaged us,     

874
00:35:25,345 --> 00:35:29,547
     and your bridal runway     
      made me say, "I do."      

875
00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:31,782
         Sissy-boom-bah,        

876
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,184
        you're the winner       
    of this week's challenge.   

877
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:39,255
You've won a custom wig wardrobe
      from Rock Star Wigs.      

878
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:40,756
      - Thank you so much.      

879
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:41,890
         - You may join         
        the other girls.        

880
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:46,360
         Charlie Hides.         
    You scored on the runway,   

881
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:50,898
     but your cheer routine     
  did not meet our squad goals. 

882
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,235
   Kimora Blac, in the cheer,   
        you disappeared.        

883
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:59,439
   And in white, you got read   
       for being too blue.      

884
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:00,973
        Charlie Hides...        

885
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,242
          You're safe.          

886
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,911
     - Thank you very much.     

887
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:14,083
    - Kimora Blac, I'm sorry,   
            my dear,            

888
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,585
         but you are up         
        for elimination.        

889
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:21,389
   Two queens stand before me.  

890
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:22,923
        Prior to tonight,       

891
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:26,793
    you were asked to prepare   
     a lip sync performance     

892
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:30,864
         of "Love Shack"        
          by the B-52s.         

893
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:34,834
Ladies, this is your last chance
          to impress me         

894
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:38,804
        and save yourself       
        from elimination.       

895
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,806
      The time has come...      
            (thunder)           

896
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:47,177
     To lip sync for your...    

897
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,680
          (echo) life!          

898
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:53,949
       - It really starts       
           to sink in.          

899
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:55,851
       The pressure's on,       
    because I'm performing it   

900
00:36:55,853 --> 00:36:57,886
           in front of          
      the B-52s themselves.     

901
00:36:59,122 --> 00:37:02,923
           - To put me          
    on the bottom two first?    

902
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:04,724
       Jaymes, watch out.       

903
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:06,726
          - Good luck.          

904
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,162
      And don't fuck it up.     

905
00:37:09,164 --> 00:37:11,330
          (music plays)         

906
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:13,231
         -  If you see         
         a faded sign          

907
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,866
    At the side of the road   

908
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,001
       That says 15 miles      
           to the--            

909
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:20,504
        -  Love Shack         

910
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:24,007
       Love Shack, yeah       

911
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:30,013
        I'm headin' down       
      the Atlanta highway      

912
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:35,919
           Lookin' for         
       the love getaway        

913
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,621
             Headed            
     for the love getaway      

914
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,357
       -  I got me a car       
       as big as a whale       

915
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,360
    And we're headin' on down  
       to the Love Shack       

916
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:49,430
      I got me a Chrysler,     
       it seats about 20       

917
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:53,067
      So hurry up and bring    
      your jukebox money       

918
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:56,236
       -  The Love Shack       
     is a little old place     

919
00:37:56,238 --> 00:38:02,242
              Where            
      we can get together      

920
00:38:02,244 --> 00:38:05,678
       Love Shack, baby       

921
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,346
    -  A Love Shack, baby     

922
00:38:07,348 --> 00:38:10,349
         -  Love Shack,        
       baby, Love Shack        

923
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:16,820
       Bang, bang, bang       

924
00:38:16,822 --> 00:38:18,322
       On the door, baby      

925
00:38:20,124 --> 00:38:22,057
     -  I can't hear you      

926
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:23,959
        -  Bang, bang         

927
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:25,393
     -  On the door, baby     

928
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:28,863
        -  Bang, bang         

929
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,097
       -  You're what?        

930
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,565
          - Tin roof...         

931
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,600
             rusted.            

932
00:38:34,602 --> 00:38:37,869
           Love Shack,         
       baby, Love Shack        

933
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:41,539
           Love Shack,         
       baby, Love Shack        

934
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:46,076
    -  Dancing and a-lovin'    
       at the Love Shack       

935
00:38:46,078 --> 00:38:48,745
      (cheers and applause)     

936
00:38:51,348 --> 00:38:54,216
            - Ladies,           
     I've made my decision.     

937
00:38:58,487 --> 00:39:01,822
          Kimora Blac,          
        Shante you stay.        

938
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:07,393
          You may join          
        the other girls.        

939
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,793
           (applause)           

940
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:13,531
        Jaymes Mansfield,       
   we're all rooting for you.   

941
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:16,867
        Now sashay away.        

942
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,735
        - Thank you. Bye.       

943
00:39:18,737 --> 00:39:20,236
           (applause)           

944
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:22,370
        I came in first.        

945
00:39:22,372 --> 00:39:23,471
           (all laugh)          

946
00:39:26,943 --> 00:39:31,178
   Well, that didn't quite go   
  exactly as I hoped it would.  

947
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,882
   I wasn't fully representing  
  myself, and that's my fault.  

948
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:38,451
         But underneath         
    all this glamorous drag,    

949
00:39:38,453 --> 00:39:41,120
    I'm still a human being,    
           so be kind.          

950
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,423
  - Con-drag-ulations, ladies.  

951
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,859
          And remember,         
   if you can't love yourself,  

952
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,760
    how in the hell you gonna   
       love somebody else?      

953
00:39:50,762 --> 00:39:52,495
        Can I get an amen       
           up in here?          

954
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:54,596
           All: Amen!           
          - All right.          

955
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:56,197
     Now let the music play!    

956
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,367
          -  Everyone          
        can be someone         

957
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,001
        If you want to        

958
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:02,936
        I can show you        

959
00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:05,272
          Be someone
