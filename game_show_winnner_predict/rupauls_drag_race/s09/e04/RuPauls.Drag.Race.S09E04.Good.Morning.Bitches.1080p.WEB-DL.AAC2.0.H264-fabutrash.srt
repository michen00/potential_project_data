00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:06,837
  - There's always been tension 
       with me and Eureka.      

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,772
     Maybe she has an issue     
          with the fact         

4
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:10,606
       that every pageant       
       that we've been in,      

5
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,608
           I beat her.          

6
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,510
      - You need to create      
       a totally original       

7
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:19,980
       fairytale princess       
       and sassy sidekick.

00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:21,214
         Trinity Taylor.        

9
00:00:21,216 --> 00:00:22,781
      - This is really fun,     

10
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:24,816
     and then you showed us     
         your starfish.         

11
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:26,751
          - Itch cream.         
         [RuPaul laughs]        

12
00:00:26,753 --> 00:00:27,952
             - Aja.             

13
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:31,922
   - I am Princess Disastah's   
          smoke cloud.          

14
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:35,625
    - I literally had no clue   
   what was going on tonight.   

15
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:39,896
        I also think that       
    your makeup is very dark.   

16
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,130
         - Kimora Blac.         

17
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:46,368
    - My name is Funky Monkey   
      from Banana Kingdom.      

18
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,238
  - Trinity Taylor, you're the  
winner of this week's challenge.

19
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,073
     Aja, shantay, you stay.    

20
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,510
    Kimora Blac, sashay away.   

21
00:01:04,086 --> 00:01:07,154
         - Yes! Finally!        

22
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:10,290
          - Oh, Kimore.         

23
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:14,593
       - Oh, Kimora's gone      
        and I am so sad.        

24
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:17,028
  - How do you feel after that  
  lip sync for your life, baby? 

25
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,564
       - I just feel like       
       I walked into here       

26
00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:21,465
          thinking like         
       I was unstoppable,       

27
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:24,767
       and now I feel like      
  I really need to reevaluate.  

28
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,570
    - For Aja, the challenge    
         is going to be         

29
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:29,505
       not becoming bitter      

30
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,407
    because she sees herself    
         as a superstar.        

31
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:34,442
         And to be told         
       your makeup is off,      

32
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,979
your outfit isn't great is a bit
    of an ego check for her.    

33
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,514
          - So Trinity,         
     last week when you said    

34
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:42,816
      that you were coming      
      for Valentina's spot,     

35
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:45,818
  how does it feel to be coming 
      for Valentina's spot?     

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,919
             -Uh-oh.            
              -Ooh!             

37
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,553
            - Shade.            

38
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:51,022
         - Well, as long        
      as we're being real,      

39
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,257
     I don't think Valentina    
    should've been top three.   

40
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:56,193
          - Valentina,          
    you know I live for you,    

41
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:58,829
       but I think it was       
   a little misjudged tonight.  

42
00:02:00,398 --> 00:02:02,998
   - These girls can continue   
        to talk about me.       

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,666
     They're not the judges.    

44
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:07,435
        I'm ready to be,        
         like, hmm, hmm.        

45
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:09,571
       Whew. I'm focused.       

46
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:12,072
        - Shea, I can't.        

47
00:02:12,074 --> 00:02:13,640
   - Bitch, I wore four items.  

48
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:15,541
         I wore a panty,        
       a chap and a coat.       

49
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:18,710
           - Valentina          
     came down the runway--     

50
00:02:18,712 --> 00:02:20,245
     I'm talking about you,     
             bitch--            

51
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,679
          In a leotard.         

52
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:26,450
     I just don't understand    
    the hype about Valentina.   

53
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:29,953
     Listening to the judges    
     critiques, I felt ugly.    

54
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:33,389
 To hear someone constantly get 
  praised for just being pretty 

55
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:35,757
         when I'm trying        
          to compensate         

56
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,292
  with everything else I have,  
            it sucks.           

57
00:02:38,294 --> 00:02:40,561
     People always undermine    
            my drag.            

58
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:43,797
    But you know what, girl?    
    I think that I'm amazing.   

59
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:45,331
       That there's people      
     who think I'm amazing.     

60
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,199
         I deserve to be        
      in this competition.      

61
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:49,902
       - Aja's true colors      
         are coming out.        

62
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,771
      She presents herself      
as this person that's confident,

63
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,974
        but there's a lot       
      of insecurity there.      

64
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:57,275
       - I'm going to win       
  next challenge, mark my word. 

65
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,977
  Coming for you, Ms. Trinity!

     the third episode. Yes!

 my lucky number from Season 8.

             Ha-ha!

     are just crawling home     

86
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,651

96
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,439
      Now, Trinity, you won     
      last week's challenge     

97
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:21,742
      and Aja, you survived     
          the lip sync,         

98
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,077
           so you two           
       are team captains.       

99
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,945

100
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:28,880

     in morning television,

00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:31,582
    chemistry is everything.

00:04:31,584 --> 00:04:34,484

       starting with Aja.

          - Valentina.

     Valentina the side eye,    

105
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:42,790
       I am really curious      
   what the judges see in her   

106
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:46,026
        and maybe be able       
   to channel that in myself.

           - Ms. Cucu.

117
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:10,711
 - Outside of this competition, 

118
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:13,948
    Eureka and I have a very    
    up and down relationship,   

119
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,215
       but I picked Eureka      

120
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,616
         because I know         
     she's gonna work hard,     

121
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:17,917
      and I want to show Ru     

122
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,019
         that I can work        
          with anybody.         

123

     and Nina Bo'nina Brown.    

124

          Farrah Moan.

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,260
       - Which means Nina       
       is on Team Trinity.      

127
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,695
       - Come here, girl.       

128
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:37,767
   - Team Aja, you're the host  
   of "Good Morning Bitches."   

129
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:43,338
    And Team Trinity, you're    
   the host of "Not On Today."  

130
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,339
             - Yeah!            

131
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:46,541
         - Oh, and just         
         one more thing.        

132
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:49,777
    Your show is going to be    
         broadcast live.        

133
00:05:51,146 --> 00:05:53,712
           Gentlemen,           
       start your engines       

134
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:56,014
   and may the best woman win.  

135
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,083
       - #TeamNotOnToday.       

136
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:01,618
   - Nina, do not let the fact  

137
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,120
    that you were picked last   
          in your head          

138
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:05,288
        because I'm glad        
    that you're on our team.    

139
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:07,655
             - Okay.            

140
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:08,755
      But at the same time,     

141
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:10,624
        if you're, like,        
    saying that we love you,    

142
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:12,125
          when we have          
        to choose groups,       

143
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:13,560
   why would you run past me?   

144
00:06:13,562 --> 00:06:16,796
    I think the other queens    
   see me as a Debbie Downer,   

145
00:06:16,798 --> 00:06:18,331
            the girl            
      who gets in her head.     

146
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,799
    But I can't just pretend    
        when I'm over it.       

147
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:22,834
   I kind of wear my emotions   
          on my sleeve.         

148
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,302
       - So Team Captain,       

149
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:26,404
    is our television station   
        set in the South?       

150
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,506
         - There's three        
      Southern Belles here.     

151
00:06:29,508 --> 00:06:32,276
   - But "Not On Today" I feel  
     like is kind of ghetto.    

152
00:06:32,278 --> 00:06:33,276
    Do you think we should do   
         ghetto accent?         

153
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:34,477
            - No, no.           

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,212
      - I think the biggest     
      challenge for Trinity     

155
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:38,480
     is going to be keeping     
        everybody in line       

156
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:40,482
        'cause she's got        
     some big personalities.    

157
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:45,519
          Let's just--          
  She's got Eureka on the team. 

158
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:48,555
            [laughs]            
  And it may be kind of tough.  

159
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,258
         - Ghetto fierce        
       like, not on today.      

160
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,360
     - This--okay, so first     
    of all, as Team Captain,    

161
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:56,195
      I don't want anybody      
    to talk over each other.    

162
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:57,830
       So raise your hand       

163
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:59,597
       and let the person       
         that's talking         

164
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,598
   finish what they're saying.  

165
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
            - Ha-ha.            

166
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:03,834
      Here it comes, girl.      

167
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:06,470
            Step one            
     of competitive Trinity.    

168
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:10,040
    - Also, I think we would    
   have really good chemistry   

169
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,774
        so we're gonna be       
        the news anchors.       

170
00:07:11,776 --> 00:07:13,175
             - Okay.            

171
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:15,844
     - Then, because you're     
 really good at building stuff, 

172
00:07:15,846 --> 00:07:17,579
       you're really gonna      
       be good at the DIY.      

173
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:20,214
       And then, y'all are      
    definitely entertainment.   

174
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:23,216
      - We don't talk about     
  who wants to play what role.  

175
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:24,650
        Trinity is, like,       
     you're doing this role,    

176
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,018
     you're doing this role.    

177
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,020
 So, to me, it wasn't a leader, 
       it was a dictator.       

178
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,489
       - When Ru was like       
         "Not On Today,"        

179
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:34,057
        it did give that,       
      like, tinge of shade.     

180
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:35,292
      - Okay, I'm so sorry.     

181
00:07:35,294 --> 00:07:36,659
         - God, please.         

182
00:07:36,661 --> 00:07:39,028
     This is typical Eureka.    

183
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,797
  - You know, something shady.  
     - Maybe we each could--    

184
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,431
           - Maybe not          
       towards each other.      

185
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:43,832
          - This is me          
       holding my hand up       

186
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,466
     and following the rules    
      that we set in place.     

187
00:07:45,468 --> 00:07:47,968
 If you're gonna set the rules, 
        follow the rules.       

188
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,169
   - Eureka needs to shut up.   

189
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:53,038
        I'm trying to be        
      a good Southern Belle     

190
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,674
    and not punch this bitch    
          in the face.          

191
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,276
      - So all three of us      
 just need to have our own vibe.

192
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,578
         You all need...        

193
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,079
      - If y'all want to be     
       that ghetto--yeah.       

194
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:04,748
      - We're over-talking      
      each other, remember?     

195
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,749
           - [squawks]          

196
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,783
         - What I think         
        we should do now        

197
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,618
            is break            
      in our smaller groups     

198
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,986
    and then we'll reconvene    
  after we go over everything.  

199
00:08:10,988 --> 00:08:12,421
          - Yes, Miss.          

200
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,722
     - Eureka wants it to be    
        the Eureka Show,        

201
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:16,658
    but that's not happening.   

202
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,625
        Girl, no, ma'am.

00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:22,495

     - Live in three, two...    

204
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:25,531
           - First up,          
     we have Raja and Raven.    

205
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,665
         - Let's move on        
      to the next one--oh.      

206
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,267
       - And next, we have      
       Coco Montrese and--      

207
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:31,436
             - Next!

         [RuPaul laughs]        

211
00:08:42,947 --> 00:08:44,212
    - We're going to give you   
            the scoop           

212
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:47,581
      about Justin Bieber's     
      shocking new sex tape     

213
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,149
     with Dame Maggie Smith.    

214
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,817
     The challenge this week    

215
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,954
     is to cohost two rival     
       morning chat shows.      

216
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:56,656
   With my experience working   
    with "Live," I'm excited.   

217
00:08:56,658 --> 00:08:58,558
     But also, I don't want     
        to be just known        

218
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,460
 as that guy that does Madonna, 
       Cher and Lady Gaga.      

219
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,428
   I'd like to be known for me  

220
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,796
    because there's only one    
   Charlie Hides in the world.  

221
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:05,997
           Google it.           

222
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:08,799
    - Trust me, you are going   
         to watch this.         

223
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,867
         - You're going         
      to want to see this.      

224
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:12,435
      - Okay. You're want--     

225
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:14,370
          You're going          
     to wanted to see this.     

226
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:15,904
        - You're going--        
        You are going...        

227
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:18,105
    - Trust me. You are going   
      to want to see this.      

228
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:22,343
     - Cynthia has sometimes    
      a haphazard approach.     

229
00:09:22,345 --> 00:09:24,678
        And with comedy,        
    if you add an extra word,   

230
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,712
     you can blow the joke.     

231
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,313
           If you drop          
       a couple of words,       

232
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,647
     you can blow the joke.     

233
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,782
    - Trust me, you are going   
      to want to see this.      

234
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:31,982
      - And just say want.      

235
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:33,083
             - Want.            

236
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,517
     - You're going to want     
          to see this.          

237
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,020
    - Okay. Trust me, you are   
   going to want to see this.   

238
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:39,188
         - You're going         
      to want to see this.      

239
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,289
    - Want to see this, okay.   
             - Yeah.            

240
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,957
             - Okay.            
  - Yeah. But with a big smile. 

241
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:44,526
    - Charlie's very strict.    

242
00:09:44,528 --> 00:09:46,728
    She's trying to correct,    
  like, all the pronunciation,  

243
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,962
     and I appreciate that.     

244
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,997
      But that's what made      
       my character funny,      

245
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:53,300
   when I just pronounce words  
     that are mispronounced.    

246
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,269
    I'm Cynthia Lee Martinez

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,940
      - [chuckles] Charlie.     

250
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:04,609
         - I wouldn't--         
   I don't know if I'd laugh.   

251
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,377
         - Aye dios mio.        

252
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,612
    - Trust me, the laughing    
    is going to be dead air.    

253
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:10,947
     - Part of the challenge    
     is to show personality,    

254
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:12,915
    like how to be yourself.    

255
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:16,018
  And Charlie, in certain way,  
  is blocking me to be myself.  

256
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,119
          - Just smile,         
        just like, like,        

257
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,487
    like I want to knife you.   

258
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:22,222
     - Don't try to make me     
     something that I'm not     

259
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:25,725
     because that's gonna be    
           a disaster.          

260
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:28,027
             -Yeah?             
              -Yes.             

261
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,297
            - Hello.            

262
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,667
      - It's time to shoot      
    our rival morning shows.    

263
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,169

266
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,507
           -Gorgeous!           
              -Yes.             

267
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,643
         - This is live.        
     There are no take twos.    

268
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:50,879
      Embrace the mistakes      
 because some of the best magic 

269
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:52,380
     comes out of the stuff     
        that went wrong.        

270
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:54,882
           All right.           
  Take your place at the table. 

271
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,183
       We're almost live.       

272
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:59,619
        And we are ready        
     in five, four, three...    

273
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:05,824
    - Good morning, bitches.    

274
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:08,859
    It's the top of the hour    
 and time for today's headlines.

275
00:11:08,861 --> 00:11:10,594
          - The world's         
      hottest fashion trend     

276
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,329
           is acrylic           
       toenail extensions.      

277
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,496
           - Oh, dear.          

278
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:16,532
      - I actually just got     
      mine done yesterday.      

279
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,833
            - Oh, my!           

280
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:20,134
      I may have to give it     
    another thought, Farrah.    

281
00:11:20,136 --> 00:11:21,535
     - You won't regret it,     
             Alexis.            

282
00:11:21,537 --> 00:11:23,971
      -I'll drink to that.      
            -Cheers.            

283
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:25,472
          - [chuckles]          

284
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:27,073
      - All right. We're in     
   commercials. Let's move on.  

285
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:29,375
   Enter-taint-ment reporters,  
        take your places.       

286
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:34,379
- I don't really know where mine
 and Aja's relationship stands, 

287
00:11:34,381 --> 00:11:36,614
        but I have to do        
       the best that I can      

288
00:11:36,616 --> 00:11:38,382
       to connect with her      
         at this moment.        

289
00:11:38,384 --> 00:11:41,052
     - Live in three, two...    

290
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:43,721
     -Good morning, bitches.    
     -Good morning, bitches.    

291
00:11:43,723 --> 00:11:45,789
        - The latest meme       
    taking over the internet    

292
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,024
         is drag queens         
   without eyebrows or teeth.   

293
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:49,192
          -Oh, my God.          
        -Can you imagine?       

294
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:52,161
            First up,           
     we have Raja and Raven.    

295
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,895
             -Next.             
             -Next.             

296
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:56,763
         - Let's move on        
      to the next one--oh.      

297
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:00,166
    - And next, we have Coco    
  Montrese and Alyssa Edwards.  

298
00:12:00,168 --> 00:12:03,369
      - You sure--I thought     
   that was Laganja Estranja.   

299
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:05,537
          - Oh, my God!         

300
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,572
        - The resemblance       
        is uncanny, girl.       

301
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:10,307
             - True.            

302
00:12:11,676 --> 00:12:13,042
             - Next!            

303
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:15,277
       - And we're clear.       
        Commercial, guys.       

304
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,944
   - [imitates bomb dropping]   

305
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,280
       They have chemistry      
           all right,           

306
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:23,016
    but sometimes things can    
   combust in a chemistry lab.  

307
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:24,284
    You know what I'm saying?   

308
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,686
          - Here we go.         
    Coming out of commercial.   

309
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,654
      DIY, you're next. Go!     

310
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,290
       - Today, I'm going       
       to be teaching you       

311
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:36,294
    how to work in a RuPaul's   
  chocolate bar into your diet. 

312
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:39,064
    - I feel like people just   
   don't eat enough chocolate.  

313
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:40,398
      - You know, I agree.      

314
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,367
    I love eating chocolate.    

315
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,906
             -Sasha!            
            -[laughs]           

316
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:52,175
  - Do you have a solution for  
 people who love to eat dessert,

317
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:54,710
        but hate waiting        
    till the end of the meal?   

318
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:57,279
         - Why not take         
    a RuPaul's chocolate bar    

319
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,614
     and put it in a salad?     

320
00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,849
     -Yeah, toss that salad.    
          -Stir it up.          

321
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:02,983
      You want to try some?     

322
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:05,052
  - I thought you'd never ask.  

323
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:07,019
       - Do you like that?      

324
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:08,988
            - Mm-hmm.           

325
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,756
               No.              

326
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:13,358
             Sasha?             
            -Uh-huh.            

327
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,427
     - For queens that love     
    the gym--for queens--mm.    

328
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,029
            -[laughs]           
   -Tastes great, doesn't it?   

329
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,663
          -Oh, so good.         
            -[laughs]           

330
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:23,098
    - Sasha and I are really    
     leaning on each other.     

331
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,933
        We're having fun.       

332
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,601
     The jokes are landing.     

333
00:13:26,603 --> 00:13:27,868
         It feels right.        

334
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,103
          - So you take         
   a RuPaul's chocolate bar...  

335
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,271
       - Get out of town.       

336
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:34,106
        - And you hide it       
     in a stalk of broccoli.    

337
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,374
    - You're just a magician.   

338
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,342
           - [laughs]           

339
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:43,246
       - It's a chocolate       
           revolution.          

340
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:45,815
     - And we're clear. Cut!    

341
00:13:45,817 --> 00:13:47,516
           [all laugh]          

342
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:50,486
        Chew and swallow.       
           All right.           

343
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:52,321
     Reset for the celebrity    
      interview. Let's go.      

344
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:54,723
         - How are you?         

345
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:57,025
             -Hello.            
              -Hi!              

346
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,526
    - When I see Naya Rivera,   
         I'm like, yes!         

347
00:13:58,528 --> 00:13:59,693
          Come through.         

348
00:13:59,695 --> 00:14:01,961
      She was always one of     
     my favorites on "Glee."    

349
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:03,328
   - Are you ready to go live?  

350
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,097
       In three, two, go!       

351
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:07,165
        - Please welcome        
       our special guest,       

352
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,668
       actress and singer       
          Naya Rivera.          

353
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,269
       Good morning, Naya!      
  - Hi, good morning, bitches.  

354
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:13,604
           [all laugh]          

355
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:15,939
    - Well, Naya, what advice   
         would you have         

356
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:17,908
          for a starlet         
   who's trying to stick out.   

357
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,242
     - When I first started     
           on "Glee,"           

358
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,610
         I didn't have,         
        like, any lines,        

359
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:23,245
       so I would just sit      
  in the back of that classroom 

360
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,281
     and, like, roll my neck    

361
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:28,417
     and do anything I could    
    to get that camera on me.   

362
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:29,584
         And it worked.         

363
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,952
        - Congratulations       
        on your new book.       

364
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,854
        "Sorry Not Sorry"       
      is an amazing title.      

365
00:14:34,856 --> 00:14:35,855
    Where did that come from?   

366
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:37,089
    - The book is all about,    
            you know,           

367
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,657
   learning from your mistakes  

368
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:39,924
         and being sorry        
        about some things       

369
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,792
          and not sorry         
    about some other things.

00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:43,760
           -Same here.          
             -Right?            

371
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:47,030
     - So, Naya, what advice    
           do you have          

372
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:49,765
   to young aspiring actresses  

373
00:14:49,767 --> 00:14:51,934
    who want to make a career   
          in show biz.          

374
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:53,669
  - Find something else to do.

376
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,506
          - Well, Naya,         
   we cannot thank you enough   

377
00:14:58,508 --> 00:14:59,907
    for being with us today.    

378
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:01,241
    -Thank you for having me.   
      -It was so much fun.      

379
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:04,244
   - We'll be sure to see you   
     tomorrow morning for...    

380
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,713
    -"Good Morning Bitches."    
    -"Good Morning Bitches."    

381
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:11,116

384
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,752
         - I don't want         
        any extra breast        

385
00:15:15,754 --> 00:15:17,887
       other than--unless       
    they come with, uh, two--   

386
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,057
    two biscuits--two breasts   
        and two biscuits.       

387
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:24,625
         - I'm confused.        
     Peppermint's confused.     

388
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:26,593
   We're all fucking confused.

         [RuPaul laughs]        

391
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,835
     - It's time for my team    
   "Not On Today" to go live.   

392
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:42,173
          - Get ready!          
   Five, four, three, two, go!  

393
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,310
         - Good morning.        

394
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,278
    It's time for the biggest   
       stories of the day.      

395
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,580
          - The Center          
     for Infectious Diseases    

396
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,182
 has announced there's something
       in your makeup bag       

397
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:55,784
    that could be killing you   
           right now.           

398
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,886
  - I wonder what it could be?  

399
00:15:57,888 --> 00:15:59,487
 - I don't know, but whatever's 
       in your makeup bag,      

400
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:00,889
    you should throw it away.   

401
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,926
 - That's okay, because I'm sure
whatever I have in my makeup bag

402
00:16:05,928 --> 00:16:07,628
    would certainly kill you.   

403
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,064
     Uh, like your husband's    
         business card.         

404
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:17,803

        and science news,       

406
00:16:19,473 --> 00:16:21,639
  all of Michelle Visage's fans 
       have come together       

407
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:23,407
            to create           
     a crowdfunding campaign    

408
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:25,808
         to pay for her         
    breast reduction surgery.   

409
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,876
     You know, I don't want     
        any extra breast        

410
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:30,445

    they come with, uh, two--   

411
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,348
    two biscuits--two breasts   
        and two biscuits.       

412
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,317
             Jesus.             

413
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:40,219
            - Now for           
   the enter-taint-ment report

    and Cynthia Lee Fontaine.   

415
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,057
         - Good morning.        

416
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:47,158
      Today, we're talking      
          social media.         

417
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,959
  There's a fun new game people 
   are playing on the internet  

418
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:51,227
     called #SophiesChoices.    

419
00:16:51,229 --> 00:16:52,562
    I give you two scenarios.   

420
00:16:52,564 --> 00:16:54,997
      You tell me which one     
    of the two you'd choose.    

421
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:58,266
   You have to lick ice cream   
       off Nick Jonas' abs      

422
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:01,335
        or eat fudge off        
    Chris Hemsworth's chest.    

423
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:02,702
  - Let me tell you something.  

424
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:04,804
     I'm intolerant lactose.    

425
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:08,341
       I don't mind to go       
   all the way to the hospital  

426
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:11,777
        just only to eat        
       that banana split.       

427
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:12,711
           - [laughs]           

428
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,379
          - Do you have         
       a question for me?       

429
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:16,780
   -I got a question for you.   
             -Good.             

430
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:19,950
    - You get one night with    
   Justin Bieber totally naked  

431
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,585
        or one night with       
     Justin Bieber's money.     

432
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,620
      - So I would probably     
       have sex with him,       

433
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:27,022
      have a hidden camera,     
    send the pictures to TMZ    

434
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:29,291
    and then keep the money.    

435
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:30,658
   - I'm gonna keep the money   

436
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,859
             because            
     I don't know if Justin     

437
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:34,862
       had the opportunity      
      to deal with my cucu.     

438
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:39,899
        It's time for...        

439
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:42,735
    -Who Done Wore It Better.   
    -Who Done Wore It Better.   

440
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:45,637
     - Detox, the drag queen    
     or Detox, the pussycat?    

441
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:48,006
   - The cat looks incredible.  

442
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:49,407
           - [laughs]           

443
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:52,342
        - I'm looking at        
    Detox the pussycat's hair   

444
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,710
    and it looks a little bit   

445
00:17:53,712 --> 00:17:56,646
       like Winifred from       
      "Hocus Post--Pocus"?      

446
00:17:58,249 --> 00:17:59,682
   - Charlie, what's going on?  

447
00:17:59,684 --> 00:18:01,950
   He is cold as a dead body.   

448
00:18:01,952 --> 00:18:04,518
   He's so tense, so nervous.   

449
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,087
            - I think           
     we're gonna earn favor     

450
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:08,888
         of our--one of         
    our favorite drag queens,   

451
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,856
  Bob--uh, sorry, Thorgy Thor.  

452
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:12,490
           Shantay...           

453
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:14,192
           -You stay!           
           -You stay!           

454
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:16,927
         - And finally--        
    well, that's about all--    

455
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,863
    that's about all the time   
     we have for right now.     

456
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,131
     - Don't touch the dial!    

457
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,198
        - Don't touch me.       

458
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,633
       - And we're clear.       

459
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:24,601
        Commercial, guys.       

460
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,940
           We're live           
       in three, two, go.       

461
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:32,941
         - Welcome back.        

462
00:18:32,943 --> 00:18:34,243
    It's eight past the hour.   

463
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,178
 - Eureka and Nina Bo-nina Brown
            are here            

464
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,179
        to give us some--       
        give us some tips       

465
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:41,282
  on how to do drag on a dime.  

466
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,851
       - All right, Nina.       
   Now, this lace right here,   

467
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:49,355
     it is 100% human hair,     
      but it costs $7,300.      

468
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,257
      - Girl, what you need     
        to do is, honey,        

469
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:52,758
   get your platinum EBT card,  
              girl.             

470
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,859
             - Okay.            

471
00:18:53,861 --> 00:18:55,928
        - And go on down        
   to the Dollar Store, girl,   

472
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,830
      and get you a lavish      
     ramen noodle wig, girl.    

473
00:18:58,832 --> 00:18:59,831
    - Oh. Is it beef flavor?    

474
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,098
     - Ooh, chicken, bitch.     

475
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,769
      Goes for a mere price     
            of $6.00.           

476
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,438
       - Oh, it looks good      
     and tastes good, girl.     

477
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,973
              -Hey.             
             -Okay.             

478
00:19:09,975 --> 00:19:11,074
       Now, let's move on.      

479
00:19:11,076 --> 00:19:13,342
         We've got these        
     ass cheek pads, honey.     

480
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,511

481
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:16,945
        - Girl, a cheek.        

482
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,046
         You're doing it        
        all wrong, mama.        

483
00:19:18,048 --> 00:19:19,580
       Get this ham, girl.      

484
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:22,515
       For the mere price       
        of $8.00, honey.        

485
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:24,016
         - $8.00, bitch.        

486
00:19:24,018 --> 00:19:25,283
       - And stuff her up.      

487
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:27,118
             Oh, oh!            
       - Well, all right.       

488
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,953
     Oh, she's edible, too.     
    She look good and she...    

489
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:31,021
       -Tastes good, girl.      
       -Tastes good, girl.      

490
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:32,222
       - Great, and we're       
         in commercial.         

491
00:19:32,224 --> 00:19:34,524
         We're moving on        
   to the celebrity interview.  

492
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:37,459
          - Me and Nina         
       fucking killed it.       

493
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:38,826
         The ham's good.        

494
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:40,328
    Can I have another piece?   

495
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:46,099
       - We're coming back      
        in three, two...        

496
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,801
        - Please welcome        
     our very special guest,    

497
00:19:49,803 --> 00:19:52,770
       actress and singer       
          Naya Rivera.          

498
00:19:52,772 --> 00:19:54,038
    Are you happy to be here?   

499
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,272
      - Hi. "Not On Today."     

500
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:57,374
           [all laugh]          

501
00:19:57,376 --> 00:20:00,409
    - Now, I heard somewhere    
     that when you were 19,     

502
00:20:00,411 --> 00:20:01,977
     you lied on your resume    

503
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:04,012
          to get a job          
     at Abercrombie & Fitch?    

504
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:05,747
           -I did. I--          
 -Did you fudge the truth at all

505
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:07,781
       to get onto "Glee"?      

506
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:08,982
    - No. I had to actually--   

507
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,984
      I had to sing and act     
          for that one.         

508
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:13,152
 - What's the name of your book 
   and when is it coming out?   

509
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,653
          - It's called         
        "Sorry Not Sorry:       

510
00:20:14,655 --> 00:20:16,321
        Dreams, Mistakes        
         and Growing Up"        

511
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:18,789
        and it comes out        
         September 13th.        

512
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:22,326
         - I'm thinking         
   that Trinity and Peppermint  

513
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:26,730
      are not noticing that     
    it's time to wrap it up.    

514
00:20:26,732 --> 00:20:28,765
     - My publishers and I,     
 we just kind of really loved it

515
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,700
   and thought it was clever.   

516
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:32,001
       - It's not my job.       
       I'm not the anchor,      

517
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:33,869
but I'm just thinking Joy Behar,
       what would she do?       

518
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:35,236
   - I can't wait to read it.   

519
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:36,337
       - Thanks very much       
         for joining us.        

520
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:37,705
            It's time           
      to go to commercial.      

521
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,110
       - Do I get up now?       

522
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,978
         - I'm confused.        

523
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,212
     Peppermint's confused.     

524
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,281
   We're all fucking confused.  

525
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,285
         - Am I leaving?        

526
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:57,652
             - Okay.            

527
00:20:57,654 --> 00:21:00,621
       All right, ladies,       
       we're off the air,       

528
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:01,856
    but nobody said goodbye.    

529
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:06,592
    - This is definitely bad.   
         Bad, bad, bad.         

530
00:21:06,594 --> 00:21:07,760
    That's all I'm thinking,    
              bad.              

531
00:21:08,829 --> 00:21:10,261
         -<i> Coming up...</i>         

532
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:12,062
  - You're making a really bad  
    first impression with me.   

533
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:13,596
          - Why are you         
     talking over me, girl?     

534
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,832
        - I can hear you        
        talking about me.       

535
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:17,599
      - Because I'm upset.      

536
00:21:17,601 --> 00:21:20,335
   [RuPaul laughs, bell dings]  

537
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,704
         [RuPaul laughs]        

538
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:28,207
     -Good morning bitches.     
     -Good morning bitches.     

539
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,508
     - It's elimination day     

540
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,078
      and our runway today      
      is naughty nighties.      

541
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:37,347
   - How are you doing, girl?   

542
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,249
           - I'm okay.          
  I just don't want to go home. 

543
00:21:39,251 --> 00:21:40,717
             -Right.            
        -Me and Valentina       

544
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,685
      didn't have chemistry     
        in the challenge,       

545
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,187
      and it makes me feel      
         really nervous         

546
00:21:45,189 --> 00:21:47,055
     because I just came off    
           the bottom.          

547
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,557
  I think it's going to affect  
     how the judges see me.     

548
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,325
      You know me, Alexis.      
             - Yeah.            

549
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:52,559
           - You know           
      what I'm capable of.      

550
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,228
     Like, it's not my 100%.    

551
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,064
     - It's really hard when    
  you're in a pressure cooker.  

552
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,632
       - But I don't feel       
    like I'm under pressure.    

553
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,801
          I feel maybe          
       I'm overconfident.       

554
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:04,703
    - Aja, I'm not gonna lie.   

555
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:06,171
          You're, like,         
      oftentimes negative.      

556
00:22:07,541 --> 00:22:10,341
   You're making a really bad   
    first impression with me    

557
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:13,845
     because I can hear you     
in the corners talking about me.

558
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,647
   Maybe some advice is that,   
    like, don't focus on me.    

559
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,616
   Don't focus on other girls.  

560
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:19,883
        Focus in on you.        

561
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,918
       - I just feel like       

562
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,720
 I've been such a disappointment
      while I've been here,     

563
00:22:25,722 --> 00:22:29,690
        and I took it out       
     in all the wrong ways.     

564
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,158
         - All we can do        
         moving forward         

565
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,393
         is to be kinder        
    to each other, you know?    

566
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,493
        - Yeah, I agree.        

567
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,662
       I really genuinely       
         like Valentina.        

568
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:38,630
   I'm just really frustrated   

569
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:41,566
        because I really        
        want this so bad,       

570
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,201
         and I feel like        
         I'm fucked up.         

571
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:45,235
  You're a really good person.  
        I'm really sorry.       

572
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:47,270
           - I accept           
       your apology, babe.      

573
00:22:47,272 --> 00:22:48,637
       Just let me finish       
         doing my makeup        

574
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:49,938
   'cause it's more important.  

575
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,373
              -Aah!             
            -[laughs]           

576
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:54,608
    - Tell me about the work    
         you were doing         

577
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,608
      from HIV prevention.      

578
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,243
  - I do referrals for clients  

579
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,979
         who--they were         
    newly diagnosed with HIV.   

580
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,948
     - And it's so important    
        that people know.       

581
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,917
   I'm of the era when people   
  would be spreading the virus  

582
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,253
       before we even knew      
         it had a name.         

583
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:13,790
     I came out just before     
       AIDS became known.       

584
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,258
      So none of my friends     
       were playing safe.       

585
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,695
  I buried all my best friends, 
    most of my best friends,    

586
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:25,467
      and...that's probably     
       the hardest thing.       

587
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:27,835
            Sometimes           
    I have survivor's guilt.    

588
00:23:27,837 --> 00:23:29,036
     Like why did I survive?    

589
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,504
    It was a death sentence.    

590
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:33,173
    I've seen so many smart,    
   beautiful, talented people   

591
00:23:33,175 --> 00:23:36,042
   go the route of the pills,   
       drugs, the bottle.       

592
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:38,677
    Society was telling them    
    they are not good enough.   

593
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,079
         The one message        
       I try to get across      

594
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,347
   is you're worth it, you're   
   special, you're beautiful.   

595
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,650
        And you're worth        
    taking care of yourself.    

596
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:47,852
            [sobbing]           
    So you gotta stay strong,   

597
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:50,287
       and you gotta rely       
        on your friends.        

598
00:23:53,791 --> 00:23:55,991
     - Thank you for sharing    
           that story.          

599
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:58,793
   Because of your generation,  
   we appreciate what we have.  

600
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:00,293
        - It's important        
          to not forget         

601
00:24:00,295 --> 00:24:03,196
          what happened         
  in the eighties and nineties  

602
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,730
     during the AIDS crisis     

603
00:24:04,732 --> 00:24:07,099
          and how many          
        brilliant voices        

604
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,334
  in the world of art and drag  

605
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:12,270
          we could have         
      without those losses.     

606
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:15,039
   - My makeup is going to be   
  fucking ruined on the runway. 

607
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,140
     - Do a smoky eye, girl.    

608
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,408
           - [laughs]           

609
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:21,310
     - Does anyone here have    
      psoriasis or just me?     

610
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:23,311
       - I have bad acne.       

611
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:24,545
   - I have really bad breath   
         in the morning.        

612
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:25,946
             - Eew.             

613
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:28,114
   - Can I tell you guys about  
one of the disorders that I have

614
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:29,782
    that I'm struggling with?   

615
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,417
            - Eating.           

616
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:34,053
    - Don't joke about that.    

617
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,421
             Eureka,            
    it's really inappropriate   

618
00:24:36,423 --> 00:24:37,888
       to joke about that.      
    - Sasha, okay, I realize,   

619
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,324
         but why push it        
     straight to negativity?    

620
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:42,325
- I don't think she's pushing it
     straight to negativity.    

621
00:24:42,327 --> 00:24:46,295
  I think that she's trying to  
   keep the levels respectful.  

622
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:48,697
     - By trying to make me     
     look like a bad person?    

623
00:24:48,699 --> 00:24:50,732
        - I have nothing        
          against you,          

624
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:52,700
    but I have a long history   
     with eating disorders.     

625
00:24:52,702 --> 00:24:54,034
       You don't know now       
       by looking at me--       

626
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:55,269
   - There are other types of   
   eating disorders besides--   

627
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:56,436
       - But so many times      
          in my life--          

628
00:24:56,438 --> 00:24:58,505
       Why are you talking      
         over me, girl?         

629
00:24:58,507 --> 00:25:00,340
      - Because I'm upset.      

630
00:25:00,342 --> 00:25:02,808
     I make the joke to try     
     to make the air light.     

631
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,242
         I'm not trying         
         to be malicious        

632
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:06,978
     and I'm all of a sudden    
       not a good person.       

633
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,512
 - Can I tell you how many times
    people have looked at me    

634
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:10,514
   and been like, oh, my God,   
        you're anorexic.        

635
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:12,048
      It's really hurtful.      

636
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,883
         - I never come         
        at any of you all       

637
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:15,451
       with a nasty tone,       
           so when I--          

638
00:25:15,453 --> 00:25:17,086
     - I really didn't think    
       I was being nasty.       

639
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:18,453
    - Let me finish, please.    

640
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,154
    But you had a nasty tone,   

641
00:25:20,156 --> 00:25:21,422
    and that's what upset me    
            about it.           

642
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:22,489
  - Look, I'm coming over here  

643
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:24,191
     because if it came off     
          as an attack,         

644
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:25,292
      I do truly apologize.     

645
00:25:25,294 --> 00:25:26,726
    I would never want that.    
       I am just trying--       

646
00:25:26,728 --> 00:25:28,961
  - Well, I apologize that you  
  were offended by what I said. 

647
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,295
           - I wasn't.          

648
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:33,365
  - You obviously were offended 
     at what I said, right?     

649
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,833
        What do you want        
         from me, girl?         

650
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,100
         Do you want me         
     to get down on my knees    

651
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,668
   and beg you to forgive me?   

652
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,136
         - Girl, please.        

653
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,605
    - I think I want you guys   

654

         for the runway.

           so I can go

      underlining despise.

      - On a morning show,

00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:55,502
   I think that you could have  
 put a lot more effort into it. 

744
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:56,803
            - I think           
      it's a little short,      

745
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:58,538
    so when you turn around,    
    like, we're seeing stuff.   

746
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,774
      - Though you fumbled      
     the ball a few times...    

747
00:30:01,776 --> 00:30:03,742
  - A breast and two biscuits.  

748
00:30:03,744 --> 00:30:06,077
   - I thought your character   
         was fun-loving.        

749
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,979
          I don't know          
        whose job it was        

750
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:10,448
          to, I guess,          
    excuse me from the table    

751
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:13,217
     so that, as the guest,     
   I knew that I could leave.   

752
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:14,851
    I don't know who dropped    
      the ball on that one.     

753
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:16,519
   - Can I take responsibility  
            for that?           

754
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:18,320
     I was a little confused    
           at the end.          

755
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:19,488
             - Okay.            

756
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,688
   - I'll take responsibility   
          for it, too.          

757
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,424
           I'm sorry,           
    I don't want you to think   

758
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:24,858
      that you were, like,      
        an afterthought.        

759
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,926
    - No, no, no, not at all.   

760
00:30:25,928 --> 00:30:27,493
        But you could get       
        some real bitches       

761
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:29,528
       that would take it       
         personal, so...        

762
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:32,930
      - Dame Charlie Hides.     

763
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,798
   - I love the look tonight.   

764
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,798
          I was worried         
    you were gonna fall over.   

765
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,900
   Those are some high heels.   

766
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,100
      -They are very high.      
           -Very high.          

767
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,569
      - But what I noticed      
     about your performance     

768
00:30:40,571 --> 00:30:42,704
         is that you are        
        a control freak.        

769
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:45,807
       You were so married      
         to those cards.        

770
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:47,174
   Cynthia didn't even finish   
            her line            

771
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:49,109
     and you already, like,     
        look, look, look.       

772
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:51,344
        And when you were       
       interviewing Naya,       

773
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:54,080
      when you ask somebody     
           a question,          

774
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,914
            you need            
     to let them answer it.     

775
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:58,082
     - It felt like you were    
      stepping on her lines     

776
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:01,252
     and the timing was off.    

777
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:05,589
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.     

778
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:07,290
   - To me, this does not read  
           as nightie,          

779
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:09,592
   but what I loved about you   
        in the challenge        

780
00:31:09,594 --> 00:31:11,093
   was that even when Charlie   

781
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:13,962
    was trying to direct you    
     in her controlling way,    

782
00:31:13,964 --> 00:31:17,232
         you were funny         
  and you messed the words up.  

783
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:18,533
            You were            
    intolerant lactose and...   

784
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:21,135
            -[laughs]           
        -You are a star.        

785
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,937
   I really think that you've,  
    like, come into your own.   

786
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:23,937
        Really well done.       

787
00:31:23,939 --> 00:31:25,371
          - Thank you.          

788
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:26,572
            - Eureka.           

789
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:27,873
   - Again, this doesn't read   
         nightie to me.         

790
00:31:27,875 --> 00:31:29,841
     This reads dominatrix.     

791
00:31:29,843 --> 00:31:32,377
   It's so funny how this end   
        is really nightie       

792
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,578
  and that end is just whores.  
           - [laughs]           

793
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,780
   - Well, surprise, surprise,  
    I disagree with Michelle.   

794
00:31:36,782 --> 00:31:38,581
  You're clearly going to bed.  

795
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:39,582
        You're just doing       
        different things        

796
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:40,850
   on that side of the runway.  

797
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:42,618
            - You two           
   were my favorite to watch.   

798
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,586
   Chemistry is not something   
          you can buy.          

799
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:46,154
       That's why this one      
      has me around still.      

800
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:47,388
           - [laughs]           

801
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,892
  - Up next, Nina Bo'nina Brown 
         Rodham Clinton.        

802
00:31:51,894 --> 00:31:53,527
           [all laugh]          

803
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:57,230
          - [sniffling]         

804
00:31:57,232 --> 00:31:59,832
   I'm gonna probably be like   
   the cry baby of the season.  

805
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:06,138
        -It's okay, mama.       
           -I'm sorry.          

806
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,139
      I'm just so grateful      
           to be here.          

807
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:10,007
        [sobs] I'm happy.       

808
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,843
          - Well, Nina,         
   if those are tears of joy,   

809
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:15,044
       I'd hate to see you      
       when you're upset.       

810
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:17,346
           [all laugh]          

811
00:32:17,348 --> 00:32:18,447
       We love you, girl.       

812
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:20,115
   Let's go to the critiques.   

813
00:32:20,117 --> 00:32:22,016
   - Again, it doesn't scream   
         nightie to me.         

814
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,685
           It screams           
      streetwalking whore.      

815
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,586
         And I love it!         

816
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:27,620
       - In the talk show,      

817
00:32:27,622 --> 00:32:30,356
       you were serving me      
   the Lady Chablis realness.   

818
00:32:30,358 --> 00:32:31,591
    The painted on spit curl    

819
00:32:31,593 --> 00:32:33,225
          was just like         
       the cherry on top.       

820
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,059
     - But you're gonna need    
         a thicker skin         

821
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,594
         to get through         
        this competition.       

822
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:40,264
         I so appreciate        
     what this means to you.    

823
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,533
   I just want you to be ready  

824
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:44,134
          for how tough         
       this is gonna get.       

825
00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:48,871
    - You all worked so hard    
       on this challenge,       

826
00:32:48,873 --> 00:32:51,407
        but I have to ask       
          one question.         

827
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:55,945
     Who deserves to go home    
        tonight and why?        

828
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,279
         Trinity Taylor.        

829
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,247
   - Just from your critique,   
      it would be Charlie.      

830
00:33:00,249 --> 00:33:01,981
          - Peppermint,         
         same question.         

831
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:04,083
    - Based on the critiques,   
            Charlie.            

832
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:05,918
        - Charlie Hides.        

833
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,821
  - Peppermint's look is a bit  
   more basic, so Peppermint.   

834
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,622
     - Cynthia Lee Fontaine.    

835
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:15,559
    - Because I believe she's   
   a strong competition for me  

836
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:19,095
       and her total look,      
           Peppermint.          

837
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,163
      - All right, Eureka,      
           you're up.           

838
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,163
     - I would say Trinity.     

839
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:24,666
           I feel like          
       the ending wrap-up       

840
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,701
         might have been        
    a little more controlled    

841
00:33:26,703 --> 00:33:28,002
    if we worked as a group.    

842
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:31,372
      And I also felt like      
   she was focused on herself   

843
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:34,007
     and not really so much     
        of everyone else.       

844
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,641
         - I call shade.        

845
00:33:35,643 --> 00:33:38,477
    I take responsibility for   
   the things that I did wrong  

846
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:41,179
    and if that's the reason    
      why I should go home,     

847
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:42,614
       then I understand.       

848
00:33:42,616 --> 00:33:44,816
     But don't tell me that     
 I didn't do my job as a leader,

849
00:33:44,818 --> 00:33:46,083
         because I did.         

850
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:49,253
    And I included everybody,   
     including you, Eureka.     

851
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:51,721
       - Well, I was asked      
       my honest opinion,       

852
00:33:51,723 --> 00:33:54,123
  and that's my honest opinion  
     and I stand beside it.     

853
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:56,859
       - All right. Nina.       

854
00:33:56,861 --> 00:33:58,160
       - Trinity, because       
      she was the captain.      

855
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,761
      But she did her job.      

856
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:02,030
 It's just that we didn't really
  feel a part of it sometimes.  

857
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,332
      - Thank you, ladies.      
   Thank you for your honesty.  

858
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,567
   While you untuck backstage,  

859
00:34:08,569 --> 00:34:10,468
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

860
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,469
       [car engine starts]      
           All right.           

861
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:15,405
 Well, just between us squirrel 
   friends, what do you think?  

862
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,807
         Let's start off        
      with Trinity Taylor.      

863
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:20,176
  - Her morning talk show host, 
      I just didn't get it.     

864
00:34:20,178 --> 00:34:21,843
        - I think Trinity       
        really tripped up

         they were doing        

866
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:28,382
   because it didn't allow her  
    to be her charming self.    

867
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:30,417
           Peppermint.          
       - My first thought       

868
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:33,086
            was that            
   it seemed like a rehearsal.  

869
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,954
   - For me, it was more about  
       her outfit tonight.      

870
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:39,557
     - The black lace shirt     
  with a pink wrinkled nightie, 

871
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,425
    it just was a whole bunch   
           of a mess.           

872
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:45,696
    But I liked her better of   
 the two in the anchor position.

873
00:34:45,698 --> 00:34:46,963
        - Charlie Hides.        

874
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:48,130
           - The walk           
     on the runway tonight,     

875
00:34:48,132 --> 00:34:50,231
   she seemed tired or bored.   

876
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:51,465
    She just wasn't shining.    

877
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,633
   - She was my least favorite  
        in the challenge.       

878
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:56,469
   - My notes next to her name  
    say dead behind the eyes.   

879
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,838
            Gave up.

880
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,141
     - I'm just disappointed    
  that a seasoned vet like that 

881
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,875
       doesn't understand       
          how TV works.         

882
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:05,476
        She didn't allow        
      the moment to happen.     

883
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:09,513
   In fact, it almost impeded   
  on Cynthia Lee's performance. 

884
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:11,214
      Cynthia Lee Fontaine.     

885

  - She was so fierce tonight.  

886
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:16,718
   She was giving, like, X-Men  
   weird angel/devil realness.  

887
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,186
       - In her challenge,      
      she was so much fun.      

888
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:19,620

       stop watching her.       

889

    -I liked her immediately.   

892
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:29,695
  She was funny, she was real,  
       she was believable.      

893
00:35:29,697 --> 00:35:31,096
       - If I see a poster      
       for Eureka's show,       

894
00:35:31,098 --> 00:35:32,831
       I'm buying a ticket

895
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,732
          - When I find         
       where her show is,       

896
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:35,799
   do you want to go with me?   

897
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:38,234
          - Girl, yes.

900
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,540
    Walking down the runway,    
       she was incredible       

901
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:47,375
      and in the challenge,     
        she was on fire.        

902
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:50,677
     - But the vulnerability    
           is so raw,           

903
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,012
     I just worry about her.    

904
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:54,114
         - This industry        
    can be quite challenging,   

905
00:35:54,116 --> 00:35:56,182
  and you can't show up to work

          - Thank you.          

989
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:09,220
      - Dame Charlie Hides.     

990
00:40:09,222 --> 00:40:12,723
         London, Boston,        
       and now the world.       

991
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:15,092
          Sashay away.          

992
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:16,359
        - Thank you, Ru.        

993
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:18,995
  It's been a pleasure, girls.  

994
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:21,296
      I am a control freak.     

995
00:40:21,298 --> 00:40:23,131
       I make no apologies      
            for that.           

996
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,466
      And I don't lip sync.     
          I sing live.          

997
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:27,468
         I always said,         
   if I get in the bottom two,  

998
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,369
         I might as well        
  just turn around and walk out 

999
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:31,004
    because I don't lip sync.   

1000
00:40:31,006 --> 00:40:34,006
          Older queens,         
  I'm laying down the gauntlet. 

1001
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,408
             Send in            
      your application tape     

1002
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,877
    and do better than I did,   
             please.            

1003
00:40:40,347 --> 00:40:43,248
      - Con-drag-ulations,      
           my queens.           

1004
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,418
        Oh, and remember,       
   if you can't love yourself,  

1005
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,187
         how in the hell        
  you gonna love somebody else? 

1006
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:52,289
        Can I get an amen       
         up in "herre"?         

1007
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,090
             -Amen!             
             -Amen!             

1008
00:40:54,092 --> 00:40:56,659
      - Let the music play.     

1009
00:40:56,661 --> 00:40:58,160
     -<i>  Hey, get it, girl </i>    

1010
00:40:58,162 --> 00:40:59,561
      <i>  It's your world </i>      

1011
00:40:59,563 --> 00:41:00,562
            <i>  Hey </i>            

1012
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:03,364
    <i>  Get it, get it, girl </i>   

1013
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,866
         <i>  Whoa-oh-oh </i>
