Hey.

{n8}Yes. I perform and host
in New York.

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,040
{n8}When you come
to a Peppermint show,

15
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:42,109
{n8}you're gonna see people
screaming and hollering,

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,845
{n8}money flying and
you're gonna feel special.

17
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,346
{n8}I look great. Perfect.

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,416
{n8}My braids are sitting just right.

19
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,617
{n8}I got it going on.

20
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:53,186
All right,
let's get to work.

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:01:00,661
Hello. It's me, Valentina.

{n8}Sass.

26
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,338

-Mwah.

29
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,476
{n8}My type of drag,
it's very dramatic,

30
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,446
{n8}very theatrical
and always very Latina.

31
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,682
{n8}I'm an undiscovered superstar.

32
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
{n8}I've always dreamed
of being in here,

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,418
and here we are, girlfriend.

34
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,887
Here we are, girl.

00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:39,900
{n8}My name is Eureka,
and I am 25 years old.

38
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,669
People would categorize me
as a pageant queen,

39
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:47,441
{n8}but to me, my drag
is the genre of fabulous.

40
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,942
{n8}[laughs]

41
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,544
Hi, I'm Eureka.

42
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,346
-Where are you from?
-East Tennessee.

43
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,614
Girl, I'm country
as a biscuit, honey,

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,048
and I love eating 'em, too.

45
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,583
Your hair's hot.

46
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,819
-Thank you, girl.
-I love the baby hairs.

47
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,854
I'm a little natural around the way,
girl, you know.

48
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:03,190
That's my favorite shape
is round.

49
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,691
I can see.

50
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,728
I'll eat you.

Hi, hi, hi.

53
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,501
It's about to get shady
up in here.

54
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:18,105
{n8}My name is Charlie Hides
and I'm [muffled] years old.

-Hey!
-Hey!

57
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,744
Oh, my God,
Peppermint's here.

58
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,646
{n8}I'm known as a celebrity
impersonator.

59
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,749
My drag persona
is rude, crude,

60
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,917
{n8}socially unacceptable
and over the top.

61
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,185
Can I ask you,
with that dress,

62
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,921
why didn't you wear like
a big pair of earrings?

63
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,425
I really wanted to give you, like,
Walmart realness.

64
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,127
- I'm getting that, Eureka.
-Thank you.

65

[all laugh]

66
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,101
It's Christina Aguilera.

67
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,003
So this is what
it looks like.

68
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,371
[Eureka] She's naked.

69
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:55,008
{n8}My name is Farrah Moan,
and I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada.

70
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,309
Oh, my God, dirty.

71
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,912
{n8}My drag is inspired
by Vegas showgirls.

72
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,147
My wardrobe
shows a lot of skin

73
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,749
and there's usually
a feather or two

74
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,484
{n8}or five dead ostriches.

75
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,752
{n8}You never know with me.

76
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,187
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Charlie.

77
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,255
-Charlie.
-What's your name?

78
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,556
Farrah. Farrah Moan.

79
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,124
Farrah Moan walks in.

80
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,827
She's a twig,
and she looks about 12.

81
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,396
I have underwear older than her.

82
00:03:16,463 --> 00:03:19,399
Hi. I'm Eureka,
like the vacuum cleaner.

83
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,467
How are you?

84
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,636
I've never vacuumed before.

85
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,738
Well, I came
to clean house, girl.

86
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:36,983
{n8}[screaming] Aah!

87
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,885
What?

88
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,588
[screaming] Aah!

89
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,125
[coughs]

90
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,626
Oh, wow.

91
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,328
{n8}My name is Sasha Velour.

92
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,197
{n8}I am 29 years old.

93
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,167
I am a bald, fashiony,
artistic weird queen.

94
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,669
Hi, ladies.

95
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:59,372

uniquely Sasha all the time.

[Eureka] Tell us about yourself.

97
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,675
I'm a visual artist.

98
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:04,244
I love telling stories
with art and with drag.

99
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:06,913
What story are you telling
with this unibrow?

100
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,549
[laughs]

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,656
How do you like them egg rolls,
Mr. Charles?

102
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,558
{n8}I'm Alexis Michelle,

103
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,328
{n8}and I am New York City's
premier Broadway queen.

104
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,196
Holy shit.

105
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,464
Hello!

106
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,399
{n8}I went to school
for musical theater.

107
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,335
I think
the ultimate fantasy now

108
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,337
{n8}would be to be on Broadway
in drag.

109
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,272
-Girl.
-Come on, New York.

110
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,241
So the East Coast
is well represented.

111
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,511
I will say L.A., West Coast,

112
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,613
it's the center of the universe.

113
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,781
Sorry, New York.

114
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,518
She says forget
what you heard, apparently.

115
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,353
Memo taken.

116
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,860
My name is Shea Coulee,
and I didn't come to play.

117
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,695
I came to slay.

118
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,831
[contestant]
I love The Muppets.

119
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,033
{n8}I'm Shea Coulee,
and I'm 27 years old.

120
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,203
Shea Coulee is...
champagne lifestyle

121
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,905
{n8}on a lemonade budget.

122
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,339
Hey!

123
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,908
You're gonna get
a full-on production

124
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,209
{n8}when you see Shea Coulee.

125
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,478
{n8}Costumes, check.
Makeup, check.

126
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,180
{n8}Dance moves, she got 'em.

127
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,115
-Where are you from?
-I'm from Chicago.

128
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,316
Yes, Chicago.

129
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:17,584
[all laugh]

130
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,487
Chicago drag is the
motherfucking bomb-dot-com.

131
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,556
-Dot-com?
-Yes, bitch.

132
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,723
It's got its own domain.

133
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,058
[all laugh]

134
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,230
The body is here, bitches.

135
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,298
Oh, shit.

136
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,766
Girl, I'm Trinity Taylor.

137
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,235
{n8}Some people say I'm the look
and feel of real,

138
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,571
but my body speaks for itself.

139
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,872
Shut it down!

140
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,807
{n8}Trinity does not pad.

141
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,442
I love plastic surgery,

142
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,779
{n8}and I went from a pancake
to a Kardashian.

143
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,147
I do a lot of pageants,

144
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:51,117
{n8}but I don't like to use
the word pageant queen

145
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,055
{n8}because there's such
a stigmatism with pageant queen.

146
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,189
I can do anything,

147
00:05:56,256 --> 00:06:00,126
from beautiful
to way outside the box.

148
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,463
Oh, my God. Lady!

149
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,732
Bitch, I'm just excited
to know somebody.

150
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,702
[Eureka] Me and Trinity know
each other from competing.

151
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,571
She, like, won the pageant
that I really wanted to win

152
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:14,808
{n8}so, of course, there's that, like,
bougie attitude from her.

153
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,943
I am the body girl.

154
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,645
I'm here
and I'm not padded.

155
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,680
She's gonna be competition.

156
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,116
Who are the pageant girls?

157
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,784
You're a pageant girl,
I'm a pageant girl,

158
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:25,852
you're a pageant girl.

159
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,120
Just to clear the air,

160
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,990
I promise I'm not
one of the mean ones.

161
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,391
[all laugh]

162
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,726
That is a lie.

163
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,960
-Oh.
-Ooh.

164
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:37,464
{n8}There's always been tension
with me and Eureka.

165
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,565
{n8}Maybe she has an issue
with the fact

166
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,567
{n8}that every pageant
that we've been in,

167
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,868
{n8}I beat her.

168
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,874
Is it me
or is it hot in here?

169
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:51,678
{n8}I'm Kimora Blac
from Las Vegas.

170
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,180
{n8}The queen is here.
Bow down, bitches.

171
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,682
Oh, you ain't
the only body, girl.

172
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,084
I love anything see-through

173
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,120
{n8}and anything
that shows my body.

174
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:03,456
Big tits, big ass,
irresistible.

175
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,891
Gay guys love me,
straight guys love me.

176
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,394
{n8}Kimora Blac is everyone's
sexual preference.

177

-Oh, my God!

178
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,798

{n8}Kimora's ass is famous.

182
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,606
That's what she's
gonna be known for.

183
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,041
{n8}That ass is gonna have
its own t-shirts.

184
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,143
{n8}I can see it all now.

185
00:07:24,344 --> 00:07:25,946
Season 9, baby.

186
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,681
How long
you been doing drag?

187
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,049
Oh, my God, 10 long years.

188
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,084
-Brava.
-10 long years.

189
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,720
[Valentina] 10 months.

190
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,555
And you can go to hell.

191
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,925
[Valentina] My debut was 10 months ago
when I performed.

192
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,162
I can't. I can't.
I can't with her.

193
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,030
I'm fairly new to drag,

194
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,832
{n8}but I wouldn't consider myself

195
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,867
{n8}looking like
an amateur drag queen.

196
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,003

and a superstar.

197

-Come on, drag babies.
-[laughs]

198
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,075
Hi, shape-shifters.

199
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,248
{n8}I am Jaymes Mansfield,
I am 26 years old,

Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

201
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,518
I build puppets.

202
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,053
{n8}I'm a kooky, comedy queen

203
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,989
{n8}that has way more
up her sleeve than they know.

204
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,094
[contestant] All right.

205
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,563
{n8}Jaymes Mansfield looks...

206
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,066
{n8}scared and confused
when she walks in.

207
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,902
{n8}Like, am I
in the right room?

208
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,005
[puppet] Hi, honey.
-Oh, my goodness.

209
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,072
These are my
summer diamonds.

210
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,941
Some are diamonds
and some are not.

211
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,142
[all laugh]

212
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:31,378
Is this all fake
or is it real?

213
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:35,382
Um, I'd say the foot upward,
it's all fake.

214
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,617
I meant your personality.

215
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,253
[all] Ooh.

216
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,759

to shut her down.

220
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,835
{n8}Well, no, I can't say
I'm back in town,

221
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,137
{n8}'cause I haven't even
been in town yet.

222
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,738
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,974
[Eureka]
She seems a little mousy.

224
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,809
Hey, sisters.

225
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,110
-Yay!
-Yes.

226
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,279
My drag consists of fantasy.

227
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,681
{n8}One minute I may be a zombie.
The next time I may be a nun.

228
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,051
I'm not cosplay.

229
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,318
{n8}Nobody does what I do.

230
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,953
What inspired your look?

231
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,356
Well, you know, my drag
is like universal, honey.

232
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,424
You never know
what you're gonna get.

233
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,992
So your drag's like STDs.

234
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,126
You never know
what you're gonna get.

235
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,328
Exactly.

236
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,800

Yeah.

240
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,342
Aja is vangy.

Oh, you are so gorgeous

00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,500
Thank you, thank you.
So nice to meet you.

251
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:03,903
{n8}Aja's makeup is just really
rough around the edges,

252
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,739
{n8}but she comes off
as confident.

253
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,175
Does she know
what she looks like?

254
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,177
{n8}'Cause if not,
I need to tell her.

255
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,947
I feel like I'm at home
with so much talented girls.

-Yes!
-Oh!

257

I'm New Jersey's number one
Lady Gaga impersonator.

266
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,109
But what I'm really
excited about

267
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:45,278
is how long it takes

268
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,348
for these queens to figure out
that it's really me.

269
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,421
Is it time to go home?

270
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,257
[laughs]

271
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,659

Wait a minute.

279
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,659
Aah!

280
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,894
[screaming]

281
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,563
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

282
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,732
I can't tell you,
I have been the closest to death

283
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,034
and you've pulled me out of it,

284
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,735
and you don't even realize
what you do for people

285
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,406
and how much you inspire people
like me and all of us.

286
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,908
And I just want to tell you,
you're so amazing,

287
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,177
and I never thought in the world
I would ever meet you.

288
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,947
And I think you're so incredible.
I'm so sorry.

289
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,449
I think you're so incredible.

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,424
You allow us to be who we are
as an artist. Thank you.

293
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,261
I have always really admired

294
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,030
the craftsmanship that
goes into what you all do.

295
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,499
Drag has for me
been an opportunity

296
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:17,971
to leave myself
when I didn't want to be me.

297
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,505
-Right.
-Yeah.

298
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,209
And felt so completely out of place
when I was in high school.

299
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:26,079
Drag has just been part
of my life for the longest time.

300
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,081
It's just really an honor
for me to be here,

301
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,549
to be with you all.

302
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,751
-No, it's an honor for us.
-Yes, Gaga.

303
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:35,355

Oh, darling, mwah, mwah.

00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,506
You look amazing.

312
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,275
Thank you, so do you.

313
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,610
Now you've had a chance
to meet my girls.

314
00:12:57,677 --> 00:12:59,279
Do you have any advice
for them?

315
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,647
You know, when
you're having a bad day,

316
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,749
just remember
that I was nobody,

317
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,617
and then I became somebody
one day.

318
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,019
And it's the same right here.

319
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,488
-Ah!
-Yes.

Your lives are gonna
change forever today.

And I would also
remember something

322
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,662
that you taught me
a very long time ago.

323
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,763
Get the money up front?

324
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,364
Yes, and on the back.

326
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,669

342
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,905
is going home.

343
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,940
[all] Oh!

344
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,277
- [gasps] Crack, crack,
crack, crack, crack, pshew!

345
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,012
Face on the floor.

346
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,881
{n8}- #OhMyGaga.

347
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:12,618
{n8}And ladies, to get
this episode started,

348
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,320
we're throwing a pageant.

349
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,688
[all] Oh.

350
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,423
Yes, Miss Thing,

351
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:22,395
the Miss Charisma Uniqueness,
Nerve & Talent Pageant.

352
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,763
[all laugh]

353
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,298
-Yes!
-Oh, my God!

354
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,766
I can do this.

355
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,202
{n8}I want to show these bitches
that I'm the one to look out for.

356
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,671
You'll be competing
in two categories.

357
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:35,007
First, you need to show us
where you're from

358
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:38,344
with a frock
inspired by your home city.

359
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:42,949
Second, as a salute
to our legendary guest star,

360
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,016
you need to strut your stuff

361
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,054
in your favorite
Lady Gaga drag.

362
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:51,391
So don't be a drag,
just be a queen.

363
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:56,162
[cheers and applause]

364
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,431
Lady Gaga,
would you do the honors?

365
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,768
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

366
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:05,838
and may the best woman win.

367
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,342
-Whoo!
-Yes!

368
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,546
-Move, bitch.
-Oh, my God, up.

369
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,148
-Watch out now.
-Ow!

370
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,150
I'm right behind you,
honey. Sorry, guys.

371
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,384
Where am I gonna go?
Where am I gonna go?

372
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,319
This first challenge
is very important

373
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,189
because this is the first
impression that you make.

374
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,925
{n8}No one can afford to fuck
this shit up.

375
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,026
Bam, bam, bam.

376
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,528
Are they sure this wasn't
the challenge,

377
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,197
'cause I feel like I’m winded.

378
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,869
[Farrah] Is this already
a claimed work station?

379
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,404
Hello?

380
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,972
Am I missing something?

381
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,641
Can someone tell me

382
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,910
if there's another station somewhere
that I'm not seeing?

383
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,077
[sighs]

384
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:49,649
{n8}Farrah is awkwardly endearing
with the way that she whines.

385
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,452
So am I,
like, Matilda or something?

386
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,154
I call her
Blonde Benet Glamsey

387
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:59,592
'cause she whines like
a 6-year-old, so, huh.

388
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,428
[Farrah] I really want
a station of my own.

389
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,265
[Peppermint] So have you ever done
a Gaga look before?

390
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:08,100
Yeah, 'cause I've played her
a bunch of times in my video.

391
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,602
-Oh, yeah, in your videos.
-I make YouTube videos,

392
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,538
{n8}which I make by myself
in my living room.

393
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,775
I've been making fun of Lady Gaga
on YouTube for years.

394
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,977
I am always afraid that
when I impersonate people

395
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,645
that they're gonna watch
my videos.

396
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,281
Lana del Rey said I was
an asshole, apparently.

397
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,050
Lana del Rey
called you an asshole?

398
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,318
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,588
Charlie has a very on-the-edge
kind of sense of humor.

400
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,423
It's an acquired taste,

401
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,126
and I'm not sure if the judges
have acquired that taste.

402
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,665
[Aja] I'm wearing the rainbow
kimono that Gaga wore.

403
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,234
[contestant]
Yes, bitch.

404
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,469
-Coming through.
-It's V collar.

405
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,872
[contestant]
Oh, like it's the one.

406
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,640
[Aja] I was like, can I, like,
go through your archives

407
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,041
and, like, have stuff?

408
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,677
And he was like, yeah,
take whatever you want.

409
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,247
{n8}Aja is very New York.

410
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,315
{n8}"I'm from New York.
I did this."

411
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,518
"Oh, my God,
this guy made me this."

412
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:02,688
She talks about the costume
designers and all this jazz.

413
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,891
No one cares.

414
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,227
Touch it. It's Arctic fox
dyed with saffron.

415
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,767
- Oh. My hometown look
is a Georgia peach.

416
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,104
{n8}Girl, I said, how am I gonna go
from a damn mouse to a peach?

417
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,406
I haven't seen a lot of girls

418
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:24,744
who can get some paper
and some kind of glue

419
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,381
and create a new face.

420
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,782
I may not have
the best stuff,

421
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,018
but I work with what I got,

422
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,719
and I think that's
what makes me different.

423
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,756
I just need for people
to believe in me.

424
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,496
Ladies, who wants to win
the first challenge the most?

425
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,931
-Me!
-Me!

426
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,632
-Come on, girl!
-Everybody.

427
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:47,700
Get in line, girl!

428
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,302
I'm about to storm
all you bitches.

429
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,304
Right. She gonna be
just like the candy.

430
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,939
She gonna dissolve.
Ha ha!

431
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,908
[Shea] The stakes are high
for this first challenge

432
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:59,712
because everyone is fighting
for that spotlight.

433
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,915
The true Gaga-rini,
that is what's about to go down.

434
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,920
I feel very prepared
and ready.

435
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:12,158
The only thing that I want
from this challenge

436
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,560
is to beat Trinity.

437
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,431
[applause]

438
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,469
Hello.

{n8}I have Vaseline on my teeth.

451
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,003
Ha ha!

452
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,740
And the one,
the only Lady Gaga.

453
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,609
{n8}Well, if you could do me a favor
and shoot me from the left

454
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,178
{n8}and put a filter on that camera,
would you?

455
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,814
All right, Ms. Streisand.

456
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,183
Now, to get
to know them better,

457
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:14,320
our contestants
will introduce themselves

458
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,791
wearing frocks that represent
their home cities.

459
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,127
Let the pageant begin.

[Carson] See, it's the elder care
that I relate to.

509
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,483
{n8}[RuPaul] Shea Coulee.

510
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,352
{n8}[Ross] She-brew National.

511
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,288
{n8}[Carson] Don’t be fooled
by the brats that she got.

512
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:33,125
My name's Shea Coulee
and, bitch, I'm from Chicago!

513
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,627
[all laugh]

514
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,662
Nothing reminds me of home

515
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:40,466
more than a big wiener sandwiched
in between two buns.

516
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:44,003
[Ross] The other girls
better "catch up."

517
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,905
They "must-heard" about her.

518
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,506
I want you to "relish"
this moment.

519
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,942
[all laugh]

520
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,744
Somebody stop me.

521
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,945
[laughs]

522
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,713
{n8}[RuPaul] Trinity Taylor.

523
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,751
{n8}[Ross] You must be this tall, Ru,
to take that ride.

524
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,153
I'm Trinity Taylor
from Orlando, Florida,

525
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,589
the theme park capital
of the world.

526
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,224
Want to take a ride?

527
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:07,560
[Lady Gaga] I'd take a ride
on her disco trick.

528
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:08,894
[RuPaul] Uh-huh.

529
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:10,196
{n8}Kimora Blac.

530
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,031
{n8}[Ross] Blac lives matter, y'all.

531
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,634
{n8}Hello, my name is Kimora Blac
from the city of Las Vegas.

532
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,169
All the girls in Vegas
just know me

533
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:19,705
as the youngest, hottest,
skinniest queen.

534
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,207
And if you're feeling
a little frisky,

535
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,643
whatever you do to me
stays in Vegas.

536
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,312
This message has been brought
to you by penicillin.

{n8}[RuPaul]
Up next, Jaymes Mansfield.

539
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,452
{n8}[Ross] Holy cow!

540
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,120
{n8}Hi, I'm Jaymes Mansfield.

541
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,389
I'm a <i><font color="white">tejano </font></i>living
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

542
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,658
land of beer, cheese
and serial killers.

543
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,826
Shh.

544
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,228
[all chuckle]

545
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,396
[RuPaul]
She's a dairy queen.

546
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,998
{n8}Aja.

547
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:48,167
{n8}[Carson] Make America gay again.
-Yes.

548
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:50,836
My name is Aja
and I'm from New York,

549
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,938
where people are always angry
on the streets.

550
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,907
But it's okay 'cause
you could be yourself.

551
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,809
Lady Liberty has spoken.

552
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:00,112
I wonder how many immigrants
have gone through her.

553
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,414
[all laugh]

554
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,783
{n8}[RuPaul]
Nina Bo'nina Brown.

555
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,552
{n8}She's got Georgia
on her mind.

556
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,020
{n8}And her face.

557
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,424
I am Nina Bo'nina banana fo-nana
Osama bin Laden Brown.

558
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,493
Originally from
South Kakalaki,

559
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,428
you can now catch me
in Atlanta, Georgia.

560
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,897
Take a bite of this peach.

561
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,599
[Michelle] It looks like she's got
a touch of the Zika.

562
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:24,103
-[laughs]
-Oh, my, Michelle.

563
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,740
The last thing I thought would be
brought up today is Zika.

564
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,211
[RuPaul] Welcome back
to the Miss Charisma

565
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:34,647
Uniqueness,
Nerve & Talent Pageant.

566
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,484
In this next category,

567
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,986
our contestants
return to the stage

568
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:46,625
wearing their very best
Lady Gaga drag.

569
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:48,327
First up, Peppermint.

570
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:51,263
{n8}Grammy Awards 2016.

571
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,466
{n8}[Ross] If it ain't brocade,
don't fix it.

572
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,201
[Peppermint]
"Crowd control to Major Tom,"

573
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,772
giving you Gaga/Bowie
realness.

574
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,874
Because
the entire point of drag

575
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,344
is to give the middle finger
to rules of gender.

576
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:06,812
[Lady Gaga]
I have nothing to say.

577
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,948
I'm going to be speechless
this whole time.

578
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:12,151
[RuPaul] Wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

579
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:15,888
{n8}Next up, Valentina,
the CFDA Awards.

580
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,158
{n8}That was Mugler when
Nicola Formicetti was there.

581
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,494
[Valentina] I am wearing the look
she wore for the CFDA Awards.

582
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:25,431
I definitely see myself
a bit in Lady Gaga

583
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,400
because she carries herself
with grace and glamour,

584
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,136
but I always want to add
a Latina flair to what I do.

585
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,805
[Lady Gaga] I brought
my sister as my date,

586
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,173
and we were both
on the red carpet

587
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,309
like a bunch of pissed-off
New Yorkers.

588
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,044
[Michelle] Some things
never change, darling.

589
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,413
[RuPaul]
Paparazzi love her.

590
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,684
{n8}Next up, Eureka,
the "Telephone" video.

591
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,586
{n8}Yes.

592
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,488
[Eureka] Guilty as charged.

593
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,457
I decided to do
the "Telephone" look.

594
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:54,259
I just want to give them
something big and glamorous

595
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,962
and kind of risky couture.

596
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,530
Got my titties on my chin,

597
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,300
cinch, pull and tuck, honey,
that's the D.

598
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,735
[Lady Gaga]
Great choice, darling.

599
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,937
I believe that was
Jean de Castelbajac

600
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,138
who made that garment.

601
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:09,341
[Michelle] Oh, you say that
to all the queens.

602
00:25:09,408 --> 00:25:13,012
{n8}[RuPaul] Next up, Charlie Hides,
Brit Awards 2010.

603
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,580
{n8}[Carson] That's a lace-front wig,
I believe.

604
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,415
{n8}[RuPaul] I believe it is.
[Carson] Yes.

605
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:17,583
{n8}I've chosen to wear the outfit

606
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,086
that Lady Gaga wore
for the 2010 Brit Awards.

607
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:24,056
I've done Lady Gaga
hundreds of times on YouTube,

608
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:27,326
and I think I’m pretty polished,
so I'm fairly confident.

609
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,862
Philip Treacy
made this for McQueen,

610
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,698
and he gave it to me because
I was doing a tribute to him.

611
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,601
[RuPaul] Don't be a drag,
be a McQueen.

612
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:40,205
{n8}Next up, Farrah Moan,
the "Alejandro" video.

613
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,740
{n8}Pray and slay.

614
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:44,410
{n8}[Michelle] Oh, my God,
look at her cross.

615
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:47,679
I look exactly like Lady Gaga

616
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,215
in my "Alejandro"
music video look,

617
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,317
and I'm rocking my real hair

618
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,588
and I really hope
that Lady Gaga lives for it.

619
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,590
That attitude and the face
is really good,

620
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:00,125
and the makeup is on point

621
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,795
because Steven Klein and I
had an argument about it.

622
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:03,862
I thought it was too much makeup
in this scene.

623
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,264
[Michelle]
Don't cross this queen.

624
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,533
[Ross] Everybody needs a virgin
to sacrifice.

625
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,867
[RuPaul]
Can I get an amen?

626
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:13,572
{n8}Next up, Sasha Velour,
the "Applause" video.

627
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,707
{n8}Do I have something
on my face?

628
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:16,775
[all laugh]

629
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,879
I'm wearing my favorite look
that she has ever done.

630
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:25,617
A Pierrot clown, high art,
Pat McGrath makeup.

631
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,821
It is the place
where art and pop meet.

632
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,557
[Lady Gaga] It's gonna be hard for this
not to be one of my favorites.

633
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:32,758
[Michelle] What do you live for, Gaga?

634
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,026
The applause.

635
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,461
[all laugh]

636
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,362
[RuPaul]
Painted for the Gaga.

638
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:42,434
{n8}Alexis Michelle,
the Golden Globes.

639
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,037
{n8}Best actress realness.

640
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,239
{n8}[Alexis] When I saw Gaga
at the Golden Globes in this gown,

641
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:50,576
I said she's wearing
Alexis Michelle's body.

642
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,947
So here I am body, curve,
swerve and trophies.

643
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,015
Yay!

644
00:26:58,484 --> 00:26:59,751
[Lady Gaga] Donatella Versace
made this for me.

645
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:02,454
That is not easy to
make that bodice that way.

646
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,156
Wonderful job, darling,

647
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,991
and thank you for bringing
my Globe with you.

648
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,393
[Carson] It's Ver-sayce.

649
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,062
[RuPaul]
Matching trophy.

650
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,600
{n8}Shea Coulee,
Monster Ball Tour.

651
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,068
{n8}Ross] Paws up, baby.

652
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,671
{n8}My Lady Gaga look,
it's ethereal, powerful,

653
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,940
yet gentle and serene,

654
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,676
and it mixes engineering
and fashion.

655
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,446
This reminds me of the film
that Nick Knight did

656
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:30,582
with the yellow electric
urine blonde.

657
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,817
Mmm.

658
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,086
[Carson] Urine blonde is
my screen name on Scruff.

659
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,254
[Lady Gaga] It is?
[Carson] Yes.

660
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,123
[Lady Gaga]
It's my password on Netflix.

661

00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,997
{n8}[Lady Gaga] Yes, Countess.
[Carson] Yes.

663
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,533
{n8}[Trinity]
This look speaks to me

664
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,503
because I love darkness
and glamour and vampires.

665
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,407
And Lady Gaga
was so seductive and sexy

666
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,909
and brilliant in the show.

667
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:59,945
Trinity, a little club soda
will take that right out.

668
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,315
You know, they say
that if you use your own spit,

669
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:05,684
the enzymes
break down the blood, so...

670
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,553
[RuPaul] Good to know.
[Michelle] Thank you.

671
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,788

This competition is cutthroat.

This is the Versace phase.

674
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,698
[Kimora] I'm giving a look that Gaga
wears to, like, the airport.

675
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,968
I think picking out what
she's done for red carpets

676
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,670
is so predictable

677
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,738
and it's so, like,
all right, done.

678
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,807
[Lady Gaga] Those boots,
they remind me of the pleasers

679
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,976
that I used to get
off of, um...

680
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,110
[Michelle]
Hollywood Boulevard, honey.

681
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,178
[Lady Gaga] Yep, yep.

682
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,179
[Carson]
No ifs, ands or butts about it.

683
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,381
-Uh-uh.
-No, ma'am.

684
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,818

685
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:40,752
{n8}Oh.

686
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,021
{n8}I am serving you Gaga
on the cover of <i><font color="white">Vogue.</font></i>

687
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,990
{n8}My drag is campy
and different,

688
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,360
so I'm giving you Lady Gaga
in slumberland.

689
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:49,428
I look amazing.

690
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:50,429
If they don't like this dress,

691
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,164
don't blame me,
blame Marc Jacobs.

692
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,699
[RuPaul]
Oh, she's a little sleepy.

693
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,568
[Carson] It's Marc Jacobs.
She's Marco-leptic.

694
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,037
[Lady Gaga] She's actually
not wrong, either,

695
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:01,773
because I was so tired
the day that we did that shoot

696
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,610
that that's probably what
I looked like in between shots.

697
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,380
[RuPaul] Cover girl,
put some gel in your hair.

698
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:13,051
{n8}Nina Bo'nina Brown,
VMAs 2009.

699
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,753
{n8}Oh, my God.

700
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,321
[Michelle]
Yes, McQueen, yes.

701
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:18,824
This was one of the biggest
nights of my life.

702
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,393
[Nina] I'm serving you
the black version of Lady Gaga.

703
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,962
Lot of hips, a lot of ass
and a lot of sass.

704
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,365
I can't see how Lady Gaga
is reacting

705
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,566
because I can't see anybody.

706
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:29,201
[Ross] I just love the expression
in her face

707
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,702
when she wears this outfit.

708
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,037
You know, you can tell
she's happy.

709
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,307
[RuPaul] Oh, no,
she's on the edge of whore-y.

710
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,877
{n8}Up next, Aja,
Commes des Garcons.

711
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,246
{n8}[Carson] Now, where did I
park my car?

712
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,981
[Aja] For my Lady Gaga look,

713
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:46,318
I'm wearing a remake of her
Commes des Garcons look

714
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:50,322
that she wore to show
that beauty has no shape.

715
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,657
[Lady Gaga]
You know, I wore this

716
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,592
because the media
was saying I was fat

717
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,328
and I knew this archive,
so I called Commes des Garcons

718
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,729
and I asked them
if we could wear it.

719
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,698
It's such an excellent choice.

720
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:00,799
[Ross] And very slimming.

721
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:02,234
[Lady Gaga]
It's all about the waist.

722
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,302
[Michelle] <i><font color="white">Oy, gevalt.</font></i>

723
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,504
{n8}[all laugh]

724
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:09,007
Okay, judges,
we are looking for one winner

725
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,876
who has what it takes.

726
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:11,943
Let's start with Peppermint.

727
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,046
{n8}I think Peppermint
has a fun personality.

728
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:17,616
{n8}You could tell that she likes
to take the piss with her drag,

729
00:30:17,683 --> 00:30:18,784
and I do like that.

730
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,421
I thought her Lady Liberty
was kind of basic to me.

731
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,922
Peppermint's David Bowie,

732
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,090
it would have been so great
to have the lightning bolt.

733
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,291
-On the face, yeah.
-Yeah.

734
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,061
{n8}I love when I see
the exact impression

735
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,228
and the detail in that,

736
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,264
but the adding
of the hoop earrings,

737
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,432
I didn't understand it.

738
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,666
Bowie wouldn't have
worn them that big.

739
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,968
-If he did, he would've worn one.
-One, exactly.

740
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,271
You know,
so I'm looking at detail.

741
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,273
[RuPaul] Valentina.

742
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,374
[Ross] That hometown look of hers

743
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,910
{n8}was my very favorite look
of anybody up there.

744
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,445
{n8}It was just
such a strong look,

745
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,349
and her Spanish sombrero,
East L.A. homage,

746
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,883
I thought it was super fun.

747
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,884
I thought she was beautiful

748
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,119
and I thought
the makeup was on point.

749
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:57,556
And then, the Lady Gaga look
was also super strong.

750
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,157
[Lady Gaga] Both of these looks
brought a tear to my eye.

751
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,526
Her walk was fantastic.

752
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:02,894
For me,
she was the best model.

753
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:03,895
[Michelle] Mm-hmm.
[RuPaul] Wow.

754
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,164
Eureka, that first outfit,

755
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:09,534
there was a little bit of
a used-up Tina Turner there.

756
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,136
Tina Turner away.

757
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:15,107
I was laughing and entertained
and that's part of this.

758
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,375
[Michelle]
As far as her Gaga look,

759
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,477
I thought it was fun,
it was detailed.

760
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,579
She's actually one of
my favorites of the night.

761
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,147
[RuPaul] Charlie Hides.

762
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,582
Her first look was the pilgrim.

763
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,250
I wasn't blown away
by the first look.

764
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,252
I felt like there was supposed
to be a rip-away moment

765
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,655
and it kind of just
sort of got a little mangled.

766
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,492
But the Gaga look might have
been one of my favorites.

767
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:37,129
[Lady Gaga] The detail of the way that
that lace sort of interlays,

768
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,196
it's beautifully done.

769
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,731
[RuPaul] Farrah Moan.

770
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:42,467
[Michelle] That first outfit
was definitely not Las Vegas.

771
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,469
I felt it was more like
a different version

772
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,538
of, like, <i><font color="white">Anna Karenina,</font></i>
you know.

773
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,940
<i><font color="white">Anna Karenina</font></i>
<i><font color="white">goes to Game of Thrones.</font></i>

774
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,442
Well, she does
sort of look like

775
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,644
she's in the main showroom
of the Vatican.

776
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,212
-Yes.
-[laughs]

777
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,548
[Michelle] As far as her Gaga look,
being a smaller queen,

778
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,583
she chose something
that swallowed her up,

779
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,986
and that might not have been
the best idea for a Gaga look.

780
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:04,489
[Lady Gaga] I was hoping that there
was gonna be a tear-away.

781
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,858
-Yes.
-And there wasn't.

782
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:11,663
I do have to say
I was impressed by her poise.

783
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,232
I'm wearing Poise
right now, actually.

784
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,201
Sasha Velour.

785
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,970
One too many props
can spoil a good party.

786
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,539
She was kind of cumbersomely
standing up there

787
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,040
holding these things.

788
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,643
Hey, Michelle, it's only
episode one of season nine,

789
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:26,044
and I'm already
disagreeing with you.

790
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,112
-Okay.
-Okay?

791
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,880
-Go on.
-I like more is more.

792
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,549
I like that she brought
the props.

793
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,417
She didn't waste any time
showing us who she is.

794
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,485
Too much.

795
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:34,653
If you just lose the portrait,

796
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,688
this would've been
a perfect performance.

797
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:39,057
Look at Gaga finding middle ground
for Michelle and I.

798
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,227
[Michelle] And then, "Applause,"
I thought she did well

799
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,696
and even in
that kind of flowy thing,

800
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:46,598
-it changed her persona.
-Yes.

801
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,599
Yeah, I didn't know
who it was.

802
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,601
-Right.
-And that is great drag.

803
00:32:49,668 --> 00:32:50,602
Yeah.

804
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,870
I don't think any other queen

805
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:54,706
told us exactly who she is
better than she did.

806
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,641
[RuPaul]
Alexis Michelle.

807
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,877
When you're gonna use things
like words on your body,

808
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,445
you have to be able
to read them.

809
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,613
Mm-hmm.

810
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,682
And the way they were
positioned on the bustier

811
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,016
and on the corset,
you couldn't read them.

812
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,218
The point was lost.

813
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,721
But her Gaga moment
was stunning.

814
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,023
-Yeah.
-That dress is amazing.

815
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,325
You could put Donald Trump
in that dress,

816
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,826
he's gonna look gorgeous.

817
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,863
-No.
-Now, that I don't agree.

818
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,465
The shape and the silhouette
that she achieved,

819
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:21,466
-this was really good.
-Mm-hmm.

820
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,869
This is someone to watch,
I think.

821
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,070
[RuPaul]
Shea Coulee.

822
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,072
What'd you think about
that first outfit?

823
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,508
[Carson] I thought that was really fun
and very memorable.

824
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,344
I mean, who doesn't like
a giant wiener on your head?

825
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,845
As long at it's girth-y.

826
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:36,114
And I thought
the Gaga look was great.

827
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,416
[RuPaul] That dress is just amazing.

828
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,019
The dress was actually made
by Jim Henson.

829
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,455
-Of <i><font color="white">The Muppets?</font></i>
-Yes. The original dress

830
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,925
was made in very particularly
pleated origami,

831
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,627
and it was mechanical.

832
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,629
And I felt that
some of the other girls

833
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,531
went a little further
with the detail.

834
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:56,701
Let's talk Trinity Taylor,
no relation to Rip Taylor.

835
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,903
-Oh, damn it!
-Yeah.

836
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:02,274
I thought Trinity's Orlando outfit
was kind of nondescript.

837
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,742
You wouldn't know
where she was from.

838
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,712
Now, when she turned around,
it was the kind of anal sun.

839
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:08,747
Yeah.

840
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,148
And it was kind of like,
oh, okay.

841
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,085
But her Countess Lady Gaga
drag I loved.

842
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:15,086
[RuPaul] Phenomenal.

843
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,288
I loved it from top to bottom,

844
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,924
and everybody knows
I love a bottom.

845
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,692
[Lady Gaga] That hair that she did
for the Countess

846
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,727
is so difficult to do.

847
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,196
To get that type
of smoothness

848
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:29,000
and to get the lace to lay
that flat is very hard.

849
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,036
She fucking nailed it.

850
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,338
[RuPaul]
Let's move on to Kimora Blac.

851
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,341
[Michelle] I thought the first look
was not indicative of Vegas to me.

852
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,810
It was very cheap looking.

853
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:40,045
And the Gaga look, to me,

854
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,248
it just seemed like something
you'd see in a bar.

855
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:45,250
There's no pizzazz.

856
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,719
I think she needs a moment
to get comfortable.

857
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,354
[RuPaul] Jaymes Mansfield.

858
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,855
[Ross] I love whimsy.
[RuPaul] Yeah?

859
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,290
[Ross] I thought I was being served
a comedy queen.

860
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:56,061
I was left with a little
drag blue balls with her.

861
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,096
I didn't get what I thought
I was going to get.

862
00:34:58,163 --> 00:34:59,531
Well, there's so much
you could get.

863
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,699
If you're from Milwaukee,

864
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,367
I mean, you could be
covered in cheese.

865
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,536
You could have a wig
that looks like an udder.

866
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,338
Like, you can't go halfway.

867
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,806
Right. Like,
take it to the next level.

868
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,307
Milk it. You milk it.

869
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,109
Milk it, honey, yeah.

870
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,778
What did you think
of her interpretation

871
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,480
of your <i><font color="white">Vogue </font></i>cover?

872
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:18,750
The hair is not what it was.

873
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:21,453
My bigger issue
is I think she's hiding.

874
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,422
It's about her just letting
her true self shine through.

875
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,791
[RuPaul] All right. Let's talk
about Nina Bo'nina Brown.

876
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,226
[Ross] I was so excited

877
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,461
when she walked around
the corner.

878
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,696
It's whimsical,
but it's also fabulous.

879
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:35,200
That insane peach face
with the head.

880
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:39,437
It's so twisted,
and yet it's so beautiful.

881
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:41,840
And this choice
of the McQueen,

882
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,642
she makes a statement
with each piece.

883
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,443
[RuPaul] She has
a point of view, yeah.

884
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,778
She has a point of view
as an artist.

885
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:47,812
I see a star.

886
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,414
[RuPaul]
Let's move on to Aja.

887
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,350
[Carson] I wasn't blown away
by the Statue of Liberty moment.

888
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,152
It's okay.

889
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,221
Why do you hate America,
Carson?

890
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,223
[all laugh]

891
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,459
I did love
the Commes des Garcons look,

892
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:02,560
but the makeup was real bad.

893
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,130
I don't know
that she nailed it tonight,

894
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,466
but this girl,
she's gonna keep surprising you.

895
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,603
All right. Judges,
time to fill out your scorecards

896
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,607
and bring back my girls.

897
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,743
The Florida election committee
will be verifying these results.

898
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,045
[laughs]

899
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,112
Welcome back.

900
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,814
I've combined
the judges' scores,

901
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:27,419
divided them by five
and added a 20% tip.

902
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,486
[laughs]

903
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:32,223
When I call your name,
please step forward.

904
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,795
-Eureka.
-Ooh.

905
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,764
Sasha Velour.

906
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:45,737
Nina Bo'nina Brown.

907
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,806
[gasps] Oh.

908
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:54,179
I wish you could see
the expression on your face.

909
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,413
[laughs]

910
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,049
I wish I could see
the expression on your face.

911
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:00,985
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

912
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,123
You are
our top three finalists.

913
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,592
Now, if for any reason

914
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,328
tonight's winner
cannot complete her reign,

915
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:14,666
the first and second runner-ups
will thumb wrestle

916
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,235
to determine
who takes her place.

917
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,337
[all laugh]

918
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,739
I hold in my hand

919
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:26,311
the name of Miss Charisma
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent.

920
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:31,149
Ladies and gentlemen, the winner
of a fabulous weeklong getaway

921
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,318
to The Grand Resort and Spa,

922
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:38,223
Fort Lauderdale's premiere
gay men's spa resort...

923
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,624
[inhales]

924
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:43,862
And the title of Miss Charisma
Uniqueness, Nerve & Talent...

925
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,031
The winner is...

926
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,134
Nina Bo'nina Brown.

927
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,903
-Yes!
-[applause]

928
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,538
Come on, mama.

929
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:57,509
[Nina] For them to crown me,
it means a lot to me.

930
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,311
Girl, Lady Gaga
bought my drag.

931
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:01,346
{n8}She bought it.

932
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,580
{n8}She didn't rent it
from the Netflix.

933
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:03,681
{n8}She bought it.

934
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:05,617
Validation complete.

935
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,952
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

936
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,354
I know that this is
just the beginning,

937
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:13,625
but to get you guys' approval
for this means a lot to me.

938
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,726
Thank y'all so much for this.

939
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,361
I truly appreciate it
from my heart.

940
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,564
Well, my queen, go ahead
and serve your public, honey.

941
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,032
Yeah. Come on, baby.

942
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,233
Yes.

943
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,869
Congratulations, darling.

944
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,071
[RuPaul]
Nina Bo'nina Brown!

945
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,641
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

946
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,242
Stop the music, please.

947
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:36,414
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have to apologize.

948
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,684
This is not a Steve Harvey
moment.

949
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,187
Nina, you are still our winner.

950
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,622
You are still our winner,
honey, but...

951
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:50,662
The real competition
is just about to begin.

952
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,966
I'm introducing...

953
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,937
a 14th queen into the race.

954
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,306
[Michelle gasps]
[Ross] What?

955
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,041
Who?

956
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,610
{n8}Fuck! Oh!

957
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:08,847
Breathe.

958
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:12,217
Please welcome back
to the race...

959
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,254
the 14th contestant

960
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:20,558
in the 9th season
of <i><font color="white">RuPaul's Drag Race.</font></i>

961
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:29,300
-[screams]
-Yeah!

962
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,301
Bitch!

963
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,136
Ru, are you punking us?

964
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,872
Oh, my God.

965
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,473
No fucking way.

966
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,808
