1
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:12,343
         - Aw, Jaymes.          

2
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,879
           - Oh, no,            
  the first lipstick message.   

3
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:18,581
        - I mean, Jaymes        
       was very insecure,       

4
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,849
    and she just wasn't sure    
          of herself.           

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,084
        And this is such        
  a high pressure competition,  

6
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:24,119
      you have to be sure       
          of yourself.          

7
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:25,120
          - You know,           
   the second she walked in,    

8
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:26,254
  I saw the fear in the eyes.   

9
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:28,389
       And I just saw her       
         get defeated.          

10
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:32,426
    - I honestly was really     
 surprised I was on the bottom. 

11
00:00:32,495 --> 00:00:34,494
             Like,              
    I was really surprised.     

12
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:40,433
   I'm feeling so underdogged   
  because compared to Jaymes,   

13
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:43,302
   I was like a 10 to a one.    

14
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:45,504
  - How about you, Ms. Winner?  
      How are you feeling?      

15
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:46,637
           (cheering)           

16
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,038
    - I think you admittedly    

17
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,240
    have the least amount of    
  experience of all the queens  

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,308
        and you slayed.         

19
00:00:52,377 --> 00:00:54,710
      - I'm very grateful,      
  but it's a lot of pressure.   

20
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:56,912
      So I'm very focused       

21
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,949
  to deliver to the next level  
       every single time.       

22
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,683
  - I'm really looking forward  
      to knocking you out       

23
00:01:02,752 --> 00:01:04,351
   of your winner spot, okay?   

24
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,885
          (all laugh)           

25
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:08,888
        - Yes, she's won        
     a challenge. Whatever.     

26
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:11,958
         Her confidence         
      is definitely ballsy      

27
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:13,992
    for her only doing drag     
         for 10 months.         

28
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:15,393
            - Whoo!             

29
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:17,361
       - Is the bride sad       
 to take off her wedding dress? 

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,695
         - I really am.         

31
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,730
 - I'm not mad at you for that. 
         I understand.          

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,966
  - I've been praying so hard   
   to<i> La Virgen de Guadalupe</i>    

33
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:26,435
   and I feel like she's been   
     guiding me through it.     

34
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,404
         - It's not fun         
     being the bridesmaid.      

35
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:30,972
    I want to be the bride.     

36
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,406
  I'm not here to play games.   

37
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,775
  The next challenge is mine.   

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,445
          - The winner          
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race"     

39
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,947
   receives a one-year supply

00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:44,416

           cosmetics            

41
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:48,086
        and a cash prize        
          of $100,000.

       With extra special       
          guest judges          

43
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:53,056
          Todrick Hall          
     and Cheyenne Jackson.      

44
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,491
   -  "RuPaul's Drag Race"    

45
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,758
    -  May the best woman     

46
00:01:55,827 --> 00:01:58,127
      -  Best woman win       

47
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,330
     - Here were are again.     

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,399
         - It's today.          
         - It's today.          

49
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:07,300
          (all laugh)           

50
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:08,968
          -  Ah...            

51
00:02:09,036 --> 00:02:11,904
    I'm coming off this high    
         of having won.         

52
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:15,373
 The first queen has gone home, 
      and it feels great.       

53
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:17,509
        It feels exactly        
    like I thought it would.    

54
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:21,479
    Okay, guys, after, like,    
    the gymnastic challenge,    

55
00:02:21,547 --> 00:02:22,779
        what to expect?         

56
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,480
        - I'm still sore        
       from cheerleading.       

57
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:25,748
            - Girl.             

58
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:28,016
        - So I'm hoping         
  it's not anything physical.   

59
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:30,084
    - A knitting challenge.     
          (all laugh)           

60
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:31,852
            (siren)             

61
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,486
         - Whoo, girl!          

62
00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:36,355
     She done already done      
          had herses.           

63
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,157
   - Oh, my God, oh, my God,    
          oh, my God.           

64
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:41,259
     - To become America's      
      next drag superstar,      

65
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,261
       you have to try on       
    a lot of glass slippers,    

66
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,366
     kiss a bunch of frogs,     
  but don't be an evil queen.   

67
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:51,601
           That role            
    has already been taken.     

68
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,737
          (evil laugh)          

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,910
      Hello, hello, hello.      

70
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:03,644
     (cheers and applause)      

71
00:03:03,713 --> 00:03:05,879
          - Hello, Ru.          
         - Yes, ma'am.          

72
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,147
        - Just a little         
         leopard print.         

73
00:03:07,215 --> 00:03:09,348
          - Now, what           
       do you guys think        

74
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:13,052
    of the wax figure of me     
 on loan from Madame Tussauds?  

75
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,186
          - Gorgeous.           

76
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:15,888
        - I pray to her         
      before a challenge.       

77
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:17,122
           - Really?            
            - Yeah.             

78
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,824
        - Don't you love        
        the way her eyes        

79
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:22,393
  follow you around the room?   

80
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:25,262
    It's almost like there's    
   a hidden camera in there.    

81
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,262
           - (gasps)            

82
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,231
  - Watching your every move.   

83
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,633
        Maybe there is.         

84
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,168
             - Oh!              

85
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:38,539
    - Ladies, don't let this    
 devastatingly beautiful queen  

86
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,941
       cast an evil spell       

87
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,144
       on your charisma,        
 uniqueness, nerve and talent.  

88
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,279
    Because for this week's     
        maxi challenge,         

89
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:51,451
  you need to create a totally  
  original fairytale princess.  

90
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:55,854
      - I have no problem       

91
00:03:55,923 --> 00:03:57,689
        picturing myself        
         as a princess.         

92
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,991
        I'm a jappy girl        
     who likes nice things.     

93
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,294
    - First, you'll come up     
     with a memorable name      

94
00:04:03,363 --> 00:04:05,229
        and a mythology.        

95
00:04:05,298 --> 00:04:09,199
   Then you'll need to design   
        a fantasy frock         

96
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:11,501
  to debut on the main stage.   

97
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,637
         #DragPrincess          

98
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:17,405
     And to help you bring      
  your princess story to life,  

99
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:21,608
    you'll also be creating     
       a sassy sidekick.        

100
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,909
            - Rawr.             

101
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,577
    - And you'll be playing     
          both parts.           

102
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:31,415
     - What? We have create     
       a little sidekick        

103
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:33,684
       to have our heads        
   floating by our character.   

104
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:36,853
         This is nuts.          
      Who thinks of this?       

105
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:41,290
 - So, Cinderfellas, feel free  
  to use the magical materials  

106
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,992
  from the Fabric Planet wall.  

107
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:47,895
 Gentlemen, start your engines  
  and may the best woman win.   

108
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:50,131
     (cheers and applause)      
            - Whoo!             

109
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:56,403
   - Ooh. How are you feeling   
  about this challenge, girl?   

110
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,705
      - I feel like I have      
      the new age mindset       

111
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,207
   to kind of like make this    

112
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,375
     extremely avant-garde      
       and high fashion.        

113
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,876
           - Mm-hmm.            

114
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:08,078
    - So I feel like I might    
   have this one in the bag.    

115
00:05:08,147 --> 00:05:09,312
    It's a design challenge,    

116
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:13,783
        and I sew 80%--         
 no, 95% of everything I wear,  

117
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:16,685
        so I'm known for        
   creating different looks,    

118
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:20,055
  and I feel really confident   
that this might be my challenge.

119
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,759
        - What the fuck         
          am I doing?           

120
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,994
         I do not sew.          

121
00:05:28,063 --> 00:05:32,197
    I've only made tote bags    
          and pillows.          

122
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,498
              No.               

123
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,932
        - Are you okay?         

124
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,000
      - I'm gonna just try      
 and make something mermaid-y,  

125
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,801
    something under-watery.     

126
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,236
          - I'm doing           
     under the water, too.      

127
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:42,604
    - Are you doing a fish?     

128
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,005
  - I was gonna do a mermaid,   

129
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:45,339
  but then, like, I was like,   
    there's too many people     

130
00:05:45,408 --> 00:05:47,174
  doing under the water stuff.  

131
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:49,075
            - Great.            
            - Yeah.             

132
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:50,876
           I don't--            
      Yeah, I'm terrified.      

133
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,346
       - Ooh. What's this       
   that you got here, Kimora?   

134
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:59,649
 - I'm going to be, obviously,  
      Tarzan's other wife.      

135
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,818
  - How are you feeling about   
   going into this challenge?   

136
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:04,119
   You were in the bottom two   
           last week.           

137
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:05,654
      - And you don't sew.      

138
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:07,689
           - I know.            
          I don't sew.          

139
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,256
    I like to pay designers     
       to make my stuff.        

140
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:13,327
     I'm your very spoiled      
          drag queen.           

141
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:17,331
          Would Kim K.          
    sew her own outfits? No.    

142
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:19,533
  - Well, if you pay designers  
       to do your stuff,        

143
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,467
    how much will you pay me    
    to make your challenge?     

144
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:23,969
           - I mean,            
     I have $400 right now.     

145
00:06:24,037 --> 00:06:26,704
           - I'll see           
      if I have some time.      

146
00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:27,838
         - I don't work         
        in a sweatshop.         

147
00:06:27,907 --> 00:06:29,139
           That's not           
     what I signed up for.      

148
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,141
     This is not America's      
      Next Top Sweatshop.       

149
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:34,810
  - Where you gonna put this?   
    Like, on your shoulder?     

150
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,111
      - I just got the rat      
           for show.            

151
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,912
        - Just because.         
 - I don't even really want it. 

152
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,547
        - Can I have it?        
     - Yeah, take it, girl.     

153
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,548
          - Thank you.          
  I think with this challenge,  

154
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,782
      I'm wanting to show       
      that I'm not afraid       

155
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,084
  to go in a risky direction.   

156
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:47,886
      - What is all these       
       cockroaches, girl?       

157
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,220
     - That's for my look.      

158
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:50,788
     - What are you doing?      

159
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:53,123
         - Like, sewer          
     underground princess.      

160
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:55,558
       Like, very grungy        
       and gross kind of.       

161
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:57,726
 Have, like, some kind of shit  
     growing off of my face     

162
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:00,329
   and, like, very sewer rat.   

163
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:04,131
      - I have never heard      
      of a sewage princess      

164
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,966
       in my entire life.       

165
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:07,334
     What kind of princess      
            is that?            

166
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:08,968
          Here we go.           

167
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:12,271
   Better watch out, because    
 the judges don't play around.  

168
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,505
       She could go home.       

169
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:15,139
    - Thank you for the rat.    
       - You're welcome.        

170
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:16,774
     - Come on, Templeton.      
             - Aah!             

171
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,408
         - Coming up...         

172
00:07:19,477 --> 00:07:21,844
      You came very close       
     to winning last week.      

173
00:07:21,912 --> 00:07:23,879
     - Ms. Thang, she won.      
     She better watch out.      

174
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:25,480
        Fuck that bitch!        

175
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,549
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)   

176
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:31,052
        (RuPaul laughs)         

177
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:35,054
      - What's the story?       

178
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:36,655
     - Once upon a time....     
           -  Ahh             

179
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,624
          - There was           
     a beautiful princess.      

180
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,425
     - For this challenge,      
       we have to create        

181
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,695
  a fantasy fairytale princess  
     and a sassy sidekick.      

182
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,962
      Oh, my God, Trinity,      

183
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,565
      you've never looked       
         more beautiful         

184
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:48,766
     than you do right now.     
       - You're a bitch.        

185
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,801
      You're such a bitch.      
           - (laughs)           

186
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,435
  - So what are you going for?  

187
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,070
    You're going for, like,     
         sea princess?          

188
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:56,506
           - My whole           
       Instagram branding       

189
00:07:56,575 --> 00:08:00,243
   is based on the fact that    
  I ride the subway to my gig.  

190
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,344
          - Okay, yes.          
 - So I'm Princess Subway Fish. 

191
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:05,380
   - We were given the brief    
        to come up with         

192
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,883
a mythological background story 
      for our princesses.       

193
00:08:08,952 --> 00:08:12,887
         - Introducing          
       Princess Forella.        

194
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,289
           - Someday,           
     she'll be the most...      

195
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:16,824
      What's an adjective?      

196
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:19,793
     What is an adjective?      

197
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:23,463
       Isn't an adjective       
       where you, like...       

198
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:27,032
         That's a noun.         

199
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,832
         - It's a word          
   that describes something.    

200
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:30,967
   - Like, what do you mean?    

201
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,168
      - You're beautiful.       
  "Beautiful" is an adjective.  

202
00:08:32,237 --> 00:08:33,436
         - So beautiful         
       is the adjective.        

203
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:35,237
           - Mm-hmm.            
 - I'm going to put delicious.  

204
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,338
     Is that an adjective?      

205
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,972
          Yeah, that's          
       a super adjective.       

206
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,807
  - Come on, English lessons.   

207
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,009
  - Ah, thank God I'm pretty.   

208
00:08:43,712 --> 00:08:45,745
      - Hey, kitty girls.       

209
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:47,646
             - Hey.             
            - Hello.            

210
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:50,382
   - So how are things going    
     in the magic queendom?     

211
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,882
            - Great.            
            - Good.             

212
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,284
        Hi, Farrah Moan.        
             - Ru!              

213
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:56,485
             - Ru!              
            - Rrrru!            

214
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:59,855
    - What kind of princess     
 will you be in this challenge? 

215
00:08:59,924 --> 00:09:02,457
        - She's gonna be        
    an underwater socialite.    

216
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:06,327
     She's gonna be, like,      
on all the underwater tabloids. 

217
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:07,528
          - Oh, okay.           

218
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:09,763
        Now, do you sew?        

219
00:09:09,832 --> 00:09:11,697
          - I'm smart           
    in a lot of other ways,     

220
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:16,368
  but when it comes to fabrics  
     and needles and stuff,     

221
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,069
     I'm just not as, uh...     

222
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:21,539
      uh, what's the word?      

223
00:09:21,608 --> 00:09:23,173
         - Proficient.          

224
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:24,708
      - Proficient, yeah.       

225
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,609
        - It's Season 9.        

226
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:28,978
        How do you walk         
       into the workroom        

227
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:31,246
  without knowing how to sew?   

228
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,514
        That's just sad.        

229
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:35,983
    - How will you make sure    
    that you shine through?     

230
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:40,921
  - Um...I'm just going to be   
      my cute little self       

231
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,890
        and pray to your        
    wax figurine over there     

232
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,494
      that y'all like it.       

233
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:49,696
            - Okay.             
     Can't wait to see her.     

234
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:51,865
        Thanks, Farrah.         
      - Thank you so much.      

235
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:55,334
       - Aja from the BK.       

236
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:56,835
          - Ah, Ru-Ru.          

237
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,070
  - Now, you know how to sew,   
   so you got lots of skills.   

238
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,204
             - Yes.             

239
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:02,472
          - So tell me          
      about your princess.      

240
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,841
    - Her name is Disastah.     

241
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,976
  She is a volcanic eruption,   
           basically.           

242
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,078
     She's kind of inspired     
           by my mom.           

243
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:11,046
      She's like an angry       
      Puerto Rican woman.       

244
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:12,347
           - Really.            
   - I have a tattoo of her.    

245
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,414
        It's right here.        

246
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:14,648
     - That's your mother.      
             - Yes.             

247
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:16,683
       When she got mad,        
    you see the red come up     

248
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:18,952
       and her baby hairs       
    will start crimpling up.    

249
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,220
  It's like an eruption, girl.  

250
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,355
       - Now, how are you       
          gonna shine?          

251
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,323
         - I just feel          
     so confident about it.     

252
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:27,259
I'm just like, I'm gonna do this
    and it's gonna be cute.     

253
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,594
           - You know           
    I've heard that before.     

254
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,095
       Well, I can't wait       
        to see Disastah.        

255
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,664
    I'll let you get to it.     

256
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:36,933
           Valentina.           

257
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,368
  - I'm ready for my close-up,  
          Mr. DeMille.          

258
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,037
       - Oh, my goodness.       
      Can I see your eyes?      

259
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,840
          - Um, well,           
     you see, the thing is,     

260
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:47,809
    it's my very first time     
       shaving my brows,        

261
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:49,644
  and I'm kind of like nervous  
      because I don't have      

262
00:10:49,713 --> 00:10:51,446
       my Brooke Shields        
    "Blue Lagoon" eyebrows.     

263
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,448
     - Oh! Oh, my goodness,     
         look at there.         

264
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,583
       Why don't you just       
      shave them all off?       

265
00:10:56,652 --> 00:11:00,254
- Well, because I want to still 
have a bit of boy brow to draw. 

266
00:11:00,322 --> 00:11:01,521
           - Uh-huh.            

267
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:04,256
     - So that I don't look     
       completely crazy.        

268
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:05,790
   - Why are we looking at me   
      when you said that?       

269
00:11:05,859 --> 00:11:07,526
            (laughs)            

270
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:10,995
    Okay, so I want to hear     
      about your princess.      

271
00:11:11,064 --> 00:11:12,497
    - She's an ice princess.    

272
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:15,166
  She comes from planet Azula.  

273
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:17,634
   - And that's nowhere near    
         Azusa, is it?          

274
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:20,036
      - Not anywhere near       
       Azusa, California.       

275
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,037
        - Yeah. (laughs)        

276
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:22,938
  - I have a big imagination,   

277
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,639
     and I'm really excited     
        to get started.         

278
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,941
      - See you out there.      
         - Thanks, Ru.          

279
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,876
       - Trinity Taylor.        

280
00:11:28,945 --> 00:11:30,911
          Now tell me           
      about your princess.      

281
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,911
        What's her name?        

282
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,179
      - Farella Aquapussy.      

283
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,581
      - She sounds juicy.       
           And salty.           

284
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,050
      - I kind of like it.      
          - I do, too.          

285
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:41,353
          - So tell me          
      about her sidekick.       

286
00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:44,488
      - Well, her sidekick      
    is Stanky the Starfish.     

287
00:11:44,557 --> 00:11:47,858
  And I was going to go with,   
you know, a chocolate starfish. 

288
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:49,459
           - Uh-huh.            
   - But I decided, you know,   

289
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:51,727
           kids want            
      bright colors, so...      

290
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,330
       - Kids don't know        
 they want a chocolate starfish 

291
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,165
       until they've had        
     a chocolate starfish.      

292
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:57,165
          - Oh, right.          
          - You know?           

293
00:11:57,234 --> 00:11:58,633
  - I love chocolate starfish.  

294
00:11:58,701 --> 00:12:00,467
   - Are you kidding? I live    
   for chocolate starfishes.    

295
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,736
        But this is not         
     a chocolate starfish.      

296
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:04,871
    What kind of a starfish     
            is this?            

297
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,939
    - Well, he's going to be    
      a country starfish.       

298
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:08,306
  - Like from Cracker Barrel?   

299
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,707
          (both laugh)          

300
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:12,810
    Now, you came very close    
     to winning last week.      

301
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:14,211
     Any bitterness there?      

302
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,580
      - No. I came close,       
       but you know what?       

303
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,814
   I do know that Ms. Thang,    
            she won.            

304
00:12:18,883 --> 00:12:20,249
          Even though           
     she's been doing drag      

305
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,985
   a whole lot less than me,    
     she's younger than me,     

306
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:26,521
        Fuck that bitch.        
           - (laughs)           

307
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,555
    - She better watch out.     
            - Okay.             

308
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,458
       - 'Cause Aquapussy       
           is coming.           

309
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:34,060
      - Well, I can't wait      
        to see Aquapussy        

310
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,562
   out there on that runway.    

311
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,863
           - Me, too.           

312
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:39,498
           - (laughs)           

313
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:42,133
       All right, ladies.       
  Tomorrow on the main stage,   

314
00:12:42,202 --> 00:12:45,436
       you'll be debuting       
   your fairytale princesses.   

315
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:49,007
          So good luck          
     and don't fuck it up!      

316
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:53,377
   - I don't want to do this.   

317
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:56,713
         I don't know.          
         This is hard.          

318
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:58,414
  I don't know what I'm doing.  

319
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:01,983
       I just really want       
        whatever I make         

320
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:04,286
      to look good enough       
          to be safe,           

321
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,287
         because I know         
   I'm not going to pump out    

322
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:08,388
        no award-winning        
      mermaid gown, honey.      

323
00:13:08,457 --> 00:13:10,791
     I just don't even know     
        where to begin.         

324
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,127
- Why don't you find a glue gun 
 and your bra and work on that? 

325
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:18,964
 - You know, I kind of pictured 
     gluing fabric on a bra     

326
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,465
      being a lot easier.       

327
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,435
         This is, like,         
      complicated as fuck.      

328
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,537
   Like, I don't want to have   
   to cut any piece of fabric   

329
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:27,038
     and put it over this.      

330
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,206
       - No, you're not.        

331
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,373
     - This one won't fit.      

332
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,342
  I can't get it to fit over.   
             Look.              

333
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,676
       - It's okay. Move.       

334
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,312
       Sometimes you just       
      gotta jump in, girl.      

335
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,047
       - Oh, I love you.        

336
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,783
        - I love Farrah         
      and she's my bestie,      

337
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,618
    but she literally sounds    
   like a child all the time.   

338
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,620
         It would make          
    the world of difference     

339
00:13:44,689 --> 00:13:46,855
       if she would just        
    stop bitching and do it.    

340
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:48,089
       Just do it, girl.        

341
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:49,390
        Don't be afraid         
      of hot glue, bitch.       

342
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:50,557
       You a drag queen.        

343
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:52,392
    So what I would suggest     
             you do             

344
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,394
    is, like, glue shit all     
   the way up this one side.    

345
00:13:55,463 --> 00:13:57,196
     I'm going to give you      
    this base to work with,     

346
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:59,331
       and then I'm gonna       
  let you go shell from there.  

347
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,500
          Find, like,           
  your shiny stuff, seashells.  

348
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:05,102
     - Oh, I broke a piece      
       of this starfish.        

349
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,971
            - Farrah            
   is one of those princesses   

350
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,806
   that whines all the time.    

351
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,108
          Suck it up.           
     This is a competition.     

352
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,242
     We're here to compete      
         for $100,000.          

353
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:18,112
  One minute you're in and the  
next minute, you're gone, honey.

354
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:21,047
         - Coming up...         

355
00:14:21,116 --> 00:14:24,216
    - Are you afraid of what    
   America is going to think    

356
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,917
         of your makeup         
       without face tone?       

357
00:14:25,986 --> 00:14:28,520
     - Nope, 'cause I think     
    I look almost the same.     

358
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,723
       - Awkward silence.       

359
00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:35,892
  (RuPaul laughs, bell rings)   

360
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:39,294
        (RuPaul laughs)         

361
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,496
         - Oh, my God.          

362
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:43,964
         - Get to work.         
         - Here we go.          

363
00:14:44,032 --> 00:14:45,531
       - Back here again.       

364
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,433
  - Good morning, cucu world.   

365
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,334
           - (laughs)           

366
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:51,202
    - It's elimination day.     

367
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:53,604
          I'm nervous,          
      but I'm also excited      

368
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:56,239
  about my fairytale princess   
            outfit.             

369
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:59,743
     I'm about to give them     
        Sewer Princess.         

370
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,544
    - So when you say cucu,     

371
00:15:02,613 --> 00:15:05,246
        is like the hole        
    or is it like the butt?     

372
00:15:05,315 --> 00:15:07,114
             'Cause             
     I'm a little confused.     

373
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:09,049
     - You know, it can be,     
      like, the butthole,       

374
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,916
       but let me explain       
     the story real quick.      

375
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:12,284
      When I was a child,       

376
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:15,052
      mom doesn't want us       
   to say bad words at home.    

377
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:17,721
          So one day,           
     I was three years old,     

378
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,489
    trying to tell her that     
  I need to go to the bathroom  

379
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:23,760
        'cause I need to        
   from my culo to go ca-ca.    

380
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:25,728
         She slapped me         
       with a chancleta.        

381
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:28,163
   She said, like, mira mijo,   
   let me tell you something.   

382
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:30,332
 You're not gonna say bad word  
      here in this house!       

383
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,833
    So I was, like, scared.     
    I was, like, what to do?    

384
00:15:32,902 --> 00:15:35,870
 I mean, what do you call this  
         in your back?          

385
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:40,540
       So scared one day        
     after that situation,      

386
00:15:40,609 --> 00:15:43,543
      I said, cucu, mama,       
     ca-ca, pee-pee. Okay.      

387
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,144
        And since that,         
          I say cucu.           

388
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,112
         - So do I have         
        a big cucu, too?        

389
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,480
        - Girl, you do.         

390
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:51,282
      Well, I have a cucu,      
   but you have a CuCu, girl!   

391
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,886
     - Oh, it feels so good     
   to have these brows back.    

392
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,187
        - I see you had         
        an eyebrow lift.        

393
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,723
        - Just a little.        

394
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,125
    - Are you afraid of what    
   America is going to think    

395
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,826
         of your makeup         
       without face tone?       

396
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:07,129
     - Nope, 'cause I think     
    I look almost the same.     

397
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:11,032
       - Awkward silence.       

398
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:15,102
- Everybody can get quiet, but I
think I look the same in photos.

399
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,670
       - Sometimes girls        
 that come up via social media  

400
00:16:17,739 --> 00:16:19,605
    can get a lot of praise     

401
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:23,042
        for the way they        
   present themselves online.   

402
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,709
     You got your filters.      

403
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:26,845
     You got your Facetune.     
        You got all that.       

404
00:16:26,913 --> 00:16:30,848
       However, it's how        
     you apply that makeup,     

405
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:34,518
     because sometimes when     
   people see you in person,    

406
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:36,753
   they can get a little bit    
         disappointed.          

407
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:43,225
         - So, Trinity,         
    when you were in Orlando    

408
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,628
 when that situation happened,  
  like, were you freaked out?   

409
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:48,228
            I mean,             
   I know you're from there.    

410
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,464
             Yeah.              

411
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:57,003
    - Um, I actually wasn't     
in Orlando at that very moment, 

412
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:58,638
     but I'm a very former      
          Miss Pulse.           

413
00:16:58,706 --> 00:17:00,339
           - (gasps)            

414
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,808
   - And I entertained there    
   literally the week before    

415
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:04,275
     on their Latin night,      

416
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,643
      'cause that happened      
      on their Latin night.     

417
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,310
         So it's scary          
        to think, like,         

418
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:09,379
         that literally         
      could have been me.       

419
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:12,281
       And so immediately       
        my thought is...        

420
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,648
      - Call your friends,      
           I'm sure.            

421
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:15,016
  - Oh, my God, who do I know?  

422
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,018
         - Did you lose         
   a lot of people, Trinity?    

423
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,852
     - Well, I didn't know      
       any of the people        

424
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:20,019
         that actually          
       lost their lives.        

425
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,887
         I knew several         
      of the entertainers       

426
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:25,491
      that were trapped in      
the dressing room that escaped. 

427
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,059
   A lady that I worked with    
         in my day job,         

428
00:17:27,127 --> 00:17:32,964
 one of her daughters had just  
   graduated nursing school.    

429
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,665
            And then            
   her life was taken over...   

430
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:38,168
         - Oh, my God.          
     - Like, for no reason.     

431
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:41,371
     - I'm so sorry, girl.      

432
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,973
    - Well, let me tell you     
   a story about the tragedy.   

433
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:45,407
      - I know you know--       
       you probably knew        

434
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:46,808
         a lot of them          
      because they were...      

435
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:48,676
   - June 11, I was supposed    
     to perform that night,     

436
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:50,778
   but I have to reschedule.    

437
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,948
   So Kenya Michaels, that is   
 the cast director that night,  

438
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:55,615
        she said, like,         
        it's okay, mija.        

439
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:57,783
         We can, like,          
        reschedule you.         

440
00:17:57,852 --> 00:18:01,119
    And then, like, we were     
     performing in Houston      

441
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:03,221
       and we get, like,        
       the text message.        

442
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,922
       Like, oh, my God,        
  we are here in the bathroom.  

443
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,423
     We can't do anything.      

444
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,724
   There's a guy with a gun,    
   like, shooting everybody.    

445
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:11,793
   And I'm like, oh, my God,    
        are you serious?        

446
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:14,062
      And, unfortunately,       
       one of my friends        

447
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:16,664
     died in that incident,     
            Martin.             

448
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,098
       And he was, like--       

449
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,500
            I'm like            
   two or three hours before,   

450
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:21,568
         like, Cynthia,         
        you're not here.        

451
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:22,769
        You're supposed         
        to have a show.         

452
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,636
           That's why           
      I came here tonight.      

453
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:26,304
      And I'm like, baby.       
         - Oh, Cynthia.         

454
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:28,506
         - No, no, no.          
      I just rescheduled.       

455
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,574
  Oh. Do you want to go home?   

456
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,975
        And he was like,        
       no, you know what?       

457
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,142
       I'm going to stay.       
 I'm going to have a cute time. 

458
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,410
      I miss you so much.       

459
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:35,744
           And he was           
    one of my first dancers,    

460
00:18:35,813 --> 00:18:38,280
       like, 10 years ago       
   when I started doing drag.   

461
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:42,217
   So it was a very traumatic   
    situation for everybody.    

462
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,485
      We never expect that      
      a tragedy like this       

463
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,954
    happen in our community     
     or happen in our clubs     

464
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,389
       because we thought       
     that we finally built      

465
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,958
          a safe place          
       for our community.       

466
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:54,393
       - We are not safe        
        completely yet,         

467
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:57,162
         and we're not          
       accepted 100% yet.       

468
00:18:57,231 --> 00:19:00,365
    But we have to continue     
       to live our lives.       

469
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:06,236
We can't be stuck in our houses 
 and afraid to go out and live. 

470
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:07,971
    - Preach, girl. Preach!     

471
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,640
   - What happened in Orlando   
       at Pulse Nightclub       

472
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:16,845
  was a defining and shocking   
     moment for gay people.     

473
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:19,014
       And the fact that        
   it was an act of violence    

474
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:23,518
  against LGBT people of color  
   is not insignificant here.   

475
00:19:23,587 --> 00:19:25,552
        - Family, famo.         

476
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,521
       - Love you, girls.       
           - Family.            

477
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,656
  - It's so important as queer  
 entertainers to lead the way.  

478
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:35,360
    We need to come together    
 and be proudly visibly queer.  

479
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:36,461
      - And you know what?      

480
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:37,762
           Also, drag           
      is a brilliant place      

481
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,663
        to work through         
       feelings of pain.        

482
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,097
    - Girl, drag is therapy.    

483
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,531
            - It is.            

484
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,865
   - We can't move backwards.   

485
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,100
    We need to stay strong.     

486
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,112
        (RuPaul laughs)         

487
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:05,418

   let your whole body talk    

489
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,456

  - Welcome to the main stage   
    of "RuPaul's Drag Race."    

491
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:19,229

  stepsister Michelle Visage.   

492
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,932
- Always the wicked stepsister, 
        never the bride.        

493
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,934

        Carson Kressley.        

494
00:20:26,003 --> 00:20:28,103
             Hi-ho.             
           - Hi, ho!            

495
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,505
        It's off to work        
       with the Q we go.

  glass slipper in my bedroom.  

499
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:42,215
    - It's a size 12, right?    
           - Exactly.           

500
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:46,819

503
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:54,125
     - So glad you're here.     

504
00:20:54,193 --> 00:20:55,926
           This week,           
    we challenged our queens    

505
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:59,296
    to bring their princess     
       fantasies to life,       

506
00:20:59,364 --> 00:21:02,164
          and tonight,          
they're bringing it to the ball.

       start your engines

00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,402
          Coming up...          

510
00:21:08,471 --> 00:21:11,638
         - I literally          
       had no clue at all       

511
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,507
   what was going on tonight.   

512
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:18,144
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)   

513
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,513
        (RuPaul laughs)

       Princess Cuculina.       

516
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:32,822
    - Hi, my name is Brulee.

00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,425
      I'm here to protect       
       Princess Cuculina        

518
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:38,961
      from any booty slap       

519
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,799
  and to show her that she can  
   bring peace, love and sex    

520
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:46,201
  to all the entire universe.   

521
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,806
   My advice is a happy cucu    
is one that is clean for others.

522
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,341
       - One in the pink?       

523
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,609

    is Petey the Pilot Light    

526
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:06,184
        and I'm flaming.        

527
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:13,391
 I live to help make her dream  
  of fire unsafety come true.   

528
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,060
  My advice to her is simple.   

529
00:22:16,129 --> 00:22:20,197
       Burn, baby, burn.        

530
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:21,531
             Rawr.              

531
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,932
 - Oh, it's not just her pussy  
        that's on fire.         

532
00:22:23,001 --> 00:22:25,234

       Princess Pacifica.       

534
00:22:27,705 --> 00:22:29,738
    - Well, it's the snatch     
          of the day.           

535
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,507
           - My name            
    is Fablina the blowfish.    

536
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:36,177
    I'm Princess Pacifica's     
        royal publicist.        

537
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:38,445
        When I first met        
       Princess Pacifica,       

538
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:40,547
        she was abusing         
      her royal privileges      

539
00:22:40,616 --> 00:22:43,082
 by partying from the Atlantic  
        to the Pacific.         

540
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:46,552
    I'm here to protect her     
 from the grueling sharkarazzi  

541
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:49,955
  and transform her reputation  
     from swampy socialite      

542
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:53,291
    to responsible princess     
        of the Pacific.         

543
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,228
        - Charlie Hides,        
      Princess Climaxica.       

544
00:22:57,297 --> 00:22:59,430
           - My name            
   is Isabella Snatchpacker,    

545
00:22:59,498 --> 00:23:02,199
  and I'm Princess Climaxica's  
        lady in waiting.        

546
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,033
          I first met           
       Princess Climaxica       

547
00:23:04,102 --> 00:23:07,804
when she was studying languages 
     at Galaxy University.      

548
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:10,139
       Oh, she just loves       
        foreign tongue.         

549
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:12,407
   She's a cunning linguist,    
           you know.            

550
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:16,611
  I'm here to protect her from  
 bad puns and double entendres. 

551
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,246
        How am I doing?         

552
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,914
  - Copper? I hardly know her.  
          (all laugh)           

553
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:25,018
           - Eureka,            
  Princess You-Reek-of-Daria.   

554
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:28,220
          - Here comes          
   Princess You-Reek-of-Daria   

555
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:30,056
    from the sewer kingdom.     

556
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:35,660
   I am her faithful servant    
          Woof-train.           

557
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:38,095
          The princess          
   was kicked out of topland.   

558
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:41,898
      The army banned her       
  to reign only in the sewers.  

559
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:48,638
 I live to help make her dreams 
 of being on the top a reality. 

560
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:56,011
       - Alexis Michelle,       
     Princess #SubwayFish.      

561
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,714
  - My name is #SubwayTadpole,

         chief swimmer.         

563
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,684
   We met for the first time    

564
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:08,453
    when Princess SubwayFish    
was taking the train to her gig.

565
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:12,523
  Whenever she bugging, I just  
  tell her, just keep fishing.  

566
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:13,991
   - Aw, don't be so crabby.    

567
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,359
  - There's a cream for that.   

568
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:20,462
         - Kimora Blac,         
     Princess Banana Lady.      

569
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:22,931
   - My name is Funky Monkey,   

570
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,302
  Banana Lady's cute bodyguard  
      from Banana Kingdom.      

571
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:30,404
    I am here to protect her    

572
00:24:30,473 --> 00:24:34,574
from all the big bad jungle men 
      with small bananas.       

573
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:35,875
       I love to help her       

574
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:39,745
         make her dream         
  of banana digging come true.  

575
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,813
        She is so rich,         

576
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:45,450
    she got all the bananas     
       she's ever wanted.       

577
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,586
         - Nina Bo'nina         
      Brown-Pinkett-Smith,      

578
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,622
       Princess Zathena.        

579
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,390
       - My name is Ink.        

580
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,158
    I knew Princess Zathena     

581
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,528
       back when she was        
 a little hard-headed Martian.  

582
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,264
  She was always the wild one   
         of the bunch,          

583
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,433
        wanting to breed        
      with the human race.      

584
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,236
     I'm here to teach her      
      to love who she is.       

585
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,539
    You are from the planet     
       Bad Bitch Uranium,       

586
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:13,375
    so you have to represent    
      for the bad bitches.      

587
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,910
  - I actually had a bad batch  
        of Uranium once.        

588
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:17,311
       (Michelle laughs)        

589
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,813
   I sold it to the Russians.   
     - I remember that day.     

590
00:25:19,882 --> 00:25:22,949
        - Sasha Velour,         
        Princess Uglina.        

591
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:25,718
      - Where my birds at?      
        (RuPaul laughs)         

592
00:25:25,787 --> 00:25:29,155
       - My name is Lunk        
       from Self Doubtia.       

593
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:33,392
     I'm Princess Uglina's      
       imaginary friend.        

594
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,761
            It was I            
   who trapped her in a cage,   

595
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:41,232
     filling her mind with      
    self doubt and weakness.    

596
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,702
      But Princess Uglina       
      wasn't scared of me.      

597
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,605
    She embraced my darkness    
      and showed me love,       

598
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:53,442
      so I opened the cage      
      and I set her free.       

599
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,978
         - Shea Coulee,         
       Princess Aquaria.        

600
00:25:57,047 --> 00:25:59,514
    - My name is Moon Pearl,    

601
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:04,317
       Princess Aquaria's       
     ice fairy from Uranus.     

602
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:08,554
  Princess Aquaria was born in  
the battle for love and freedom 

603
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:12,858
   when her star mother fused   
  with the Queen Moon Diamond.  

604
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:15,226
  Whenever she's feeling lost,  
          I remind her          

605
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:18,096
     that her guiding star      
          lives within          

606
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:20,898
   and that she holds the key   
         to unlock it.          

607
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:24,502
  She'll be the most sickening  
   princess in the universe.    

608
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,971
    - Why don't you come up     
    and seaweed me sometime?    

609
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,606
            No? No?             

610
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,442
   Valentina, Princess Vira.    

611
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,078
    - Where is Vira's wang?     

612
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:40,282
      - My name is Netty,       
Princess Vira's shady godmother.

613
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:41,950
             I live             
     to help make her dream     

614
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:46,521
 of freezing over the universe  
      via shade come true.      

615
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,423
      My advice is simple:      

616
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:50,325
         hate everyone.         

617
00:26:50,393 --> 00:26:53,627
            Someday             
    she'll be the shadiest,     

618
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:56,964
   most evilest queen of all    

619
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,867
            and live            
     hatefully ever after.      

620
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:04,203
   - Aja, Princess Disastah.    

621
00:27:04,272 --> 00:27:05,937
        - I almost wore         
 that same outfit today, so...  

622
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:07,505
           - Did you?           
             - Yep.             

623
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:09,907
     - My name is Dasistah,     

624
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:15,411
  and I am Princess Disastah's  
          smoke cloud.          

625
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,513
         I live to make         
      her dreams come true      

626
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:22,585
         of coal mining         
  and becoming a gold digger.   

627
00:27:22,653 --> 00:27:25,787
       Someday she'll be        
     the most ashy princess     

628
00:27:25,856 --> 00:27:29,924
        and she'll live         
     flamingly ever after.      

629
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:33,060
       - Orange you glad        
    you got fire insurance?     

630
00:27:33,129 --> 00:27:34,227
      (Michelle chuckles)       

631
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:38,531
       - Trinity Taylor,        
    Princess Aquapussy. Oh.     

632
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,033
      - Oh, surf and turf.      

633
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:43,835
           - My name            
    is Stanky the Starfish,     

634
00:27:43,904 --> 00:27:46,504
  the royal redneck counselor.  

635
00:27:46,573 --> 00:27:47,939
          We first met          

636
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:51,007
       when the princess        
  was in the waterland clinic   

637
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:53,276
    hitting her itch cream.     

638
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:56,678
    It was for her outbreak,    
           clam-idia.           

639
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:58,146
      I hope that someday       

640
00:27:58,215 --> 00:28:01,782
     she can find the cure      
         for this WTD.          

641
00:28:01,851 --> 00:28:05,986
        That stands for         
   water transmitted disease.   

642
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,889
           - (laughs)           
  Ooh, pass the tartar sauce.   

643
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,824
          (all laugh)           

644
00:28:10,893 --> 00:28:12,025
         - Coming up...         

645
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:13,826
      - I'm no seamstress,      
      but that looks like       

646
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:15,894
       a piece of fabric        
       around your waist.       

647
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,430
        - Your sidekick         
      had no personality.       

648
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,231
      - Fucking go for it.      

649
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,333
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)   

650
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:26,136
        (RuPaul laughs)         

651
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,570
       - Welcome, ladies.       

652
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,806
     When I call you name,      
      please step forward.      

653
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:35,842
     Cynthia Lee Fontaine,      
         Charlie Hides,         

654
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,645
            Eureka,             

655
00:28:38,714 --> 00:28:42,915
        Alexis Michelle,        
         Sasha Velour,          

656
00:28:42,984 --> 00:28:46,385
      Nina Bo-nina Brown,       

657
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:48,286
          Shea Coulee.          

658
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:51,857
      Ladies, you're safe.      

659
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:55,994
    You may leave the stage.    

660
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,864
     Ladies, you represent      

661
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,633
          this week's           
    beauties and the beasts.    

662
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:04,667
             - Oh.              

663
00:29:04,735 --> 00:29:06,234
          - Let's hear          
        from the judges,        

664
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:08,870
   starting with Peppermint.    

665
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:12,039
   - I just liked the way you   
created this kind of fire idea. 

666
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:14,341
      I think the details       
  on the dress are impressive.  

667
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,109
           - I loved            
     Petey the Pilot Light.     

668
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:17,543
          - Thank you.          

669
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:20,912
     When I was a teenager,     
  I was cooking at home alone   

670
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:23,214
     and the entire kitchen     
        caught on fire,         

671
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,316
  and I've been deathly afraid  
         of fire since.         

672
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,451
           So I said,           
      let me do something       

673
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,486
     that's going to tackle     
            my fear.            

674
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:32,088
           - Only you           
   can prevent grease fires.    

675
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:33,321
           - (laughs)           

676
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,190
    - Next up, Farrah Moan.     

677
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:37,658
         - Every year,          
  Ru and Michelle tell people   

678
00:29:37,727 --> 00:29:39,059
    you cannot come out here    

679
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,860
     with a piece of fabric     
   wrapped around your waist.   

680
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:42,995
     And I'm no seamstress,     
      but that looks like       

681
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:46,098
       a piece of fabric        
   wrapped around your waist.   

682
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,701
- The sidekick, the eye make-up 
     thing was distracting      

683
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,302
  'cause to me, it looked like  

684
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,238
 you were reading a script that 
 was maybe down in your hands.  

685
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:55,139
            - I was.            
           - Oh, see?           

686
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:57,842
 - I was just kind of let down  
      with the character.       

687
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:01,044
   Like, this is your chance,   
     so fucking go for it.      

688
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:03,980
    - Up next, Kimora Blac.     

689
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:05,548
            - Hello.            

690
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:08,017
  - You didn't really sell me   
   on what your princess is.    

691
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,985
            For me,             
   that was a little lacking.   

692
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,821
           - And then           
   your sidekick was robotic    

693
00:30:12,889 --> 00:30:14,822
           and really           
      had no personality.       

694
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:16,156
       - You seemed like        

695
00:30:16,225 --> 00:30:18,391
     you just couldn't wait     
      for it to get over.       

696
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,826
         - For so long,         

697
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:22,795
    I've been hiding behind     
   a breastplate and padding.   

698
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,162
        I'm pretty known        
          for my butt,          

699
00:30:24,231 --> 00:30:26,064
     and I've been padding      
          for so long           

700
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:28,232
        that I'm kind of        
      uncomfortable again.      

701
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:30,601
      And it's been hard.       

702
00:30:31,903 --> 00:30:34,036
   - Thank you, Kimora Blac.    

703
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:35,037
          - Thank you.          

704
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:37,839
     - Up next, Valentina.      

705
00:30:37,908 --> 00:30:39,340
         - I wrote down         
       Linda Evangelista.       

706
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:42,042
         The smoky eye          
  and the nude lip, I like it.  

707
00:30:42,111 --> 00:30:44,443
        (RuPaul laughs)         

708
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:46,111
         - This outfit          
      is really gorgeous,       

709
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,913
       and your sidekick,       

710
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,581
   I loved that it was about    
         shade and ice.         

711
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,117
     - Because oftentimes,      
          evil people           

712
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:55,419
  come in beautiful packages,   
      as we see every day.      

713
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,087
         - Oh, my God.          
           - (laughs)           

714
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,455
    - Thank you, Valentina.     

715
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,789
           - Gracias.           

716
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,523
        - Next up, Aja.         

717
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:06,326
         - I literally          
       had no clue at all       

718
00:31:06,395 --> 00:31:07,995
   what was going on tonight    

719
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:11,264
        with your story         
       as your princess.        

720
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,232
       - She's a volcano,       
      she's from Brooklyn,      

721
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:14,633
      she's from bad side,      
          she's banji.          

722
00:31:14,702 --> 00:31:16,034
  She's just going to the club  

723
00:31:16,103 --> 00:31:18,302
      to go hang out with       
  her little clouds and stuff.  

724
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:19,636
    - Did anybody get that?     

725
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:20,904
             - No.              
             - No.              

726
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:23,839
      I think that even if      
    you wanted to be banji,     

727
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:25,241
    there was a way to do it    

728
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:27,176
      and have it just be       
    slightly more polished.     

729
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:30,912
      - I also think that       
   your makeup is very dark.    

730
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:33,348
    - Yeah, we can't really     
         see your eyes.         

731
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:36,684
  - And it's been kind of dark  
      this whole journey.       

732
00:31:36,753 --> 00:31:39,653
   - Up next, Trinity Taylor.   

733
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:42,222
      Princess Aquapussy.       

734
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:43,489
         - When I first         
        heard your name,        

735
00:31:43,558 --> 00:31:45,591
      I just kept thinking      
        of James Bond...        

736
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,459
    (imitating Sean Connery)    
    like Princess Aquapussy.    

737
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:48,793
          (all laugh)           

738
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:50,594
          - You know,           
       I loved this look.       

739
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:52,161
         I thought that         
   from a fashion standpoint,   

740
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,930
    that this is really fun.    

741
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,564
     And then you showed us     
         your starfish.         

742
00:31:55,633 --> 00:31:56,999
         - Itch cream.          

743
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:58,166
    - You come across to me     
        as pageant girl,        

744
00:31:58,235 --> 00:32:00,669
        so seeing you do        
     something like Stanky      

745
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:03,037
     is just going to bode      
      really well for you.      

746
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:04,204
    Keeping with that comedy    

747
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:05,872
         is a good road         
      for you to go down.       

748
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:07,239
          - Thank you.          

749
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:09,642
   - Thank you, my pretties.    

750
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:10,943
  I think we've heard enough.   

751
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,278
  While you untuck backstage,   

752
00:32:13,346 --> 00:32:16,013
        the judges and I        
        will deliberate.        

753
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:20,050
  All right. Now, just between  
     us wicked stepmothers,     

754
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,520
       what do you think,       
   starting with Peppermint?    

755
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,655
      - Peppermint made me      
   very, very happy tonight.    

756
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:28,757
The minute she stepped onstage, 
 you knew what she was selling. 

757
00:32:28,826 --> 00:32:30,525
     - I love when someone      
   takes an inanimate object    

758
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:32,360
     and makes a character      
           out of it.           

759
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:35,195
   - She used something that    
  wasn't a really good memory   

760
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:37,630
   and turned it into a plus.   

761
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:38,731
           I thought            
       it was very smart.       

762
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,365
          Farrah Moan.          

763
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:43,134
  - Obviously, she's gorgeous,  
   but there was no presence.   

764
00:32:43,203 --> 00:32:45,069
          It was just           
      a huge, giant mess.       

765
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:47,704
        - Her blowfish,         
      it was a great idea,      

766
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:49,939
           but I left           
     a little unsatisfied.      

767
00:32:50,008 --> 00:32:52,241
 It just--that closed eye thing 
          didn't work.          

768
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,076
  I was more distracted by it   
    than I was entertained.     

769
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:57,345
 - I have a secret to tell you. 
            - What?             

770
00:32:57,414 --> 00:32:59,346
   - My eyes have been closed   
        the whole show.         

771
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:01,147
       (Michelle laughs)        
            - What?             

772
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:02,882
         - Kimora Blac.         

773
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,049
        - Funky Monkey.         

774
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:06,919
        It was like that        
     Teen Miss USA pageant      

775
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:09,154
  who said, most US Americans   

776
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,823
          of the Korea          
     or the South Africa...     

777
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:13,691
    - It was hard to watch,     
         I have to say.         

778
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,026
     - I think we all need      
        to take a moment        

779
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,562
         to talk about          
  the bravest struggle of all,  

780
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,665
 coming out here and telling us 
     about her struggle...      

781
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:22,899
        - Her struggle.         

782
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:23,933
  - With not wearing hip pads.  

783
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,935
    - Not wearing hip pads?     
            My God!             

784
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,771
        Can you be alive        
   and still be made a saint?   

785
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,807
       - No, but I think        
   we can make arrangements.    

786
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,208
           - (laughs)           

787
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,076
           Valentina.           

788
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,078
       - Three for three.       
 Each episode, you look at her  

789
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,446
        and we've gotten        
         to this point          

790
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:39,080
   where we can't wait to see   
      what she looks like       

791
00:33:39,149 --> 00:33:40,414
         because she's          
     so frigging beautiful,     

792
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:42,482
   we all just want to go up    
       and lick her face.       

793
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,450
    - Both of her characters    
         were stunning          

794
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,984
    as far as presentation.     

795
00:33:46,053 --> 00:33:47,151
      - And I have to say,      

796
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,619
     I was really surprised     
        with her comedy.        

797
00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:50,287
           I thought            
     she really went there.     

798
00:33:50,356 --> 00:33:51,554
             - Aja.             

799
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:53,756
     - Aja definitely chose     
        the right name:         

800
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,691
       Princess Disastah.       

801
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,091
           - (laughs)           

802
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,628
   - Because that was an epic   
     proportion earthquake.     

803
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:05,532
    - I don't understand why    
  the chaps with the volcano.   

804
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,667
      - Well, the costume       
      didn't say volcano.       

805
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:11,036
      It said Heat Miser.       

806
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:13,271
           - (laughs)           

807
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:16,907
       - She's charming,        
  but it was a hot lava mess.   

808
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:18,475
       - Trinity Taylor.        

809
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:19,909
   - I liked the whole look.    
      It's very Kooky Sue.      

810
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:23,980
 - And then Stanky the Starfish 
    was a great counterpart.    

811
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:25,314
          - Clam-idia.          

812
00:34:25,382 --> 00:34:26,981
          - It made me          
       so frigging happy.       

813
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,616
   I couldn't stop laughing.    

814
00:34:28,685 --> 00:34:31,553
   - And I also feel that she   
 interacted with her character  

815
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:33,287
            more so             
   than all the other girls.    

816
00:34:33,356 --> 00:34:35,255
    - Really, it can just be    
     summed up by one word.     

817
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,456
         - What's that?         

818
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,824
   - (imitating Sean Connery)   
           Aquapussy.           

819
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:42,227
           - Silence.           
     I've made my decision.     

820
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:46,531
      Bring back my girls.      

821
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,533
  (RuPaul laughs, bell dings)   

822
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:52,035
        (RuPaul laughs)         

823
00:34:52,104 --> 00:34:54,737
    - Welcome back, ladies.     

824
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,440
   I've made some decisions.    

825
00:34:58,575 --> 00:35:00,708
         Peppermint...          

826
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:03,410
          You're safe.          
          - Thank you.          

827
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:06,013
         - Kimora Blac.         

828
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:09,682
  The judges were not a fan of  
          your banana.          

829
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:13,486
  I'm sorry, my dear, but you   
    are up for elimination.     

830
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:17,689
  - This is the worst feeling   
         in the world.          

831
00:35:17,758 --> 00:35:20,191
   It sucks to be here again.   

832
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,825
       - Trinity Taylor.        

833
00:35:21,894 --> 00:35:25,128
   You wished upon a starfish   

834
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:27,497
   and your dreams came true.   

835
00:35:27,566 --> 00:35:29,198
       Con-drag-ulations.       

836
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:31,366
       You're the winner        
   of this week's challenge.    

837
00:35:31,435 --> 00:35:32,768
             - Aah!             
           (applause)           

838
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:37,071
- You've won a $2,000 gift card 
          from Casper.          

839
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,338
          - Thank you.          

840
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:39,572
         - You may join         
        the other girls.        

841
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:42,208
     - Girl, I finally won      
      my first challenge.       

842
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:43,476
        I have arrived,         

843
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,277
     and these other girls      
       need to watch out.       

844
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:52,650
 - Valentina, your ice princess 
        was totally hot.        

845
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,119
          You're safe.          
          - Thank you.          

846
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:58,821
         - Farrah Moan.         

847
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,489
        I hate to burst         
         your bublina,          

848
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:03,825
    but your blowfish blew.     

849
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:11,198
  Aja, the judges did not lava  
    your princess storyline.    

850
00:36:11,267 --> 00:36:14,735
    Aja, I'm sorry, my dear,    
 but you're up for elimination. 

851
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:19,538
       - I feel confused.       

852
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:20,872
   I definitely think Farrah    

853
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:23,442
  should be in the bottom two,  
            not me.             

854
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,811
  - Farrah Moan, you may join   
        the other girls.        

855
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:29,847
       - Thank you, guys.       
             (sobs)             

856
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:35,018
          - Two queens          
        stand before me.        

857
00:36:35,087 --> 00:36:39,489
Ladies, this is your last chance
         to impress me          

858
00:36:39,558 --> 00:36:43,059
       and save yourself        
       from elimination.        

859
00:36:44,862 --> 00:36:46,795
       The time has come        

860
00:36:46,864 --> 00:36:48,963
          to lip sync           

861
00:36:49,032 --> 00:36:53,467
    (echoing) for your life!    

862
00:36:53,536 --> 00:36:57,804
           Good luck,           
     and don't fuck it up.      

863
00:36:57,873 --> 00:37:00,206
         (music plays)          

864
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:07,246
       -  Doo doo doo         

865
00:37:07,314 --> 00:37:09,581
              Ah              

866
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,015
              Ah              

867
00:37:11,084 --> 00:37:13,550
         Where have all        
      the good men gone        

868
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:16,853
           And where           
      are all the gods?        

869
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:19,622
     Where's the streetwise    
           Hercules            

870
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:23,526
            To fight           
       the rising odds?        

871
00:37:23,594 --> 00:37:30,265
   Isn't there a white knight  
     upon a fiery steed?       

872
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,768
         Late at night         
      I toss and I turn        

873
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:35,837
          And I dream          
        of what I need         

874
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:37,739
        I need a hero         

875
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:41,976
   I'm holding out for a hero  
  till the end of the night    

876
00:37:42,044 --> 00:37:45,479
      He's gotta be strong     
    and he's gotta be fast     

877
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:48,114
       And he's gotta be       
     fresh from the fight      

878
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,250
        I need a hero         

879
00:37:50,318 --> 00:37:54,453
   I'm holding out for a hero  
    till the morning light     

880
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,856
       He's gotta be sure      
    and it's gotta be soon     

881
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:02,059
       And he's gotta be       
       larger than life        

882
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:05,496
     Up where the mountains    
    meet the heavens above     

883
00:38:05,565 --> 00:38:08,098
    Out where the lightning    
        splits the sea         

884
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:11,301
      I could swear there      
    is someone, somewhere      

885
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,970
         Watching me          

886
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:16,973
        Through the wind       
  and the chill and the rain   

887
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:20,109
         And the storm         
        and the flood          

888
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:24,746
    I can feel his approach    
   like a fire in my blood     

889
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:26,781
        -  Like a fire         
         in the blood          

890
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,483
           Like a fire         
         in the blood          

891
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,117
          Like a fire          
         in the blood          

892
00:38:30,186 --> 00:38:31,852
           Like a fire         
         in the blood          

893
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,255
      -  I need a hero        

894
00:38:36,324 --> 00:38:40,558
   I'm holding out for a hero  
  till the end of the night    

895
00:38:40,627 --> 00:38:43,227
        I need a hero         

896
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:46,196
     (cheers and applause)      

897
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:51,234
           - Ladies,            
     I've made my decision.     

898
00:38:57,808 --> 00:38:59,908
    Aja, shantay, you stay.     

899
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:02,042
           (applause)           

900
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,276
         - Work, girl.          

901
00:39:03,345 --> 00:39:05,511
         - You may join         
        the other girls.        

902
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,980
      - Thank you so much.      

903
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:10,081
     - You did that, bitch.     

904
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,885
         - Kimora Blac,         
  you bravely bared your soul   

905
00:39:14,954 --> 00:39:16,553
         and your ass.          

906
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:18,421
          - (chuckles)          

907
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,422
     - Stay strong, sister.     

908
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,892
        Now sashay away.        

909
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,260
        - Love you guys.        

910
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,595
         - We love you.         

911
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:29,996
     (cheers and applause)      

912
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:33,499
         - I'm pretty.          
            (laughs)            

913
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:35,468
    I'm a little surprised.     

914
00:39:35,536 --> 00:39:37,669
     It's too early for me.     

915
00:39:37,738 --> 00:39:40,805
  The judges hated my monkey.   
   I hated that monkey, too.    

916
00:39:40,874 --> 00:39:42,573
            I think             
  what I would do differently   

917
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:45,341
         is to research         
     on how to be a monkey,     

918
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,775
    'cause that is something    

919
00:39:46,844 --> 00:39:49,511
    that I would never think    
 I would do in my entire life.  

920
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,914
       But I did my best,       
     and I looked gorgeous.     

921
00:39:53,983 --> 00:39:56,784
     And I want to be known     
   as one of the pretty ones.   

922
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:02,322
      - Con-drag-ulations,      
           my queens.           

923
00:40:02,391 --> 00:40:05,291
         Now, remember,         
  if you can't love yourself,   

924
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,660
        how in the hell         
 you gonna love somebody else?  

925
00:40:07,729 --> 00:40:08,961
       Can I get an amen        
          up in here?           

926
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,462
            - Amen.             
            - Amen.             

927
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:12,864
          - All right.          
    Now, let the music play.    

928
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:17,334
  -  Everyone can be someone   
        if you want to         

929
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,536
        I can show you        

930
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:21,438
          Be someone
