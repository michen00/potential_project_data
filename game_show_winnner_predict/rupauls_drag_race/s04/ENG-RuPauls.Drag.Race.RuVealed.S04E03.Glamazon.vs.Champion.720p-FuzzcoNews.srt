<i>RuPaul's Drag Race....</i>

2
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:05,405
Hey, kitty girl.

3
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,175
The weakest out of everybody,
I would say, is Sharon Needles.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,710
Shut up!

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:15,315
(RuPaul)
Are you ready to experience
a female phenomenon?

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,050
Damn!

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,120
(Milan)
Madame LaQueer--she's not
as physical as the rest of us.

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,121
Oh!

9
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,322
[screaming]

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,425
Madame LaQueer,
Chad Michaels.

11
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,996
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

12
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:31,198
(Madame)
Oh, my God.
I feel so great.

13
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,766
I certainly actually
proved them wrong.

14
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,268
Attagirl!

15
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:37,504
The Princess...
shante, you stay.

16
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,408
Lashauwn, sashay away.

17
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,876
And tonight...

18
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,380
Music makes the people
come together.

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,582
The dolls
get a special guest...

20
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,250
- Who dat? Who dat?
- Hallelujah!

21
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,685
(RuPaul)
And testify.

22
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:52,986
All right.

23
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,888
(RuPaul)
With extra-special
guest judges

24
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,825
Natalie Cole
and <i>Glee's</i> Amber Riley.

25
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,563
I predict this will be
and unforgettable episode.

and a cash prize of $100,000.

32

And may the best woman win.

33
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:22,783
Welcome to <i>RuPaul's Drag Race:</i>
<i>Season Four RuVealed.</i>

34
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,652
Now get ready for a lip sync
that will leave you

35
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,988
kissing and pleasing
and hugging and squeezing

36
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,591
together forever
and ever and ever!

37
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,593
[laughs]

00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,261
# May the best woman,

[tires squealing]

40
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,734
- Cheesecake.
(both) Cheesecake.

41
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,102
Is it gluten-free?

42
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,172
My baby's gone!
[wailing] My baby's gone!

43
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:46,373
Aww!

44
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,175
(Latrice)
All of my girls are gone.

45
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:49,476
This is the real deal.

46
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,546
If you're not on top
of your Ps and your Qs,

47
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,780
you'll be X'd.

48
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,250
It is getting real.

49
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,119
Princess, what was it like
to lip-synch for your life?

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,387
I just had fun with it.

51
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,055
If this is the last time
I'm on the stage,

52
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,257
I'm gonna soak it up.

53
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:06,793
Being in the bottom two
was ridiculously awful.

54
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,328
(all)
Awww!

55
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,664
(Princess)
So I need to step it up
a little bit more.

56
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,633
- Peace out.
- Deuces.

57
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,901
The bitch could sew.

58
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,968
She sure could.

59
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,069
She was very talented.

60
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,572
Well, she's gone now.

61
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:21,875
Man your stations.

62
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,277
Do you think you deserve
to be in the bottom?

63
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,645
No.

64
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,779
Who do you think deserved
to be in the bottom?

65
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:26,780
Jiggly.

66
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,482
I think if I were to do it over,

67
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,217
after the comment
that you said...

68
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,085
The thing is,
Princess is very Zen.

69
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,220
She's very quiet.

70
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,656
We needed to be, like,
crazy bitches.

71
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,559
I probably would go back
and say, "Jiggly can go."

72
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,094
Now, would you just say that
because she said something, or--

73
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,096
- [bleep] yeah.
- Drama.

74
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,298
[siren blares]

75
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,933
(all) Ooh!
(RuPaul) Ooh, girl!

76
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,901
She done already
done had herses!

77
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,704
Listen up, glamazons.

78
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:54,007
America's next drag superstar
is no one-hit wonder.

79
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,579
So if you want to live forever,
you've got to be a champion.

80
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,814
And with a little bit of love,

81
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,951
even a ladyboy
can be a cover girl.

82
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:05,485
And for the record,

83
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,121
those are all available
on iTunes.

84
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,724
[laughter]

85
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:13,393
[cheers and applause]

86
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,762
Hello, hello, hello.

87
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,098
(all)
Hi!

88
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,499
[cheers]

89
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,902
Ladies, for today's
mini-challenge,

90
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,670
we're gonna do a little
something different.

91
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,473
We're gonna do something
for someone else.

92
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,343
- Oh.
- Imagine that.

93
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:30,711
Now, I love making music.

94
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,347
And I'm honored whenever anyone

95
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,383
makes an online video
of one of my songs.

96
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,152
But there's one in particular
that really moved me.

97
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,554
And I want to share it with you.

98
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,890
[RuPaul's <i>If I Dream]</i>

99
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,224
# If I dream

100
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,493
# Everything I want to be

101
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,395
# If I dream

102
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,697
# All the possibilities

103
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,199
# If you just believe

104
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,600
# In your wildest dreams

105
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,636
# It will come true

106
00:03:55,636 --> 00:04:00,040
# It will
come true #

107
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,241
That's Piyah Martell.

108
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,044
She was born
with caudal regression syndrome

109
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,313
that prevented her legs
from growing.

110
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,049
That hasn't stopped her
from dreaming big.

111
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,352
Piyah's always wanted to be
a part of <i>RuPaul's Drag Race,</i>

112
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,955
and I've invited her here today.

113
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,089
Oh, pit crew!

114
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,258
Hey, Piyah, girl!

115
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,129
- Wow!
- All right, Mama!

116
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,498
- Diva!
- Hello, my darling.

117
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,500
Mwah, mwah.

118
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,869
- [giggles]
- Now, Piyah, honey.

119
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:32,339
You were delivering such
Mariah Carey realness

120
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,640
in that video.

121
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,675
[laughter]

122
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,543
You're giving me life!

123
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:38,345
If you really do believe
in something,

124
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:40,080
you can't give up, you know?

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,316
And if you dream and dream,
one day, it can happen.

126
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,118
Piyah just went right
to my heart.

127
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,789
To see her pursuing her dreams,
it was very inspiring.

128
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,458
Our mini-challenge today
is inspired by you.

129
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,795
Ladies, Piyah has an online
following,

130
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,465
and she calls her fans
butterflies.

131
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,502
You're gonna create
a fashion-forward headpiece

132
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:04,438
that Piyah can wear
in her next video

133
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:08,075
with these colorful butterflies.

134
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:11,478
So, ladies, you need to pair up,
so pick a partner.

135
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,185
All right, so there's
an odd number of queens,

136
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:21,755
so that leaves Jiggly all alone.

137
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:25,359
Jiggly, you get to pick
which pair you'd like to join.

138
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,693
[chuckles]

139
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,430
Yes!
Get 'em, Jiggly!

140
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,598
The pretty girls.

141
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:35,335
- [laughs]
- Say it again.

142
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,570
Now, you've got 20 minutes.

143
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,205
Ready. Set.

144
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,506
- Go.
- Aww!

145
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:43,076
I guess they just
really like butterflies.

146
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,779
Run!
Give me that!

147
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,648
Ooh, yeah.

148
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,783
Oh, that's gorgeous.
Now we're cookin'.

149
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,685
Jiggly, just get that done.

150
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,588
This one's for Piyah, baby.

151
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,457
- Okay, ladies.
- Ugh, [bleep].

152
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,226
(RuPaul)
Time's up.

153
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:01,128
- You just have to hold it.
- Yeah, I know.

154
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:05,098
Let's see what you crafty
caterpillars have come up with.

155
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:10,037
The first headpiece is from
Milan and Latrice Royale.

156
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,939
The basis of making
the headdress

157
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,941
is to make sure
that you can actually wear it.

158
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,242
- Yes.
- We failed.

159
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,344
You took the words right out
of my mouth.

160
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:20,180
Sharon Needles
and Madame LaQueer.

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,382
- Yes.
- It's very royal wedding.

162
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,952
Pop a little veil on there,
and you're ready for a funeral.

163
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:26,820
[laughter]

164
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,457
From the house
of Chad Michaels and Willam,

165
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:32,226
very tasteful number there.

166
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,393
Is it fly, girl?

167
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,895
Don't be trying to mop it.

168
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:38,532
From the house of Dida Ritz
and The Princess.

169
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:42,169
I could see Mariah Carey
selling this on HSN.

170
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,237
[laughter]

171
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,706
And last and certainly
not least,

172
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:49,443
from the house of
Phi Phi O'Hara, Kenya Michaels,

173
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,712
and Jiggly Caliente,

174
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:54,715
it's a butterfly extravaganza!

175
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,083
So we wanted something
that was gonna be

176
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,918
as big and as beautiful
as her spirit

177
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,520
and represent her as a whole.

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,621
Love it.

179
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,457
So I will consult
with the client.

180
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,392
Tell me, darling.

181
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,894
Okay. All right.

182
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,397
And the winner of this
mini-challenge is...

183
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,068
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly.

184
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,670
[cheers and applause]

185
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,939
Let's see how it looks
on Piyah.

186
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,240
[growling]
Beautiful.

187
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,709
- Gorgeous.
- Ow!

188
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,912
[cheers and applause]

189
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:27,881
Piyah, your ride is here
to pick you up

190
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,483
like the queen that you are.

191
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,418
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank you.

192
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,220
- Bye, Piyah.
- Beautiful.

193
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,958
(RuPaul)
We can't wait to see
your next video.

194
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:42,296
Music makes the people
come together.

195
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,630
For this week's main challenge,

196
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,301
you'll be producing and starring
in infomercials

197
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,704
for my albums <i>Champion</i>
and <i>Glamazon.</i>

198
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:54,308
You'll need to sell each song
based on a personal memory,

199
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,477
like your first kiss
or your first time in drag.

200
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,114
Phi Phi, Kenya, and Jiggly,
you won the mini-challenge.

201
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:04,318
But, Phi Phi and Kenya,
you won the coin toss,

202
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:08,822
so you two will be
team captains.

203
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,525
Phi Phi, you are Team <i>Champion.</i>

204
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:14,728
Kenya, you're Team <i>Glamazon.</i>

205
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,296
All right, Kenya,
pick a queen.

206
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,899
Chad Michaels.

207
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:19,900
Phi Phi, your turn.

208
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,034
Sharon Needles.

209
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,369
What?

210
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,370
I'm not dumb.

211
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,705
[snickers]

212
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:26,907
Miss Willam.

213
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,342
Dida Ritz.

214
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,244
Milan.

215
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:33,413
Latrice the beast.
[growls]

216
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,415
Princess!

217
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,285
(RuPaul)
All right, two queens left,

218
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:42,089
Jiggly and Madame LaQueer.

219
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,524
Jiggly, get your butt
over here.

220
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,725
[giggling]

221
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,927
(Madame)
Again I got picked last.

222
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,296
I thought that Kenya was going
to go through for me.

223
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:53,066
(RuPaul)
And that means Madame LaQueer
is Team <i>Glamazon.</i>

224
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:55,969
- Oh.
- Going up.

225
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,839
I gave a hand.
She rejected it.

226
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,309
Even in sunny Puerto Rico,
there is shade.

227
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,677
(Madame)
So are the people
going to see

228
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,646
that the Puerto Rican girls
in the competition

229
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,014
does not help each other?

230
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,183
That's sad.
That is very sad.

231
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:23,830
Ladies, my entire recording
career is in your hands.

232
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,499
Gentlemen, start your engines,

233
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:29,036
and may the best seller win.

234
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:32,172
- [grunts]
- Oh!

235
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,874
God!

236
00:09:33,874 --> 00:09:36,043
I just felt like I was
in the team of the busted.

237
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,045
How are you gonna put it all
out there?

238
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,848
I think I just haven't been
given the opportunity.

239
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,283
Well, I don't know about that.

240
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,519
Shante, you stay.
We'll be right back.

241
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:50,137
Now where were we?
Oh, right.

242
00:09:50,137 --> 00:09:53,407
Our challenge today
is to make a infomercial

243
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,577
to sell RuPaul's albums <i>Glamazon</i>
and <i>Champion.</i>

244
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:59,347
I have a killer pimple,
and I did not know this.

245
00:09:59,347 --> 00:10:00,781
So we had to make testimonials

246
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,283
depending on which song
we were assigned.

247
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:04,719
We had to have choreographed
dance, make costumes.

248
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:06,120
Do you have any
plastic necklaces?

249
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,155
Um, I have, like,
one turquoise one.

250
00:10:08,155 --> 00:10:09,624
- You want it?
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

251
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,125
It has to be, like, darker.

252
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:13,861
Each team got assigned
a different album.

253
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,730
So we got <i>Champion.</i>

254
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,965
Are you guys gonna start
getting ready or not?

255
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:19,033
Well, do you want to start

256
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,701
doing choreography
and everything?

257
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,570
Oh, yeah, we have to do
our choreography.

258
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,972
[bleep].

259
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,542
- Girl.
- It's only a little snippet.

260
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:28,476
Have you listened to it?

261
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:32,046
Oh!

262
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:33,881
(Sharon)
It's every song off the album.

263
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,716
(Latrice)
Yeah.

264
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,618
An hour and a half
to do choreography,

265
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,487
plus do the costumes,
plus pick our pictures,

266
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,689
and memorize this song
and do a dance?

267
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:42,924
Mm-hmm.

268
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:46,127
That's why they call it
a challenge, girl.

269
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:49,664
Mm-hmm!

270
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,666
(Latrice)
Phi Phi is the team leader.

271
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,167
Definitely, there was a lot
of pressure.

272
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,969
We say the captain goes down
with the ship.

273
00:10:54,969 --> 00:10:57,338
(Phi Phi)
Do y'all's face, like,
super fast,

274
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:59,473
so that way,
we can rehearse afterwards.

275
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:00,875
Can everyone be painted
in 30 minutes?

276
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,410
- In 30?
- Mm-hmm.

277
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,278
Just put some white powder
on your face and look gothic.

278
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:05,213
That's all we need you to do.

279
00:11:08,883 --> 00:11:10,551
Phi Phi wants to call me goth

280
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:13,421
and wants to push me
into one small box,

281
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:16,724
which is a box she knows
nothing about.

282
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:19,961
I just felt like I was
in the team of the busted.

283
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,796
And I wanted to be
in the team of the dusted.

284
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:26,901
Okay, so what we need to do
is come up with a theme.

285
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,803
Maybe we try to put <i>Glamazon--</i>

286
00:11:28,803 --> 00:11:32,340
our animals, our fears, costume
to that first and--

287
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,875
Yeah, but because
of our time frame,

288
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,142
we got to make sure
that everybody

289
00:11:35,142 --> 00:11:36,410
can get something
that's universal.

290
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,212
Let's just decide to go on '80s.

291
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:41,282
I think we all knew that Kenya
had a language barrier.

292
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:46,053
So I decided to take control of
that situation and help Kenya.

293
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:47,722
We have to pick
our individual backgrounds

294
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,056
for our individual performance.

295
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,858
Okay, great.
Can you find humor in that?

296
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,426
You know what I'm saying?
Like--

297
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:54,295
- In clouds?
- Yeah.

298
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,664
Kenya is supposed to be
the team leader,

299
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:59,200
but Milan is stepping in,
and I'm sorry.

300
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,369
I don't think
it's the language barrier.

301
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:03,271
All tea, no shade!

302
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:05,873
You know, it's about this.
It's about, "Ha, ha, ha."

303
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:07,542
The first position
for the Superstar.

304
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,676
What is the first position?

305
00:12:08,676 --> 00:12:09,677
It's, um...

306
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,078
# Gonna love you

307
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:12,079
# As you are

308
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,248
And next--next--

309
00:12:14,248 --> 00:12:15,416
(Milan)
Let me sing through it.

310
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,584
I'll try to sing
as much as I can.

311
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,619
(Willam)
Milan kept talking over Kenya.

312
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:19,787
- Maybe I--
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

313
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:21,255
Hold on, hold on.

314
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:22,990
It's getting old.
It's getting real damn old.

315
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,195
Hello, hello, hello.

316
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,229
Hi, RuPaul.

317
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:29,797
(all)
Hi!

318
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:33,668
I want to know how my
infomercials are coming along.

319
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,702
Come, Mother, come.

320
00:12:34,702 --> 00:12:36,671
Well, hello, Team <i>Glamazon.</i>

321
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:37,672
- Hi, RuPaul.
- Hi, Ru.

322
00:12:37,672 --> 00:12:38,873
Hi!

323
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:41,409
Willam, what song
are you gonna do?

324
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,677
I get to do <i>Click Clack.</i>

325
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,111
And you're a shoe queen,
aren't you?

326
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,681
I brought 34 pairs of shoes.

327
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:47,849
[mouthing words]

328
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:49,917
I have some great '80s shoes.

329
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:51,285
Is the whole group
dressing '80s?

330
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:52,653
- Yes.
- Whole group.

331
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:55,223
So, Captain Kenya,
how did you decide on '80s?

332
00:12:55,223 --> 00:12:57,325
Personally speaking, I think,
as you listen to the album,

333
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:59,126
there's some '80s influence
going on.

334
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,128
We wanted to try to stay true
to the essence

335
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,763
and the influences of the album.

336
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:04,899
Kenya?
Who is in charge here?

337
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,100
Is it you or Milan?

338
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,535
- We decided to share it.
- Yeah.

339
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:09,403
(Milan)
Because, you know,
of the language barrier.

340
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:10,705
Right.

341
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:12,840
(Kenya)
I think that Milan
talked too much.

342
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,575
The English is not
my first language.

343
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:17,178
But I'm trying.

344
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:19,080
Princess, you've been known
here on the show

345
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,548
as sort of the quiet one,
the Zen one.

346
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:21,816
Right, right.

347
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,352
How are you gonna
put it all out there?

348
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:25,753
I think I just haven't been

349
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:28,089
given the opportunity
to do that.

350
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,391
Well, I don't know about that.

351
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:32,260
We've given you
a few opportunities.

352
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,495
You have an opportunity
right now to do it.

353
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:36,464
(Princess)
It just sucks to hear
that criticism...

354
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:38,432
Child, please!

355
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,902
Ain't no half-stepping
on <i>RuPaul's Drag Race!</i>

356
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:46,040
Well, well, well.
Team <i>Champion.</i>

357
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,074
(all)
Hi, Ru.

358
00:13:47,074 --> 00:13:49,110
Phi Phi, you're captain again.

359
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,945
- I am captain again.
- How'd that happen?

360
00:13:50,945 --> 00:13:53,648
- I'm just amazing.
- You are amazing.

361
00:13:53,648 --> 00:13:55,216
[giggles]

362
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:57,318
So, Sharon Needles,
what song are you gonna do?

363
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:58,886
I'm going to be doing
<i>Cover Girl.</i>

364
00:13:58,886 --> 00:14:00,421
- <i>Cover Girl?</i>
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:03,891
I'm going to be pitching it
to an alternative audience

366
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:06,661
who might think your music is,
uh, too dancy.

367
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,296
Wait a minute.
Ex-squeeze me?

368
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,232
Well, it is very dancy,
but it also, you know,

369
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:13,334
has other elements to it
that I think works

370
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,536
for all audiences.

371
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:17,104
Uh-huh.

372
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,207
Dida, what song are you doing?

373
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,276
I'm doing Stepford wife dancing
to RuPaul's <i>Main Event.</i>

374
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:23,744
And when she hears this song,

375
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:25,813
it reminds her of the fun
that she had.

376
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,281
Ah.

377
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:29,183
So maybe she was a <i>Solid Gold</i>
dancer in another life?

378
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,719
Maybe, maybe she was one of
a pole dancer back in the day.

379
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,754
[laughter]

380
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,756
Now, I'm gonna let you all
get to it, okay?

381
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:38,492
- Thank you, Ru.
- All right, bye.

382
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,595
Ladies, gather round.

383
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:44,465
Remember, you need to connect
with the TV audience.

384
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:47,635
Make 'em laugh.
Sell some product.

385
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,737
And pitch your heart out.

386
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:51,572
Oh, and one more thing.

387
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:52,940
Don't [bleep] it up!

388
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,475
- Okay.
- Amen.

389
00:14:54,475 --> 00:14:55,476
- Bye, Ru.
- Bye, Ru.

390
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,411
Bye, Ru.

391
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,780
Are you ready
to move some units?

392
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,617
- [sniffs] I'm ready.
- Action!

393
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:05,386
When I first heard RuPaul's
<i>Cover Girl--</i>

394
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:06,587
Cut!
Next.

395
00:15:06,587 --> 00:15:07,889
[RuPaul laughs]

396
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:10,258
Girl from the 6 train.

397
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:11,292
RuPaul's music...

398
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,560
Okay, I want, um,

399
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,695
a two-piece and a biscuit
and, um--oh!

400
00:15:14,695 --> 00:15:15,630
We'll be right back.

401
00:15:17,034 --> 00:15:18,769
Hi!

402
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:25,343
Here they are,
Team <i>Glamazon.</i>

403
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:27,745
The infomercial challenge
is kind of daunting

404
00:15:27,745 --> 00:15:29,780
because we're doing
lots of different segments.

405
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,516
There's different outfits
to think about.

406
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:34,418
We have props for you,
if you like.

407
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,388
There's some Iron Fist shoes
which I designed,

408
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:40,992
and the pit crew
is also included.

409
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:43,094
You just got to return 'em
when you're done.

410
00:15:43,094 --> 00:15:44,896
[laughter]

411
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,565
(Princess)
We're shooting the opening scene
of the infomercial.

412
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,535
Our team looks phenomenal
in our '80s looks.

413
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:51,936
And we are so ready to do it.

414
00:15:51,936 --> 00:15:53,538
We're gonna do amazing.

415
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:54,972
(RuPaul)
All right, here we go.

416
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:55,973
Action.

417
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:59,710
[tango music]

418
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,046
Do the line.

419
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:04,549
Do the lines.

420
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,050
Awkward!

421
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,451
Now, I know you flubbed
a little bit,

422
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:08,719
but that's okay,
that's okay.

423
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,854
Just keep on going.

424
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:10,888
Hey, Chad.

425
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,390
Is that RuPaul's <i>Glamazon?</i>

426
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,159
Oh, my God.
It takes me so far back.

427
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,961
RuPaul's music--

428
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:18,262
Oh, [bleep].

429
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:21,432
Order all your favorites
and hits now.

430
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,267
The pit crew is standing by.

431
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:26,871
Uh, you read the--
the line wrong.

432
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,073
- Yeah, it's "Order now."
- Order now.

433
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:30,975
"Get all your favorite hits.

434
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,743
The pit crew is standing by."

435
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,079
Nobody gets their line right
the first time.

436
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,515
Order now,
and other favorite hits.

437
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:39,116
The pit crew is standing by.

438
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,887
All right, who's up next?

439
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:45,957
(RuPaul)
You tell me when you're ready.

440
00:16:45,957 --> 00:16:48,860
- [sniffs] I'm ready.
- Action!

441
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,095
# Where my girls at

442
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,197
# Make your heels clap

443
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:55,399
# Where my girls at

444
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,901
# Make your heels clap

445
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:00,838
#

446
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:03,674
(RuPaul)
Milan is up next.

447
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:08,112
Before I listened to RuPaul's
<i>Superstar,</i> I was so emotional.

448
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,614
But after listening to it,

449
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:13,150
I found out that the greatest
love of all is inside of me.

450
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,653
[sudden silence]

451
00:17:15,653 --> 00:17:18,155
(RuPaul)
Yo, you know,
that's another artist, actually.

452
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:20,558
(Michelle)
I was gonna say, but you're
pitching Whitney there.

453
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:21,759
Any bitch with common sense

454
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,327
knows you don't channel
Whitney Houston

455
00:17:23,327 --> 00:17:25,263
in a RuPaul infomercial.

456
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:28,299
Thanks, Whitney.
We'll call you later.

457
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,469
- Look at you.
- She got bones.

458
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:34,071
No, these are just bones
from some, leopard--

459
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:36,140
(Michelle)
A leopardasaurus.

460
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,109
Yeah, some Roberto Cavalli
animal or something.

461
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:39,610
(Michelle)
Yes, from a yacht.

462
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,279
(RuPaul)
Yes. Love it.
All right, here we go.

463
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,280
Action!

464
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,614
# Stand up

465
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:45,082
# Light a fire up

466
00:17:45,082 --> 00:17:47,318
# A revolution

467
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:49,086
# Get your rebel on

468
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:50,588
# Oh, oh, oh

469
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:52,690
Yeah, cut!

470
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,092
All right, Team <i>Champion.</i>

471
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,460
Phi Phi O'Hara.

472
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,962
She got a 40-ounce.

473
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:00,097
Girl from the 6 train.

474
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:03,534
Now it's our team's turn
to do the infomercial

475
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:06,170
to sell RuPaul's album <i>Champion.</i>

476
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,339
And...action.

477
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,208
# And I don't care #

478
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,943
# If people stare

479
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,010
Cut.

480
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,645
Give it all you got this time.

481
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,614
And...action.

482
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:19,350
# Yeah, up on the flashlights

483
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,885
# No, don't be #

484
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:22,587
(Phi Phi)
I feel amazing
during the shoot.

485
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:25,056
Ru's laughing.
Michelle's laughing.

486
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,491
I'm giving 'em, you know,
Phi Phi fierce the house down.

487
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:30,194
# Lookin',
don't be jealous of my boogie #

488
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:31,495
(RuPaul)
Action!

489
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:34,665
When I first heard <i>Ladyboy,</i>
my madam said,

490
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:36,801
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."

491
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:39,203
Cut.
It's not what in your panties?

492
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,105
- Soy sauce.
- Oh.

493
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:42,907
(RuPaul)
Sell it.
You got to sell it, okay?

494
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,543
But that was--
that's--that's good.

495
00:18:45,543 --> 00:18:48,312
"That is not soy sauce
in your panties.

496
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:50,982
That is happy endings.
Semen."

497
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:52,083
[laughs]
Oh, my God.

498
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,619
Honey, I just flooded
my basement.

499
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,987
Action!

500
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:58,589
When I first heard
RuPaul's <i>Cover Girl,</i>

501
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,258
I was covered in blood.

502
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:02,793
I was slaughtering
a sacrificial lamb.

503
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:04,262
Cut.

504
00:19:04,262 --> 00:19:06,097
The thing here is,
if it's supposed to be funny,

505
00:19:06,097 --> 00:19:07,098
make it funny.

506
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:08,566
- Let's do one more.
- Sure.

507
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:12,103
Phi Phi told me to do
just my spooky shtick.

508
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:14,238
Shtick it to 'em, Needles.

509
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:15,706
(RuPaul)
You have one take left.

510
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,808
Make it work for you, okay?

511
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,043
Okay.

512
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:20,912
Though I may dabble
in the black arts,

513
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:24,182
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.

514
00:19:24,182 --> 00:19:26,217
(RuPaul)
Cut.

515
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:28,052
[sighs]
This is a mess.

516
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:30,521
One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,

517
00:19:30,521 --> 00:19:32,757
and <i>Main Event</i> came on
by RuPaul.

518
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:34,091
It reminds me of the main event

519
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,394
that happens in the bedroom
with my husband.

520
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:39,263
So you're making
a-a sexual innuendo there.

521
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,765
No.

522
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:42,600
I think you've got to sell that
a little bit more.

523
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,368
It reminded me
of the main event

524
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:46,804
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.

525
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:47,839
(RuPaul)
Cut.

526
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,941
I like to go as far as possible

527
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,542
and have the director
pull me back.

528
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:52,910
- Okay.
- You know?

529
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,078
Okay.

530
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:55,346
This is bad.
I'm feeling nervous.

531
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:56,981
I'm feeling scared.

532
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:59,083
I'm really screwing this up
right now in front of RuPaul.

533
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,451
It reminded me of the main event

534
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,720
that was gonna happen later on
with my husband.

535
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,655
[giggles]

536
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,191
(RuPaul)
Okay, cut.

537
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,760
We'll see you
on the flip side.

538
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,596
[alarm buzzing]

539
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,267
Rise and shine!

540
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:17,935
Your country breakfast
is ready!

541
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:22,440
All right, Mami.
Elimination day.

542
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,375
- Come on.
- No!

543
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,110
I'm so nervous about today.

544
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,411
Why are you nervous?

545
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:29,280
Because I was terrible.

546
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,282
I'm just shaking in my boots
right now

547
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,751
and preparing myself
for the worst.

548
00:20:33,751 --> 00:20:36,454
I just felt like I was working
with a whole bunch of amateurs.

549
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:40,358
Sharon's scared because now

550
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:41,926
he's in the same boat
as all of us

551
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:43,628
and he doesn't have immunity.

552
00:20:43,628 --> 00:20:45,062
And the only reason
why he's scared

553
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,664
is 'cause he didn't steal
the show.

554
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:48,399
I stole the show!

555
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:50,301
(Phi Phi)
I don't want to stress out
anymore

556
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:53,371
worrying about what Sharon
thinks of me.

557
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,640
I picked a character for her
that she can excel in.

558
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,075
She has one good character,
so she might as well use it.

559
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:59,777
Bitch, shut the [bleep] up.
This is my team.

560
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:02,547
Stir that pot!

561
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:04,582
In that video,
you looked uncomfortable.

562
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:06,184
Kind of freaked me out
a little bit.

563
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:07,818
You were extremely flat.

564
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:09,420
Did you work well
with Phi Phi?

565
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,256
She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.

566
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:14,725
Okay, guys, now it's time
to untuck for a minute.

567
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:15,660
We'll be right back.

568
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:22,305
This may be the best episode
ever!

569
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:25,342
[laughter]

570
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,110
Who ready for some runway?

571
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,881
# Cover girl put the bass
in your walk #

572
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:32,182
# Head to toe

573
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:34,551
# Let your whole body talk

574
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:37,354
# And what

575
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:39,089
[applause]

576
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,892
Do you think I look
a tad underdressed?

577
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:44,728
- Whoo!
- Michelle Visage.

578
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,762
Hi, Mama.

579
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,365
- Hi, baby. How are you?
- Great.

580
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:51,568
I can see that you're
broadcasting in stereo tonight.

581
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:53,436
- Is there any other way?
- [chuckles]

582
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:55,305
Hey, Santino.

583
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:56,740
Or--or should I say shalom?

584
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,608
Ha, ha.
Shalom.

585
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,245
How about the beautiful
and talented Amber Riley?

586
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:03,680
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

587
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,115
I'm so excited to be here.

588
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,183
We're excited to have you.

589
00:22:06,183 --> 00:22:08,151
I'm a big Gleek.

590
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:09,653
[laughs]

591
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:12,989
And nine-time
Grammy award-winning artist

592
00:22:12,989 --> 00:22:14,691
Miss Natalie Cole!

593
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:16,560
Hello, love.

594
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,196
This will be unforgettable.

595
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:21,965
- It already is.
- Good.

596
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:25,068
This week, our queens
produced and starred

597
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:28,371
in TV infomercials
to sell my greatest hits.

598
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:32,609
And tonight, they're ready
to take a spin down the runway

599
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:34,611
in platinum and gold.

600
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:36,780
Gentlemen, start your engines.

601
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,416
And may the best woman win.

602
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,686
# Welcome to the show

603
00:22:42,686 --> 00:22:44,855
London, Paris...

604
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:46,256
Milan.

605
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,757
(Santino)
<i>Solid Gold</i> dancer.

606
00:22:47,757 --> 00:22:49,359
(Michelle)
Darcel, her name was.

607
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,994
(RuPaul)
And Altovise Davis, honey.

608
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,096
(Milan)
I'm going for the gold, baby.

609
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:55,198
Jackie Joyner-Kersee
has nothing on me.

610
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:56,867
(Michelle)
She's gonna make your wishes
come true.

611
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:59,102
(Natalie)
You work it, girl. Work it.

612
00:22:59,102 --> 00:23:00,971
Hair on fleek!

613
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,372
(RuPaul)
Miss Thing.

614
00:23:02,372 --> 00:23:04,441
Ooh.

615
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:06,943
Miss Chad Michaels.

616
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:08,645
(Santino)
It's <i>Jem and the Holograms.</i>

617
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,114
(RuPaul)
Fabulous. <i>Solid Gold.</i>

618
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:13,817
(Chad)
I just had the idea
to paint my forehead gold

619
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:16,786
and really try to emulate
the Versace medallion,

620
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,288
the Medusa head.

621
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:20,657
- Live from Caesars Palace.
- Okay.

622
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,893
(Michelle)
The price of gold has just
gone up, hasn't it?

623
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:24,160
(RuPaul)
Ooh, yes, it has.

624
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,629
Wow.

625
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:28,298
Willam. Glamazon.

626
00:23:28,298 --> 00:23:29,633
(Santino)
Break these chains.

627
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,334
(RuPaul)
My goodness.

628
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:33,203
Chain, chain, chain.

629
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,071
(Willam)
My theme was
<i>Clash of the Titans,</i>

630
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,607
if <i>Clash of the Titans</i>
was set in a strip club.

631
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:39,509
(Michelle)
Oh, look, Willam's
a little cheeky tonight.

632
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:42,345
(RuPaul)
Yes, I think I could see
her pink Cadillac.

633
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:44,981
[laughter]

634
00:23:44,981 --> 00:23:48,685
All right, Sharon Needles.

635
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,086
She's Greased Lightning.

636
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,922
- Serving T-bird.
- Yes.

637
00:23:51,922 --> 00:23:54,624
(Michelle)
Cha Cha Digregorio's
got nothing on us.

638
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,526
(Sharon)
I'm not afraid
to look bizarre,

639
00:23:56,526 --> 00:23:59,296
and when I look bizarre,
I feel beautiful.

640
00:23:59,296 --> 00:24:02,532
(RuPaul)
She's serving Elvis
and Elvira.

641
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,601
She's Elvirus.

642
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:07,304
And it's contagious.

643
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:10,907
Oh, Phi Phi O'Hara.
Yes.

644
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,542
(Michelle)
Vanessa Williams right here.

645
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:13,610
(Natalie)
Yes, yes.

646
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,112
(RuPaul)
Sparkle, Phi Phi. Sparkle.

647
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:17,781
(Phi Phi)
I love my look.

648
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,083
My hair kind of looks swooped
like an ice cream cone.

649
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,651
Trying to serve the judges

650
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:25,055
Beyoncé-meets-the-Jetsons
realness.

651
00:24:25,055 --> 00:24:26,857
(RuPaul)
She's serving Jiffy Pop
after the show.

652
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:27,891
(Amber)
Okay.

653
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:30,360
(RuPaul)
Madame LaQueer.

654
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,361
(Santino)
Cut it out.

655
00:24:31,361 --> 00:24:33,463
[Michelle laughs]

656
00:24:33,463 --> 00:24:37,734
(RuPaul)
Yes, she is serving
some space couture.

657
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:39,769
Yes, Mama.

658
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,671
(Madame)
I'm going with
an outer space look,

659
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:44,941
and it's good because
I like to be different.

660
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,512
(RuPaul)
Space: the final LaQueer.

661
00:24:48,512 --> 00:24:50,080
The Princess.

662
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,281
(Santino)
Uh-oh.

663
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,849
- Wait--uh--what?
- Uh--

664
00:24:52,849 --> 00:24:54,818
She stole my look.

665
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:56,953
Gagging!

666
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,422
(Princess)
I like showing off my body,
my curves,

667
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:01,324
with an element of androgyny.

668
00:25:01,324 --> 00:25:04,227
I definitely think it's a bold
choice to go without a wig.

669
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:05,896
(Michelle)
Bold is beautiful.

670
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:07,430
(RuPaul)
Yes, it is.
Look at that ass.

671
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,932
(Natalie)
I'm telling you.

672
00:25:08,932 --> 00:25:10,767
(RuPaul)
Your ass is mince, Princess.

673
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:12,602
[Michelle laughs]

674
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:15,338
(RuPaul)
Jiggly Caliente.

675
00:25:15,338 --> 00:25:18,341
Serving heavy gunmetal chick.

676
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:21,144
(Michelle)
There's an asteroid headed
straight for planet Ru.

677
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:24,047
(RuPaul)
Uh-oh. Duck and cover.

678
00:25:24,047 --> 00:25:25,448
(Jiggly)
The look is right.

679
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:26,650
Catch my shades.

680
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,251
I look sick.

681
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:30,353
(RuPaul)
I said wild women do.

682
00:25:30,353 --> 00:25:32,522
- Amen.
[laughter]

683
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:35,859
- And they don't regret it.
- No.

684
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,127
(RuPaul)
Dida Ritz.

685
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:39,829
Oh, runway realness.

686
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,131
Supermodel.

687
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:42,132
(Dida)
Look at these legs.

688
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:43,900
I'm pummeling the runway.

689
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,970
I am serving Naomi Campbell
realness.

690
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,905
(RuPaul)
Oh, and what an impressive
bumper she has.

691
00:25:48,905 --> 00:25:51,074
(Michelle)
And she ain't afraid
to show it.

692
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:53,310
- No.
- Not at all.

693
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,545
(RuPaul)
Latrice Royale.

694
00:25:55,545 --> 00:25:58,448
There's gold
in them there hills.

695
00:25:58,448 --> 00:25:59,649
[Michelle laughs]

696
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:01,651
(Latrice)
I want this short little dress

697
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:04,921
to show off my gorgeous legs
and hips and curves.

698
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:06,690
Body beautiful, of course.

699
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,291
(Michelle)
24-karat realness.

700
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,626
(RuPaul)
Yes.

701
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,495
I'll have a Latrice Royale
on the rocks.

702
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:14,397
Shaken, not stirred.

703
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,733
Kenya Michaels.

704
00:26:16,733 --> 00:26:19,769
She's serving
some R2-D2 realness.

705
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,271
"C-3P-ho."

706
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:24,508
(Kenya)
I tried to mix the high couture
with the fantasy.

707
00:26:24,508 --> 00:26:26,543
I feel amazing.

708
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,546
(RuPaul)
In space, no one can hear you,
queen.

709
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,548
[Michelle laughs]

710
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,385
Welcome, ladies.

711
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:39,489
It's time to debut your
RuCo Records infomercials.

712
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:41,057
I am so excited.

713
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:43,126
Team <i>Glamazon.</i>

714
00:26:43,126 --> 00:26:44,160
# Do it, do it

715
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,161
# Oh

716
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:46,196
Hey, Chad.

717
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:47,697
Is that RuPaul's <i>Glamazon?</i>

718
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:49,065
Like, oh, my God, wow.

719
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,101
That takes me so far back.

720
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:54,070
RuPaul's music brings back
so many good memories.

721
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,972
It's hard to choose just one.

722
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:57,107
You know what, Princess?

723
00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:59,242
Luckily, you don't have to.

724
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,944
Oh, my God!

725
00:27:00,944 --> 00:27:02,245
# Gonna love you

726
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,847
# As you are

727
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:05,615
Before I listened
to <i>Superstar,</i>

728
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,751
I was totally spastic.

729
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,554
But now that I listened to it,
I feel totally tubular.

730
00:27:10,554 --> 00:27:13,089
# As you are

731
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,357
[Hispanic accent]
Hello, Papi.

732
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:16,326
I don't speak very much English.

733
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:20,564
[speaking Spanish]

734
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:22,032
<i>Y</i> trust me.

735
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,835
Do you remember your first time?

736
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,403
# We are all stars

737
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:27,671
# That was then

738
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:29,239
Oh, my God, you guys.

739
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,675
The first time I heard
RuPaul's song <i>The Beginning,</i>

740
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:33,476
I was spray-painting
my ex-boyfriend's car

741
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:34,744
with vulgarities.

742
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:35,879
What a jerk.

743
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,314
That was the beginning
of an awesome

744
00:27:37,314 --> 00:27:39,482
and gnarly new life for me.

745
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:42,052
# Every day

746
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:43,854
# Light a fire up

747
00:27:43,854 --> 00:27:46,656
When you are in a competition
that no one speaks Spanish,

748
00:27:46,656 --> 00:27:49,059
you think, "[bleep],
<i>no entiendo nada."</i>

749
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:51,461
But in that moment,
awake the beast.

750
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,697
Get your rebel on, and fight.

751
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:55,565
# Get your rebel on

752
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:57,100
# Everybody, everybody

753
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,368
# Do you hear that

754
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,470
Wearing high heels
was getting so ho-hum

755
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,539
until I heard <i>Click Clack.</i>

756
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,641
Now it's the soundtrack
to my life.

757
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,278
# If I dream

758
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:10,580
Do you feel like you've come
to the end of your road?

759
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,482
At one time, I did too,

760
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,085
until I heard
RuPaul's <i>If I Dream.</i>

761
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:17,721
And now I know anything
is possible.

762
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:19,322
# They will come true

763
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,592
# They will
come true #

764
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:24,194
# We gonna work that sexy

767
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,132
The pit crew is standing by.

Get <i>Glamazon</i> on Amazon!

769
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:33,370

Ahh!

[Valley girl voice]
Oh, my God, you guys.

773
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:43,847
Gag me with a spoon.

774
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,283
If I had a nickel.

775
00:28:46,283 --> 00:28:48,118
(Princess)
Perfect. Awesome.

776
00:28:48,118 --> 00:28:50,320
I don't think we could've done
anything better.

777
00:28:52,489 --> 00:28:53,723
I don't like the outfit.

778
00:28:53,723 --> 00:28:55,425
There's something a little tacky
about it.

779
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,793
It reminds me of fungus.

780
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,261
What'd you just call me?

781
00:28:58,261 --> 00:29:01,231
...reach the top
of the charts.

782
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,632
We'll be right back.

783
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:05,670
Hey, we're back! But weren't
those commercials great?

784
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,540
The infomercial
for Team <i>Champion.</i>

785
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,177
[upbeat dance music]

786
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,979
Hey, Vampira.

787
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:15,547
Isn't this, like, this, like,

788
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:19,217
uh, RuPaul <i>Champion</i> album
or somethin'?

789
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,954
Oh, RuPaul's music
always brings me back.

790
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:24,389
You know what, girl?

791
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:26,157
Like, there's so many songs

792
00:29:26,157 --> 00:29:28,460
that, like, have so many
good memories

793
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,029
that it's hard to, like,
pick one, you know, Mamas?

794
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:34,566
Luckily, now we don't have to.

795
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:35,834
[laughs wickedly]

796
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:37,769
# Ladyboy, lady girl

797
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,104
# This is for my girls

798
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:42,541
When I first heard <i>Ladyboy,</i>
my madam said,

799
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:45,177
"That's not soy sauce
in your panties."

800
00:29:45,177 --> 00:29:47,445
# Little ladyboys and girls

801
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,247
# Little lady, ladyboys

802
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:52,684
# You know the world
don't have to end #

803
00:29:52,684 --> 00:29:57,022
One day, I was home making
a warm apple pie for my husband,

804
00:29:57,022 --> 00:29:59,224
and then <i>Main Event</i> came on
by RuPaul.

805
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:00,592
It reminded me of the main event

806
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,594
that I was gonna get later
with my husband.

807
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:06,131
# Dancing to your soul

808
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:09,534
Children, when I heard RuPaul's
<i>Never Go Home Again,</i>

809
00:30:09,534 --> 00:30:12,737
I know that there was something
out there better waiting for me.

810
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:16,174
# Always in your heart

811
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,409
# Turn it up

812
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:18,610
So look.

813
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,579
Every time I'm walking
down the street,

814
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:24,382
all these mamisare like, "Ooh,
girl, your ass is too fat."

815
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:27,485
I'm like, "Look, don't be
jealous of my boogie."

816
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:29,521
# You can say
that you are not #

817
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:31,656
# But I always
see you looking #

818
00:30:31,656 --> 00:30:34,626
# Stroll down the runway

819
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:38,263
When I heard RuPaul's
<i>Cover Girl</i> for the first time,

820
00:30:38,263 --> 00:30:39,798
I was covered in blood.

821
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:42,334
And though I may dabble
in the black arts,

822
00:30:42,334 --> 00:30:46,872
when I hear RuPaul's music,
I see the light.

823
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:48,406
# Cover girl

00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:50,475

If I were watching back at home,

835
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:16,935
I would place my order

You produced
your infomercials as teams.

840

as individuals.

to face the music.

Hello. Hola.

00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,360
Let's go to Natalie Cole.

859
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,729
I love your essence.

860
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:21,399
But I don't like the outfit.

861
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:26,204
When I hear gold and platinum,
I think classier.

862
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:28,874
The color green reminds me
of fungus.

863
00:32:28,874 --> 00:32:30,942
In the video in the pitch,

864
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,744
little bit too much Spanish,
so remember that.

865
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:34,346
I think you were being true
to yourself, though,

866
00:32:34,346 --> 00:32:35,514
with the Spanish.

867
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,449
- It was really funny.
- Thank you.

868
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:39,251
But I think that that's a place
where you're comfortable.

869
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,820
I would encourage you to kind
of push yourself a little bit.

870
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,524
- Next up, Chad Michaels.
- Hi, Ru.

I think you're
an amazing actress.

872
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,096
I thought it was just
the right amount of trashy,

873
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,464
tongue-in-cheek.

874
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:54,599
You do everything flawlessly
from beginning to end.

875
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,867
It's obvious.

00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:59,704
I want to see you let go
of that perfection.

877
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:03,341
I want to see more
of who you are.

878
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:05,544
Princess.
Love the look.

879
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:06,545
Thank you.

880
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:08,280
Le duh!

881
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,616
...really at the same level
as Chad Michaels'.

882
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:13,919
You were extremely flat.

883
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,520
We've told this to you before.

884
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,689
You've got to be aware
of going above and beyond

885
00:33:17,689 --> 00:33:19,658
and out of your comfort zone.

886
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:22,761
You in particular, Princess.

887
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:23,962
Kenya Michaels.

888
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,363
Hi.

889
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:27,832
You come out here
in this directional ensemble.

890
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:30,235
I was just, like,
following every curve.

891
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:33,104
I really loved
your performance.

892
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,340
It was so sick
that it was right.

893
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,608
(RuPaul)
Thanks, Kenya.

894
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:37,676
Dida Ritz.

895
00:33:37,676 --> 00:33:38,944
(Santino)
Hey, Dida.

896
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:40,579
I love your ensemble tonight.

897
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:43,081
Your body is amazing.

898
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,083
I wondered why you chose

899
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,686
the character you played
in the video.

900
00:33:47,686 --> 00:33:49,254
(Dida)
I wanted to do
something different.

901
00:33:49,254 --> 00:33:51,623
Tall, leggy, sexy Dida
is kind of something

902
00:33:51,623 --> 00:33:53,825
that I don't want
to get comfortable doing.

903
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,493
It's good that you did
take a risk,

904
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:57,696
but you looked uncomfortable,
and if you're gonna

905
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,464
do something out of your
comfort zone,

906
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:01,233
you have to commit to it.

907
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:03,301
The plot thickens.

908
00:34:03,301 --> 00:34:05,270
Next up, Sharon Needles.

909
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,573
Tell me about your
infomercial presentation.

910
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:10,408
Did you work well with Phi Phi?

911
00:34:10,408 --> 00:34:13,678
She definitely didn't bring
a strong leadership role.

912
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,146
Basically, what she said is,
"You're spooky.

913
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:16,481
Dress like a monster."

914
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:19,150
But I used it as a way
to sell your records.

915
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,086
Well, you do spooky very well.

916
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,854
- Boo.
- [whimpering]

917
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:24,656
I didn't even get
the name right away.

918
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:26,124
[laughter]

919
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:27,626
It just went whoop,
right over my head.

920
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:29,294
All in the past, Miss Cole.

921
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:30,829
Okay.

922
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:32,130
You know, so I'm right there
with you, but anyway.

923
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,065
- Well, yes, um--
- [laughs]

924
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:36,234
The presentation was eerie

925
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:38,203
and all that you wanted it
to be.

926
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,671
It kind of freaked me out
a little bit.

927
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:41,439
I really liked it.

928
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:44,109
(Santino)
I love that Swarovski crystal
pompadour you got on.

929
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,212
But I wish I couldn't see
the lower half of your body.

930
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:51,550
It kind of looks like
a store-bought thing.

931
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,585
(RuPaul)
Well, ladies, I think
we've heard enough.

932
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:55,720
While you enjoy
an Absolut cocktail

933
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,956
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

934
00:34:57,956 --> 00:35:00,192
the judges and I
will deliberate.

935
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:03,061
You may leave the stage.

936
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:07,599
All right, just between
us girls, who is your favorite?

937
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,202
- I go with personality.
- Yeah.

938
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:12,838
(Natalie)
I think that Sharon Needles
has got a great sense of humor.

939
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:14,039
(RuPaul)
Uh-huh.

940
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,473
For me, it's between
Sharon Needles

941
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:16,775
and Kenya Michaels.

942
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:18,176
I really like Kenya.

943
00:35:18,176 --> 00:35:22,614
She has less of a handle
on the English language,

944
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:25,517
but she was able to just
push through it

945
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:26,551
and just have fun.

946
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:28,353
Yes.
She sold it.

947
00:35:28,353 --> 00:35:29,688
It was from the heart.

948
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:32,224
You felt that she wanted
to bring out the inner beast

949
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,458
and get her rebel on.

950
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,093
Chad is my absolute favorite.

951
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:38,163
She's so glam and so seasoned.

952
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:39,397
I couldn't keep my eyes off her.

953
00:35:39,397 --> 00:35:40,899
I just kept staring at her
the whole time.

954
00:35:40,899 --> 00:35:41,900
(RuPaul)
Okay.

955
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,934
Now, here is the hard part.

956
00:35:42,934 --> 00:35:46,071
Who are the bottom two?

957
00:35:46,071 --> 00:35:48,240
You know,
I would kind of have to say

958
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,408
Princess and Madame LaQueer.

959
00:35:50,408 --> 00:35:52,277
Princess and Madame LaQueer.
And why?

960
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:56,081
(Natalie)
Madame LaQueer, she's just
not quite ready for prime time.

961
00:35:56,081 --> 00:35:59,084
And although Miss Princess' look
is great,

962
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:01,686
we're talking about bringing
people that are gonna win...

963
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:02,854
Yes.

964
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,422
Because they're already
so close.

965
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:06,124
I don't think she's that close.

966
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,293
The Princess--I'm getting
nothing from her.

967
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,695
I think I'd like to see more
from Madame LaQueer.

968
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:12,297
- She's a fierce queen.
- Yeah.

969
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,099
I'm gonna have to say Dida.

970
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,700
I just don't know.

971
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,702
I'm confused by her 'cause
the walk on the runway--

972
00:36:17,702 --> 00:36:20,438
That walk is saying,
"I am here. I am fierce."

973
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:22,040
But the video--

974
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,042
I think Dida thought
that the costume

975
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:25,277
was gonna do the work for her.

976
00:36:25,277 --> 00:36:27,479
Right, I don't think
she understands

977
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:30,048
that that walk that she displays
on the runway

978
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:32,651
can be transferred
into every challenge,

979
00:36:32,651 --> 00:36:33,919
into her everyday life.

980
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:36,221
I like to see people
who are the [bleep]

981
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,956
and know they're the [bleep].

982
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:40,559
No apologies.
No apologies.

983
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,061
All right.
Silence!

984
00:36:43,061 --> 00:36:44,696
I've made my decision.

985
00:36:44,696 --> 00:36:46,531
Bring back...

986
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,767
my girls.

987
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,635
An epic lip sync
coming up next.

988
00:36:53,034 --> 00:36:54,169
[laughs]

989
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:55,604
[suspenseful music]

990
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:56,872
(RuPaul)
Welcome back, ladies.

991
00:36:56,872 --> 00:36:58,406
I've made some decisions.

992
00:36:58,406 --> 00:37:01,843
#

993
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:03,845
Sharon Needles.

994
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:06,181
You went to the dark side...

995
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:08,083
again...

996
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:12,888
and delivered another
sparkling performance.

997
00:37:12,888 --> 00:37:14,589
- Condragulations.
- Yes!

998
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:17,092
(RuPaul)
You're the winner
of this challenge.

999
00:37:17,092 --> 00:37:18,527
Attagirl.

1000
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,263
(RuPaul)
And you'll receive
costume jewelry

1001
00:37:21,263 --> 00:37:25,200
courtesy of
fiercedragjewels.com.

1002
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,102
Who won the main challenge
this week?

1003
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:28,703
Oh, yeah, me.

1004
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:29,704
Again.

1005
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:31,640
Like a nightmare come true.

1006
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,875
Slay!

1007
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,243
I'm just such a loser back home.

1008
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:37,012
It's--or that's
how I'm perceived,

1009
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,713
and it's just great
to hear you say that.

1010
00:37:38,713 --> 00:37:40,081
Thanks.

1011
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:42,751
Sharon, you may step
to the back of the stage.

1012
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:45,520
Thank you.

1013
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,424
Chad Michaels, Kenya Michaels,
you're safe.

1014
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:51,660
#

1015
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,461
Madame LaQueer...

1016
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:59,067
#

1017
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:01,770
You're safe.

1018
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:07,342
#

1019
00:38:07,342 --> 00:38:08,844
Dida Ritz.

1020
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:10,879
The Princess.

1021
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,581
I'm sorry, my dears,

1022
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,952
but you are both up
for elimination.

1023
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,386
Not again.

1024
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:19,888
It's kind of upsetting

1025
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:22,190
because I felt like
I put myself there.

1026
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,559
(RuPaul)
Two queens stand before me.

1027
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:28,263
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1028
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:33,101
and save yourself
from elimination.

1029
00:38:33,101 --> 00:38:35,203
The time has come...

1030
00:38:35,203 --> 00:38:38,940
for you to lip-synch
for your life.

1031
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,510
Watch and learn.

1032
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,111
Good luck.

1033
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,514
And don't [bleep] it up.

1034
00:38:45,514 --> 00:38:48,517
<i>[This Will Be</i> playing]

1035
00:38:48,517 --> 00:38:50,652
This will be
an epic lip sync.

Natalie Cole is sitting
right in front of me.

1050
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:18,380
I have to do it for her.

1051
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,549
I don't want her to leave
saying,

1052
00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:23,084
"That drag queen did
a horrible job with my song."

1053
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:24,319
# You've given me #

1054
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,221
# The thrill of a lifetime

1055
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:27,556
# And made me believe

1056
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:28,924
# You've got more thrills #

1057
00:39:28,924 --> 00:39:30,725
# To spare, oh

1058
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,694
# This will be

1059
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:35,330
# An everlasting love

1060
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,132
# Oh, yes, it will, now

1061
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:38,133
[laughs]

1062
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,334
# This will be

1063
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:40,335
(Natalie)
Yeah!

1064
00:39:40,335 --> 00:39:41,503
# You and me

1065
00:39:41,503 --> 00:39:43,104
- Come on!
- # Yes, sirree

1066
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,105
Well!

1067
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:45,273
# Eternally

1068
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:46,341
# So long as I'm living #

1069
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:47,542
# True love I'll be giving #

1070
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:48,677
# To you I'll be serving #

1071
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,644
# 'Cause you're so deserving #

1072
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:50,645
Ah!

1073
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:52,581
# You're so deserving #

1074
00:39:52,581 --> 00:39:53,582
# You're so deserving, yeah #

1075
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:54,583
Whoo!

1076
00:39:54,583 --> 00:39:55,617
# Yeah, yeah

1077
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:57,419
# Whoa, oh, oh

1078
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:59,187
# Love, love

1079
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,388
# Love

1080
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:03,758
# From now on, from now on

1081
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:05,327
# From now on

1082
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:08,263
(Latrice)
That is what a lip-synch
for your life is, baby.

1083
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:11,666
That is high drag
at its finest.

1084
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:13,068
# From now on

1085
00:40:13,068 --> 00:40:15,937
[cheers and applause]

1086
00:40:19,107 --> 00:40:21,843
Wow.
That was amazing.

1087
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:23,411
I've made my decision.

1088
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:29,651
Dida Ritz...

1089
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,953
shante, you stay.

1090
00:40:31,953 --> 00:40:33,355
Thank you.

1091
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:35,991
That's the queen I want to see
from now on.

1092
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:37,559
From now on, queen.

1093
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,928
From now on.

1094
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:42,297
I promise.

1095
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:45,200
- You may join the other girls.
- Thank you.

1096
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,202
(RuPaul)
The Princess.

1097
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:50,238
Even though your time here
has been brief,

1098
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:53,408
you will be forever
<i>Drag Race</i> royalty.

1099
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:56,044
Long live The Princess.

1100
00:40:56,044 --> 00:40:57,045
Thank you.

1101
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:59,381
Now sashay away.

1102
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:04,219
[applause]

1103
00:41:07,222 --> 00:41:09,491
I'm not the type
to get upset or angry,

1104
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:11,326
but I don't think it was right
to send me home.

1105
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:15,197
This competition will definitely
be missing something

1106
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:19,801
not getting to see the rest
of what I had to offer.

1107
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:23,772
My top ten, condragulations.

1108
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,642
And the hits
just keep on coming.

1109
00:41:27,642 --> 00:41:29,511
Now, if you can't love yourself,

1110
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:31,947
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1111
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,148
Can I get a amen up in here?

1112
00:41:33,148 --> 00:41:34,583
(all)
Amen!

1113
00:41:34,583 --> 00:41:35,951
All right, now,
let the music play.

1114
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,086
Byeee!

1115
00:41:38,086 --> 00:41:40,655
# This is the beginning
of the record you like #

1116
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:44,092
#

1117
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:45,694
# Get it, get it

1118
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:47,896
# Get get get it,
get it right #

1119
00:41:47,896 --> 00:41:49,998
# This is the beginning

1120
00:41:49,998 --> 00:41:51,499
# The beginning

1121
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:56,571
# This is the beginning
of the rest of your life #
