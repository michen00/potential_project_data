1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,736
Let's get sickening.

2
00:00:02,737 --> 00:00:04,271
You'll need to survive

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:07,474
the biggest drag disaster
of all time.

4
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,076
[gasps]
The lighting from season one?

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,078
- The Rupocalypse.
- Oh, that sounds scary, too.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,348
Yeah.
oh, that's scary.

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,683
[screams]

8
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,218
Ooh, [bleep],
it's falling apart.

9
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:20,954
(Milan)
Jiggly's costume
is a hot mess.

10
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,656
(Rupaul)
Jiggly Caliente...

11
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,791
Lashauwn Beyond...

12
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,828
The Princess, Sharon Needles.

13
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:29,997
- This is my kind of ghoul.
- Bloody fabulous

14
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:32,432
Con-drag-ulations, You are
the winner of this challenge.

15
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:33,800
Thank you.

16
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,537
I'm just in disbelief
that I'm here.

17
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:37,771
Bitch, you're here.

18
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:38,906
Yeah, honey,
you better snap out of it.

19
00:00:38,907 --> 00:00:40,874
- Play to win.
- Snap out of it!

20
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,111
Jiggly Caliente,
shantay, you stay.

21
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:45,412
Thank you.

22
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:48,849
Alisa Summers, sashay away.

23
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,554
(Rupaul)
And tonight...
you'll be transforming

24
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:57,291
yourselves into wrestling's
trashiest fighters.

25
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,026
Be a lady.

26
00:00:59,027 --> 00:01:00,627
(Rupaul)
The dolls throw down...

27
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,129
Get out.
Y'all fake-ass hoes.

28
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,163
Get out of here.

29
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,731
[audience oohing]

30
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,099
(Rupaul)
And take flight.

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,135
Chicago, bitch.

32
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,637
[screaming]

33
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,739
(Rupaul)
With extra-special
guest judges

34
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,076
NBA stars Rick Fox
and John Salley.

35
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:18,445
Child, we got some
fine mens up in here tonight.

36
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:22,516
(Rupaul)
Will receive a lifetime supply
of NYX cosmetics,

40
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:37,397

# <i>RuPaul Drag Race</i> #

42
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:42,135
It's <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>
season four Ru-Veal.

43
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,138
Who knew that drag queens
wrestling would be

44
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,107
so much fun?

45
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,142
I did.
[laughs]

51
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:02,656
- A gorgeous day.
- Good morning, cluckers.

52
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,324
(Dida)
We walk in the
work room this morning,

53
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,326
and we see Alisa's message,
and it's kind of sad.

54
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,594
I mean, it was official.

55
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,663
Week by week, we're all
going to be going home.

56
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,432
- Officially.
(Kenya) "Keep it cute, ladies!

57
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:15,269
"Shady sisters 4-ever!

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,137
Love, Alisa."

59
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:19,173
- Look what you've done.
- That's what you've done, baby.

60
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,542
It was either her or me,
and I was not going home.

61
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:24,411
Let's take a vote.
Can we switch Jiggly for Alisa?

62
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,512
Whoo!

63
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:29,216
Girl, shady queens.
Shady queens!

64
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,652
(Jiggly)
Being in the bottom two
shook me.

65
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:34,421
I feel like there's a target
on the back of my head.

66
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,324
And all these bitches are trying
to assassinate me.

67
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,994
They're calling you the silent
killer, bitch, because

68
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,597
everybody thought you
were gonna win the challenge.

69
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:44,831
I mean, I did think
I was gonna win,

70
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,400
but I understand why
I didn't win.

71
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,268
- Well, after she had said--
- I'm too quiet.

72
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,870
Yeah, you're too quiet.

73
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:52,372
(Lashauwn)
I was quiet because
I was trying to focus.

74
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:55,409
My strategy isn't gonna change,
because I know that I prepared

75
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,311
a package to beat these girls.

76
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,712
So, I mean, I'm fine.

77
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,881
- Speak up, Lashauwn.
- Can everybody hear me?

78
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,950
Fly away.

79
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,618
- [siren wails]
(RuPaul) Ooh, girl.

80
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,520
She done already done
had herses.

81
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,622
- [cheers]
- Here we go!

82
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:09,656
Hello, dolls.

83
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,824
all: Hi.

84
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,260
I've come to pump you up

85
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:16,330
and I don't mean your lips.

86
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,332
So get ready to beat your mug,

87
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:21,435
pummel the runway, and fight
for the spotlight.

88
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:24,404
It's time for some
necessary roughness,

89
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:28,709
but, remember,
just anything but the face.

90
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,346
I'll get the money, mister.
Just don't hurt my face, please.

91
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:35,782
[applause]

92
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,085
- Hello, hello, hello.
- RuPaul!

93
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:41,722
- Hi.
- [cheers and applause]

94
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:44,324
Now, ladies, as you know,

95
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,227
padding is the foundation
of drag.

96
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:50,097
A queen's girlish figure
depends on it.

97
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:52,533
For today's
mini challenge,

98
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:55,869
I want you to make an ass
of yourself.

99
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,106
Literally.
Oh, pit crew.

100
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:02,176
You better ass somebody.

101
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:05,579
You have 30 minutes to put
all this junk

102
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,614
in your trunk.

103
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:10,517
I'm dividing you
into three groups.

104
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:13,153
And the one queen
from each group

105
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:16,356
with the juiciest ass
will win.

106
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:19,193
Ready, set, style.

107
00:04:19,194 --> 00:04:20,327
[exclamations and shouting]

108
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,095
Give me those foams!

109
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,499
Don't kick over
my packing peanuts.

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,568
(Chad)
I make fierce pads,
but this ain't how I usually

111
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:29,303
make my pads, y'all.

112
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,838
(Dida)
30 minutes is not enough.

113
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,941
You need at least a good hour
to even start making pads.

114
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:37,377
When making your ass,
always draw the shape of Africa.

115
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,579
That's it.

116
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,414
Or, as Latrice would say,
the homeland.

117
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,616
[Latrice giggles]
I'm Polynesian, bitch.

118
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,951
Get it straight, honey.

119
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:45,319
I thought we were doing an
athletic challenge,

120
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,255
so I'm in a jock.
Sorry about it.

121
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,362
Okay, lady-kins,
time's up.

122
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,465
All right.
Apple bottoms.

123
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:02,102
Now Jiggly is serving cellulite
realness.

124
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:05,405
- [laughter]
- Yeah, that's how realness is.

125
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,674
Now walk that ass.

126
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,111
Bottoms up.

127
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,880
Shake it, don't break it.

128
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:17,518
Phi Phi O'Hara, now that's what
I call a power bottom.

129
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,520
Seems like your pants
are coming down, Madame.

130
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:22,623
[screams, laughs]

131
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,758
Madame.

132
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,427
Next up,
the ghetto booties.

133
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:31,064
Make it pop. Now walk.

134
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:34,268
Hips don't lie,
but that ass do.

135
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,470
Girl, can I get some fries
with that shake?

136
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,205
- [laughter]
- Damn.

137
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:40,674
I had a proper ghetto booty,

138
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,211
and I was the only one
wearing lipstick.

139
00:05:44,212 --> 00:05:47,080
Next up, the badonkadonks.

140
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,416
A badonkadonk booty,
it's like a whole bunch of

141
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:52,252
donkadonkadonkadonkadadadada...

142
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,488
Yeah, what she said.

143
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:59,660
Ass everywhere, ass everywhere.
Ass everywhere.

144
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:02,496
Ooh, two scoops.

145
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:06,366
Ladies, all y'all
is sassy assassins.

146
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,769
But three of you really
killed it.

147
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,039
The winners of this mini
challenge are...

148
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,609
Okay, who's ass
is the hit of the class?

149
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,145
- Miss Phi Phi O'Hara...
- Whoo.

150
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:20,647
- Miss Willam...
- [applause]

151
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:24,284
- Miss Chad Michaels.
- Hey.

152
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,519
Con-drag-ulations.

153
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,256
If I were you,
I'd hold on tight

154
00:06:29,257 --> 00:06:31,358
to my padded ass,

155
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,894
because for this week's
main challenge,

156
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,330
you'll be transforming
yourselves

157
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,967
into wrestling's trashiest
fighters--

158
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:44,104
the luscious ladies
of the WTF.

159
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:46,340
- Yes!
- Whoo-hoo.

160
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:50,844
I am a big bitch.
Who is gonna outwrestle me?

161
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:51,879
Nobody.

162
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,614
You know, she may
have a point.

163
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:57,718
Oh, my God.
I am not athletic at all.

164
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:01,255
(RuPaul)
This week, you'll need to
flex your charisma, uniqueness,

165
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:04,191
nerve, and talent to become
over-the-top

166
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:06,159
wrestling characters.

167
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,530
You will compete in teams.

168
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,500
Phi Phi O'Hara, Willam,
Chad Michaels,

169
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:15,669
since you won
the mini challenge,

170
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,138
you are team captains.

171
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,607
You get to pick your queens,

172
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,042
starting with Phi Phi.

173
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,744
I'd have to go with Latrice.

174
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,281
Yes.

175
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,916
Dida.

176
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,218
- I will take Milan.
- Yeah.

177
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:33,053
- Come on down, baby.
- Kenya.

178
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,722
[growls]

179
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,391
Princess.

180
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,660
- Miss Needles.
- I am a knockout.

181
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:42,329
- [laughter]
- Uh, ow.

182
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,165
(Phi Phi)
I didn't want Jiggly
or Madame LaQueer because

183
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,534
they're always complaining
that their feet hurt

184
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:48,869
or they don't want to do
active stuff.

185
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,137
Lashauwn.

186
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,407
- [growls]
- There we go.

187
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,442
All right, Willam,
it's between Jiggly

188
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,244
and Madame LaQueer.

189
00:07:57,245 --> 00:07:59,213
I'm just praying, "Please pick
me, pick me, pick me,

190
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:00,514
pick me, pick me."

191
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,850
Jiggly.
[grunts]

192
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,818
Yes!
Wah!

193
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,653
[laughter and applause]

194
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,924
All right, so that means
that Chad gets Madame LaQueer.

195
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:14,328
It feels kind of weird
being, like, the last picked.

196
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:18,298
You know, the weird boy,
but I'm used to it, though.

197
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:22,202
Each team needs to decide
which two will play

198
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:26,373
the heroines, or the faces,
and which two will play

199
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:28,942
the villains, or the heels.

200
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:32,880
In a moment, you'll meet
three pros who will coach you

201
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:35,349
in the art of wrestling.

202
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,619
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

203
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,089
And may the best woman win!

204
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,525
Mama, you got
a dream team here.

205
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,193
I know.
That's why I picked it.

206
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,061
There's something
very important.

207
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,497
I had a previous injury
in my right ankle.

208
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,070
I hurt my right ankle
doing a show.

209
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:01,208
I didn't saw the step,
and my ankle goes click,

210
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:02,809
and suddenly
I couldn't walk.

211
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,511
So, are you gonna be okay?

212
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:07,014
- I mean, like, with your ankle?
- Don't worry about my ankle.

213
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,249
(Chad)
I am gonna worry about it,
because it's important.

214
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,552
If your ankle's hurting
and you can't do something,

215
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:14,288
you need to let me know--
- Safety first, people.

216
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:17,057
- Safety first.
(RuPaul) Coming up...

217
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,627
Put me down!

218
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,529
Jeeze--aah!
Wait!

219
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,298
Ugh.
Ouch!

220
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:25,933
[RuPaul laughs]

221
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:31,505
This maybe the best
episode ever!

222
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,640
- I'm so happy with this team.
- I know. I'm excited.

223
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,609
(Willam)
This challenge includes
a lot of steps.

224
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,079
We have to come up with
a back story, looks, costumes,

225
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,581
moves, everything.

226
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:43,717
I'm really good with falls
and, like, being, like, stunted.

227
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,152
I do stairs.
I can do anything.

228
00:09:45,153 --> 00:09:47,421
Willam is in charge.

229
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:48,789
(Willam)
I usually play people
who get beat up,

230
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,724
and I got my ass kicked on
every major network.

231
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:53,293
And we
just make sure that we--

232
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:55,195
attitude, attitude, attitude.

233
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:58,699
Wrestling isn't my thing.
I'm not a violent person.

234
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,968
So I'm a little concerned.

235
00:10:00,969 --> 00:10:02,436
We are gonna ace this,
you guys.

236
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,971
We gon' kick their ass.

237
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:11,178
(Phi Phi)
So our challenge
is to become wrestlers.

238
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,280
We're the first team to go up
and practice.

239
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:17,050
I see three humungous dudes
just going at each other.

240
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:19,920
- Oh, my God.
- Oh-hoo-hoo, yeah.

241
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:22,122
Bring on the men!

242
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,857
I'm "Hollywood's Own"
Joey Ryan.

243
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:26,860
Yo soy Hector
"El Chido" Canales.

244
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:30,030
I'm Mr. K.O.S. "King
of Submission" Ryan Taylor.

245
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,232
And I'm the queen of all media:
Oprah Winfrey

246
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,968
A little bit of the
choreography.

247
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,236
Go ahead and throw her
onto Ryan.

248
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,404
Oh.

249
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:40,140
You're gonna catch her
and fall.

250
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:42,209
This bitch heavy.

251
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,577
And then you fall
on your back.

252
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:47,581
- Oh, my God.
- Fall, bitch.

253
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:50,150
Thank you for flying
Air Kenya.

254
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:52,252
Put the mask on your face
before you put it

255
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,921
on your child's face.

256
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:55,622
(Phi Phi)
Lashauwn's not gonna
actually get the concept

257
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,291
of what she has to do here.

258
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,393
Come on, girl.
Come on.

259
00:10:59,394 --> 00:11:00,961
- [speaks Spanish]
- [whimpers]

260
00:11:00,962 --> 00:11:02,696
[growls]

261
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,698
(Lashauwn)
Everyone in my group's
personality is so loud...

262
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,233
[yells]

263
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:07,801
And I'm not really like that.

264
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:11,538
I'm really quiet
and, you know, soft.

265
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:13,340
Oh.

266
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:14,908
[laughter]

267
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:17,678
(Madame)
Let's go, Latrice.

268
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,614
(Joey)
So the bad guys make
their entrance.

269
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,816
They cannot care less
about the audience, right?

270
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,451
- Make us hate you.
- Be yourself.

271
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:27,621
I got this.
This is cake.

272
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:29,256
[bleep] y'all.
I don't give a [bleep].

273
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,793
New York, mother[bleep].
Brooklyn!

274
00:11:32,794 --> 00:11:34,394
Jiggly was very aggressive.

275
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:36,330
[bleep] y'all.
I've got this [bleep].

276
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:38,298
And I was like, girl,
take it down a notch.

277
00:11:38,299 --> 00:11:40,133
New York, baby.

278
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:41,301
I'm not from New York.

279
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:43,136
Oh, well...

280
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,105
And you were good, too.

281
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:47,608
(Willam)
Princess is giving
closed-captioning,

282
00:11:47,609 --> 00:11:48,976
while she's in stereo.

283
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,212
(Joey)
We're gonna demonstrate some
holds for you.

284
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:54,781
We were thinking of
a body slam.

285
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,121
Do any of you guys
have a problem with that?

286
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,490
I'm concerned that something
could happen with my ankle.

287
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,859
and making our team lose.

288
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,262
I have a lot
to be nervous about.

289
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:10,297
All right,
come on, Madame.

290
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,799
My damn face is sick
of looking at you.

291
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,234
[grunting]

292
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,636
Oh. Oh!

293
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:18,805
- Get her up.
- [screams]

294
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,474
- Put me down.
- Take your time. Slow.

295
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:23,076
Jeez Louise.

296
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:25,479
- Ugh.
- Sorry.

297
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,748
- Ouch.
- You okay?

298
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,050
I'm nervous
about Madame LaQueer.

299
00:12:30,051 --> 00:12:32,786
She's not as physical
as the rest of us.

300
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:36,757
She really has to push, push,
and push through it.

301
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,926
Push it real good.

302
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,430
- Hello, hello, hello.
all: Hi.

303
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,500
Well,
team Phi Phi O'Hara...

304
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:47,634
Yes.

305
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,103
Which team is the faces?

306
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:51,939
It would be me and Lashauwn.

307
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,807
So, of course, these two
are the heels.

308
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,142
What is your story?

309
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:57,377
They gave us the wrong
treatment,

310
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:59,112
- and we grew beards instead...
- I see.

311
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,681
And we're a little bitter
about that.

312
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,482
Are you actually gonna
be wearing beards?

313
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,550
Yes.

314
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,118
You know,
that concerns me a little bit,

315
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:09,790
because the luscious ladies
of the WTF need to be beautiful.

316
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,993
I think our story will get
across, and it's not that they--

317
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,362
But you're not the one who's
gonna be looking hideous,

318
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,598
are you, darling?

319
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,833
People watch wrestling because
they want to be excited,

320
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:22,803
they want to be turned on.
They want beauty.

321
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:24,304
Now, Lashauwn, can you give me
a little taste

322
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,174
of what your good guy says?

323
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:28,809
"Oh, I'm gonna kick your ass."

324
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,446
In wrestling,
the good guys are just

325
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:35,449
as loud and obnoxious
as the bad guys.

326
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,618
Is it fair to say that you're
still working on it,

327
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:39,019
you haven't, sort of...
- We are still working on it.

328
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,021
- Figured it out yet?
- I mean, yeah, we are.

329
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:42,656
I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

330
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:43,957
- All right.
- Bye, Ru.

331
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,294
Team Willam,
what's going on?

332
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,963
Who on your team
are the faces?

333
00:13:49,964 --> 00:13:52,432
[laughs]

334
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,301
Now what are your costumes
gonna be like?

335
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,937
Was that something that you made
or you already had?

336
00:13:56,938 --> 00:13:58,238
(Princess)
We just embellished
on top of it.

337
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,506
(RuPaul)
Oh, I see.

338
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:00,974
And I'm embellishing on top
of mine as well.

339
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,777
Jiggly, you took some heat
last week for your costume.

340
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:04,912
Yeah.

341
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:06,313
(RuPaul)
You know, we are looking for

342
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:09,116
the luscious ladies
of the WTF.

343
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:10,784
Oh, I'll be luscious.

344
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:13,787
I'm not trying to be in that
bottom two again.

345
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:16,089
(RuPaul)
Gather around, dolls.

346
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,427
Now, tomorrow at the WTF
main event,

347
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:24,164
we'll be joined by our
extra-special guest judges...

348
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:29,236
NBA champions Rick Fox
and John Salley.

349
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,171
Ballars.

350
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:35,943
I think I'll tuck extra-tight
for Rick Fox and John Salley.

351
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,145
Now, remember, safety first,

352
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:41,748
but, whatever you do,
don't [bleep] it up.

353
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:44,051
all: Bye, Ru.

354
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,219
Whoo.

(RuPaul)
Coming up...

356
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:49,022
Bring on the glamazons!

357

[crowd oohs]

358
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,330
You can't take it.

359
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,702
[laughs]

360
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:05,608
This is one of my favorite
<i>Drag Race</i> challenges ever!

361
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,544
[cheering]

362
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:13,182
Ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:16,486
are you ready to experience

364
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:22,258
- a female phenomenon?
- [cheering]

365
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:25,895
Bring on the glamazons!

366
00:15:27,196 --> 00:15:30,967
This show is crazy, girl.

367
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:33,836
Oh, my God, can you believe
those Bitter Betties

368
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,371
came in here
to ask us for help?

369
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:36,806
And I even let them
use, like,

370
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:38,808
my really good
hair products.

371
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:41,277
- That product?
- Yeah.

372
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,680
That's the hair-growing
tonic.

373
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:45,682
- [laughs]
- Stop!

374
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:50,053
[speaks native language]

375
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,689
You--look what you did
to her hair.

376
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,591
Are you upset because you can't
handle all this fishiness?

377
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,760
Your plastic hair
and your plastic tits

378
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,762
and your plastic ass.

379
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:02,198
We'll handle you.
We'll get in the ring.

380
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,334
- Bring it. Bring it on.
- Come on, girls. Come on.

381
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:07,303
[cheers]

382
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:09,639
(RuPaul)
Mess with these nasty girls

383
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,575
and you'll end up with a bad
taste in your mouth.

384
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:15,578
Give it up for
Latrice "The Beast"

385
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,314
and "Killer" Kenya,

386
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,317

and Phi Phi "Fierce."

392
00:16:33,597 --> 00:16:35,331
(Phi Phi)
The crowd was chanting

393
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:37,300
and all the signs that
had our names everywhere.

394
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:38,634
It felt so good.

395
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,470
I was ready to beat those
bitches down.

396
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:42,472
- [bell clinks]
- You tell 'em, girl.

397
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:44,140
You're so pretty.

398
00:16:45,675 --> 00:16:46,809
- Ooh.
- Whoa!

399
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,845

Get up!

402

[speaks Spanish]

403
00:17:04,561 --> 00:17:07,764
Um, honey, I
don't speak Spanish.

404
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,900
[booing]

405
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,602
I want to teach you
Spanish right now.

406
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:13,603
<i>Puta!</i>

[screaming]

409
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,177
Oh, hell, no.

[shouts]

411
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:29,018
Now I'm gonna show you

412
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:31,154
how to really
beat a mug, bitch.

413
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:38,361

423
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:04,220
(RuPaul)
Bitter, bitter pill
to swallow.

424
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:05,922
The Bitter Betties win.

425
00:18:05,923 --> 00:18:08,825
[booing]

426
00:18:08,826 --> 00:18:10,927
Those other teams
better watch out

427
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,562
because me and my girls,
we kicked ass.

428

[booing]

429
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:18,267
Touch this skin, honey.
They can't take it.

Mm-mm.
They're overgrown...

431
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,871
both: Orangutans.

432
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:24,707
Speaking of orangutans.

433
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,776
What are you doing in our
dressing room?

434
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:29,879
We know it's your dressing room,
as tacky as it is,

435
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,314
like y'all two bitches.

436
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,583
Oh, no,
she better don't.

437
00:18:33,584 --> 00:18:34,851
We don't want to go there.

438
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,719
We saw you two
in Coach Carter's office.

439
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,121
Oh, so that's how we got kicked
out of school?

440
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:39,322
'Cause of y'all bitches?

441
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:40,690

Now this is why we watch
<i>Drag Race.</i>

The Princess, she's not going
as crazy as I am.

470
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,985
So if I get in the bottom two
because of this bitch,

471
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,153
it ain't gonna be cute.

472

- What?
- That's not fair.

474

They're tag-teaming her.
That's not fair!

That's not fair!

476
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,134
Television don't get
no better than this.

00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:00,436
I'm just saying.

478
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:02,338

Oh, Milan "LaModel",

487
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,228
I have to be honest with you.

488
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:27,096
I woke up with
an itch down there,

489
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,999
an itch in my pubic hair.

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,869
I've got snatch-scratch
fever, too.

491
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,571
The struggle is real.

492
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,207
Look who it is.
It's the Bitch Kickers.

493
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,576
What's up there,
Knockouts?

494
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:44,013
How's it hanging,
scratch 'n' sniff?

[speaks nonsense]

496
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:48,151
They must have gotten our
special delivery we sent in

497
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:50,286
when we banged
their boyfriends.

498

Hate them because
they're bitches.

511

You want some of this?

512
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:27,457

You skinny little
blonde bimbo.

518
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,170
You can run,
but you can't hide.

519
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:44,574
All right, well, I'm fast
as a butterfly--

I am a little bit worried about
Madame LaQueer's ankle.

524
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:56,986
I mean, you're the captain
of the ship,

525
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:58,388
you're going down
with the ship.

526
00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:01,724
All right, Kirstie Alley
before <i>Dancing with the Stars.</i>

527
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:04,827
[exclamations]

528
00:22:04,828 --> 00:22:06,095
[shouts indistinctly]

529
00:22:06,096 --> 00:22:08,731
This is not in my contract!

530
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:11,901
If my ankle hurted,
I forgot about everything.

531
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:14,103
I was Madame "LaCrush"
in that moment.

532
00:22:17,173 --> 00:22:20,009
[cheers and applause]

533
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,444
(RuPaul)
Coming up...

534
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,781
We didn't see any of the rebel
that I know you are.

535
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:26,549
It's not memorable enough
for me.

536
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,019
- It was fake.
- Fake? My girl? Never!

537
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,370
[laughs]

538
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:35,572
Stop staring at your phone
and pay attention!

539
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:37,374
Yay.

540
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:38,909
Miss Cheesecake.

541
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,345
It's elimination day,
and everyone's really anxious

542
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:44,181
right now to find out
how they did

543
00:22:44,182 --> 00:22:45,715
in the wrestling challenge.

544
00:22:45,716 --> 00:22:47,784
(Dida)
I think we have a really good
shot at winning.

545
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:48,952
I hope.

546
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:50,453
I'm just worried.

547
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,155
(Willam)
What are you worried about?
You did great.

548
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:53,323
You were so funny.

549
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,091
Were you unpleased
with anything

550
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:56,359
when you left the ring
yesterday?

551
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,428
With me, no.

552
00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:01,131
(Jiggly)
I am kind of iffy
about Princess.

553
00:23:01,132 --> 00:23:04,801
It is a competition
and they don't like one thing,

554
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:08,271
the whole team goes down--
it's a team challenge.

555
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:11,541
(Princess)
That energy you're giving off
is bringing everybody else down.

556
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:13,877
Girl, I cannot
be bothered right now.

557
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:17,814
Queen Winnona cannot be
bothered dot com, darling.

558
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,282
I am a little bit nervous.

559
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,318
You might feel some sort
of kind of way,

560
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,452
and then you could
be dead wrong.

561
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:23,820
Mm-hmm.

562
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:25,655
Thinking you a sickening bitch
and talented bitch,

563
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:27,324
and they be like,
"wah-wah-wah."

564
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:28,525
I'm a little nervous to see

565
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:31,228
what the judges think about
me in the ring.

566
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,997
I did my best,
but you never know

567
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:35,131
what they're gonna say.

568
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,467
You sew for all the girls
back at home?

569
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:40,737
Like, the girls.
The girls the girls.

570
00:23:40,738 --> 00:23:43,540
Just girls like you.
By me sewing so much,

571
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,643
I don't really get a chance
to even be in drag myself.

572
00:23:46,644 --> 00:23:48,845
- Uh-huh.
- So it's like I missed

573
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:51,681
- my drag childhood.
- Ha ha.

574
00:23:51,682 --> 00:23:54,217
So that's why the competition
is perfect for me,

575
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:57,387
'cause I'm just filling in
for what I missed out on.

576
00:23:57,388 --> 00:23:58,889
That's sickening,
'cause you definitely

577
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,257
about to make up
for some lost time.

578
00:24:00,258 --> 00:24:02,559
- Ooh.
- Hey, that's what you get.

579
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,428
The ultimate drag
boot camp of life.

580
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:09,599
Madame, what does your family
think about you doing drag?

581
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,002
I'm not close
to my family at all.

582
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:13,970
My family, for me,
are my friends.

583
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,173
They're the best friends
in the whole world.

584
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:17,707
Baby, don't. It's okay, <i>mami.</i>

585
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,311
We're selfish and vain
creatures of beauty,

586
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:22,712
and isn't it bizarre
how we make

587
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:24,614
the best friends
in the world?

588
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:26,850
Everybody say "love."

589
00:24:32,756 --> 00:24:34,825
[RuPaul laughs]

590
00:24:35,926 --> 00:24:37,694
Bam!

591
00:24:37,695 --> 00:24:38,995
#Covergirl #

592
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,431
# Put the bass in your walk

593
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:42,766
# Head to toe

594
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:45,135
# Let your whole body talk

595
00:24:45,136 --> 00:24:48,104
# And what?

596
00:24:48,105 --> 00:24:50,774
(RuPaul) Hey, guys.
- Hey, baby.

597
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:54,377
Welcome to the main stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race.</i>

598
00:24:54,378 --> 00:24:57,581
Michelle Visage,
my tag-team sister.

599
00:24:57,582 --> 00:25:00,116
I got a Full Nelson for you
right here, Mama.

600
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:03,487
[chuckles]
Billy B, welcome home.

601
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,621
Thanks, Ru.

602
00:25:04,622 --> 00:25:06,156
Are you wrestling
with something?

603
00:25:06,157 --> 00:25:07,924
Not since I was trying to
get my wallet back

604
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,392
from Michelle in the back.

605
00:25:09,393 --> 00:25:10,794
[chuckles]

606
00:25:10,795 --> 00:25:13,296
Hey, Rick Fox, what did you
think of my girls?

607
00:25:13,297 --> 00:25:15,432
I was impressed.
Think there was a lot of fight.

608
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:18,568
Good. And John Salley.

609
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:21,138
Hello, Ru.
BK in the house.

610
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:23,406
[laughter]
I'm so glad you're here.

611
00:25:23,407 --> 00:25:26,576
This week, our queens were
challenged to hit the mats

612
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:30,247
as the luscious ladies
of the WTF.

613
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:32,916
Tonight,
I've asked them all to come

614
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:36,353
decked out in their best
girly-girl attire.

615
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:38,522
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

616
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:41,091
and may the best woman win!

617
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:44,828
# Welcome to jungle

618
00:25:44,829 --> 00:25:48,365
First up, Kenya Michaels.
Gorgeous.

619
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:51,201
You know,
Lil' Kim only wishes.

620
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:52,702
(Michelle)
It's a pink Monday.

621
00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:54,104
(Kenya)
I love the runway.

622
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:57,107
I feel amazing
because I love to walk.

623
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:58,742
(Billy)
Now that is a living doll.

624
00:25:58,743 --> 00:26:01,912
(RuPaul)
Mary-Kate Minaj.

625
00:26:01,913 --> 00:26:04,014
Lashauwn Beyond.

626
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:06,783
She melts in your mouth,
not in your hand.

627
00:26:06,784 --> 00:26:08,819
(Michelle)
Got a penny?
She's got a ball.

628
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,220
[RuPaul laughs]

629
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:11,955
(Lashauwn)
I'm serving bubble
gum yum-yum,

630
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:15,692
just having fun being flirty,
pretty, going girly beyond.

631
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:18,895
Come through!

632
00:26:18,896 --> 00:26:21,031
(Michelle)
Where is her slot anyway?

633
00:26:21,032 --> 00:26:23,433
(RuPaul) Sharon Needles.
(Michelle) Ooh.

634
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:25,469
The lost Arquette sister.

635
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,637
(RuPaul)
Oh, wow, she's doing femme.

636
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:29,940
She got an injection of beauty.

637
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:34,110
(Sharon)
Playing girly-ish, bouncy,
and sexy is just something

638
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,645
really foreign to me.

639
00:26:35,646 --> 00:26:38,215
Just want to show the judges
that I could bring beauty

640
00:26:38,216 --> 00:26:40,350
to the stage
in this competition.

641
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:41,351
(RuPaul) Mwah.

642
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:43,186
For your consideration,

643
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,355
Jiggly Caliente.

644
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:47,491
(Billy)
Kimora Lee Simmons
has put on some weight.

645
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:49,359
(RuPaul)
Jiggle it, girl.

646
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,963
(Jiggly)
I'm serving banjee girl
meets sweet 16.

647
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:54,231
Very new York.

648
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:56,666
(RuPaul)
It's Jiggly 's quinceañera.

649
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:59,469
London, Paris, Milan.

650
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,005
I see London, I see France,

651
00:27:02,006 --> 00:27:04,708
I see Milan 's underpants.

652
00:27:04,709 --> 00:27:08,245
(Milan)
I am feeling like black Barbie
meets a valley girl.

653
00:27:08,246 --> 00:27:10,514
But, because John Salley
is there,

654
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:12,282
- I'd rather be a Salley girl.
- [giggles]

655
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:15,285
(Michelle)
Once she gets pumping,
it's hard to make the body stop.

656
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:19,990
(RuPaul)
Madame LaQueer.
Represent Puerto Rico.

657
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:21,158
[Michelle speaks Spanish]

658
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:23,593
She's working
the asymmetrical hairdo.

659
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:25,495
(Billy)
Or a hair show in Mississippi.

660
00:27:25,496 --> 00:27:27,998
(Madame)
I feel great.
I feel like I'm floating.

661
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:30,500
I think is the most beautiful
I've looked

662
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:32,536
throughout
all the competitions.

663
00:27:32,537 --> 00:27:36,239
(RuPaul)
Where there's smoke,
there's a pussy on fire.

664
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,341
- [laughter]
- This is why I love this show.

665
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:41,711
(RuPaul)
Dida Ritz.

666
00:27:41,712 --> 00:27:43,180
(Michelle)
I thought it was
P. Diddy's mom.

667
00:27:43,181 --> 00:27:45,148
- [Rick laughs]
(RuPaul) Janice Combs.

668
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,783
(Dida)
I'm giving fish,
I'm giving face,

669
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:48,251
I'm giving you vogue.

670
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,020
I know my runway is fierce.

671
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:51,721
(RuPaul)
Look at those legs. My good--

672
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:53,023
and they go
all the way up.

673
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:54,658
(Michelle)
They do? Are you sure?

674
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,893
- Yeah.
- They're not wooden?

675
00:27:56,894 --> 00:28:01,164
(RuPaul)
Chad Michaels.
Lady Chatterley.

676
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,767
Oh, my goodness,
the world according to Paris.

677
00:28:03,768 --> 00:28:06,102
(Billy)
Paris Hilton,
where are they now?

678
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:09,372
(Chad)
I'm serving up girly-girl
realness fish on a stick.

679
00:28:09,373 --> 00:28:11,942
I kind of look just like
a yummy little cupcake.

680
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:13,677
Mmm. I'm hungry.

681
00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:16,746
(RuPaul)
She wants her old body back.

682
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:18,715
The Princess.

683
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:20,016
She had a little time
for a quick blowout

684
00:28:20,017 --> 00:28:21,685
before she came out.

685
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:22,652
(Michelle)
It's a windstorm backstage,
I'm thinking.

686
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:23,854
(RuPaul)
Yes, yes.

687
00:28:23,855 --> 00:28:25,589
(Princess)
The look I'm going for is

688
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:28,425
very rock star
meets little girl.

689
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,694
I am so pumped
for my look today.

690
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:32,462
(Michelle)
Rock on.

691
00:28:32,463 --> 00:28:35,365
(RuPaul)
It's like there's something
about The Princess.

692
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:37,200
[Michelle laughs]

693
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,203
Up next, Phi Phi O'Hara.

694
00:28:40,204 --> 00:28:41,738
(Billy)
Telemundo.

695
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:44,007
(RuPaul)
Telenovela realness.

696
00:28:44,008 --> 00:28:46,076
(Phi Phi)
I was showing
a little bit of skin

697
00:28:46,077 --> 00:28:48,645
and giving them dragged-out
Miami housewife.

698
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:52,415
(RuPaul)
Ooh, her legs are like peanut
butter--easy to spread.

699
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,952
Latrice Royale.

700
00:28:55,953 --> 00:28:58,555
Ooh, Crown Royal.

701
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:00,690
I'll have one on the rocks.

702
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:04,694
(Latrice)
I am feeling good
and looking gorgeous, darling.

703
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:07,364
Pretty in pink.
I was very pleased.

704
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:10,133
(RuPaul)
Star Jones called,
she wants her old body back.

705
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:13,270
(Michelle)
She can't have it.
It's otherwise preoccupied.

706
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,905
(RuPaul)
Allegedly.

707
00:29:14,906 --> 00:29:16,373
[Rick laughter]

708
00:29:16,374 --> 00:29:17,874
(RuPaul)
Next up, Willam.

709
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:19,676
(Michelle) Hey.
(RuPaul) Wow.

710
00:29:19,677 --> 00:29:21,077
Look at those shoes.

711
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:24,181
(Willam)
My look for today
is rich bitch mistress.

712
00:29:24,182 --> 00:29:26,917
I'm serving girly-girl
on a platter

713
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:29,219
to go,
sauce on the side.

714
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,956
(RuPaul)
Look how her outfit
accentuates her sugar walk.

715
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:35,492
(Billy)
Toddlers and Tiaras,
where are they now?

716
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,661
(RuPaul)
I think she's Tanya Tucker.

717
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:41,198
Coming up...

718
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:43,667
In the ring,
you were freaking hil-ar-ious!

719
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:45,335
- Baby, baby!
- [laughs]

720
00:29:45,336 --> 00:29:47,037
I'm a fan from the hair
to the dress.

721
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:48,572
I disagree.
I hate your hair.

722
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:49,873
Oh, he went there.

723
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:53,536
[laughs]

724
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:55,370
[dramatic music]

725
00:29:55,371 --> 00:29:57,706
Let's get judgey.

726
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:00,609
Mm-kay?

727
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,345
Yesterday,
you changed the face

728
00:30:03,346 --> 00:30:06,215
of professional wrestling
forever.

729
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:08,784
I smell a spin-off.

730
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:11,053
But one group in particular

731
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:14,856
really smacked down
the competition.

732
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:18,427
The winning WTF team is...

733
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:23,632
Team Chad Michaels.

734
00:30:23,633 --> 00:30:25,934
- Whoo!
- Jesus.

735
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:27,803
[laughter]

736
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:29,137
Thank you, Ru.

737
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:32,241
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

738
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:36,211
But two divas
stole the show.

739
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:41,817
Madame LaQueer,
Chad Michaels.

740
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:44,286
- The Bitch Kickers.
(Michelle) Good job, ladies.

741
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:47,656
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

742
00:30:47,657 --> 00:30:51,827
You'll receive a selection
of wigs from Risque Wigs.

743
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,762
(Madame)
Oh, my God,
I feel so great.

744
00:30:53,763 --> 00:30:55,797
I certainly actually
proved them wrong

745
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:58,000
about having
picking me last.

746
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:03,338
However, neither of you will
receive immunity next week.

747
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,240
Sorry about it.

748
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:06,675
You may leave the stage.

749
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:15,450
Ladies, it's time
for the judges' critiques.

750
00:31:15,451 --> 00:31:17,452
First up, Willam.

751
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:18,954
- Hey, mama.
- Hi.

752
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,089
Did everything turn out
the way you had planned?

753
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,958
I think our moves kicked ass.

754
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,127
Oh, I thought the competition
was weak in the ring.

755
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:30,432
The faces she was giving us
just didn't seem believable.

756
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:31,800
It was fake.

757
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:33,635
Wait a minute,
wrestling is not fake.

758
00:31:33,636 --> 00:31:35,704
No, that wrestling was fake.

759
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:36,872
(RuPaul)
Thank you, Willam.

760
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:39,541
Next up, Dida Ritz.

761
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,443
Now why'd you choose this
as your girly look?

762
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:43,312
I'm really channeling
Carrie Bradshaw,

763
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:45,914
so I thought downtown
New York, very chic.

764
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:47,816
In the ring, you had,
you know,

765
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:50,886
the girl that sort of walked
around the ring thing perfect,

766
00:31:50,887 --> 00:31:53,822
better than you had
the wrestling down.

767
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:55,657
(RuPaul)
Thank you, Dida.

768
00:31:55,658 --> 00:31:57,259
The Princess.

769
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,962
I'm a fan from the hair
to the dress.

770
00:31:59,963 --> 00:32:01,597
I think I bought that dress
for my daughter.

771
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:03,765
I disagree.
I hate your hair.

772
00:32:03,766 --> 00:32:06,602
I think it looks
like a bad hair show.

773
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:09,304
As far as the performance goes,

774
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:11,907
we didn't see any of the rebel
that I know you are.

775
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,642
I'm a very Zen person.

776
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:16,011
Just know that
that was me really trying.

777
00:32:16,012 --> 00:32:17,980
Try harder.

778
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,115
All right,
let's go to Jiggly Caliente.

779
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:21,116
May I call you Jiggly?

780
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:22,851
Of course you can, Ru.

781
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,386
How'd you feel on the runway?

782
00:32:24,387 --> 00:32:25,787
I felt so cute.

783
00:32:25,788 --> 00:32:28,857
The lollipop in my mouth,
door knockers in my ears.

784
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:30,792
The lollipop was more
interesting for me

785
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:33,095
than what you're doing
style-wise.

786
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,997
And tell me about in the ring.

787
00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:37,366
It was very energetic
and over the top.

788
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,902
Jiggly, what was the hardest
part of this challenge?

789
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:42,638
The thing is, Princess is very
Zen, she's very quiet.

790
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,074
We needed to be,
like, crazy, badass bitches.

791
00:32:46,075 --> 00:32:48,043
(Michelle)
It's hard when
you're in a team,

792
00:32:48,044 --> 00:32:49,811
and you're trying to make up
for both of you.

793
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:53,782
Thank you, Jiggly.
Next up, Phi Phi O'Hara.

794
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:54,983
Hi.

795
00:32:54,984 --> 00:32:58,487
You were reading older
than you have to.

796
00:32:58,488 --> 00:33:02,624
You could be younger
and more modern.

797
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:06,261
I'm watching you, Phi Phi.
I love you.

798
00:33:06,262 --> 00:33:07,496
I think you're gorgeous,
and in the ring,

799
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:09,765
you were freakin'
hi-lar-i-ous.

800
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:11,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Phi Phi.

801
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:15,837
- Lashauwn Beyond.
- Hi, Ru.

802
00:33:15,838 --> 00:33:18,607
- How are your balls?
- My balls are great.

803
00:33:18,608 --> 00:33:21,476
On the runway,
the gumball machine told me

804
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,579
exactly what those balls
were doing on your chest.

805
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,080
(Michelle)
Better than on her chin.

806
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:26,548
Ha!

807
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:28,283
I couldn't disagree more.

808
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:29,685
Your hair and your makeup,

809
00:33:29,686 --> 00:33:31,420
you look like
a backup singer

810
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:33,555
for Luther Vandross in 1988.

811
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:37,492
Rick Fox, what'd you think?
The ring?

812
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:38,860
It's not memorable
enough for me.

813
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:41,029
[booing]

814
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,631
I would have liked
a little more story

815
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:45,667
and color to the character.

816
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:49,238
- Next up, Kenya Michaels.
- Hola.

817
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:52,341
I thought it was Nicki Minaj.
I'm not joking you.

818
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:55,244
Except she doesn't have the ass
of Nicki or the money.

819
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:58,013
What about as a wrestler?
As "Killer" Kenya?

820
00:33:58,014 --> 00:34:02,050
It was like it was Biggie Smalls
and Lil' Kim all over again.

821
00:34:02,051 --> 00:34:04,052
- Baby, baby.
- [laughs]

822
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:07,122
You look like a star,
you look modern,

823
00:34:07,123 --> 00:34:08,590
you look fashionable,

824
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:10,325
and I think
you're the one to beat.

825
00:34:10,326 --> 00:34:13,362
Ooh, she turned it out.

826
00:34:13,363 --> 00:34:15,264
- Latrice Royale.
- Hello, Ru.

827
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:17,165
Shag-quille O'Neal
Latrice.

828
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,034
[laughs]

829
00:34:19,035 --> 00:34:23,372
You set the tone
for the whole afternoon.

830
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,573
Oh!

831
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:27,609
- You had me at splat.
- [laughs]

832
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,945
(RuPaul)
Thank you, Latrice.

833
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,548
Well, ladies, I think
we've heard enough.

834
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:34,416
While you girls untuck

835
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,351
in the Interior Illusions
Lounge,

836
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:38,687
the judges and I will
deliberate.

837
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,789
You may leave the stage.

838
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,693
All right, just between us
brothers and brother-lovers...

839
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:47,896
- Thank you.
- Let's start with Willam.

840
00:34:47,897 --> 00:34:51,033
I think Willam is extremely
fierce and extremely talented

841
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:52,568
and very freakin' funny.

842
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:55,737
But I also think there's
a borderline of smarminess.

843
00:34:55,738 --> 00:34:56,838
I think there might
be an attitude in there

844
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,307
that can get in the way.

845
00:34:58,308 --> 00:35:01,143
She seemed like a team captain
that didn't lead.

846
00:35:01,144 --> 00:35:03,011
I think she did a good job
of leading.

847
00:35:03,012 --> 00:35:06,748
I don't feel that The Princess
did a good job of following.

848
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,183
All right, let's talk
about The Princess.

849
00:35:08,184 --> 00:35:10,652
Her performance
was really flat.

850
00:35:10,653 --> 00:35:12,988
I kind of thought
there was a rock star in there.

851
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:15,891
She's not charismatic enough
to be a rock star.

852
00:35:15,892 --> 00:35:17,960
(RuPaul) Dida Ritz.
- She's pretty.

853
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:20,929
It's just the wigs are not
styled, they're not done.

854
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:23,465
You know, she was going
for <i>Sex and the City,</i>

855
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,866
and it was more like
<i>Sex in the Alley.</i>

856
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:26,168
Oh, okay.

857
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,603
Well, I'm not gonna turn
that down either.

858
00:35:27,604 --> 00:35:28,637
- [laughs]
- [clucks like chicken]

859
00:35:28,638 --> 00:35:30,205
Jiggly Caliente.

860
00:35:30,206 --> 00:35:32,774
In the ring, she uses
everything she has.

861
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,309
I thought that was an outfit

862
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,044
until I realized that was
really her belly.

863
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:38,013
[laughs]

864
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:39,381
Phi Phi O'Hara.

865
00:35:39,382 --> 00:35:40,949
I don't know what's under
all that makeup,

866
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:43,018
but she doesn't
paint herself pretty.

867
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,821
I know she's heavy-handed
on the makeup, but hey...

868
00:35:45,822 --> 00:35:46,989
who isn't?

869
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,024
That's right, Mama.

870
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:51,393
Lashauwn Beyond.
Now, it was remarked that

871
00:35:51,394 --> 00:35:54,496
Lashauwn's personality
was kind of shy.

872
00:35:54,497 --> 00:35:56,398
She'll get out of that shyness
when she realizes

873
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,433
- it doesn't get her anywhere.
(Billy) She's a mess.

874
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:01,436
And her personality is like a...

875
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:03,739
Like a brick.

876
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,974
All right, Kenya Michaels.

877
00:36:05,975 --> 00:36:07,943
Little Puerto Rican sweetheart.

878
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:10,846
(Billy)
She's half the size
of any of them

879
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,815
with double or triple
everything else.

880
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:16,218
There was nothing wrong.

881
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:18,253
(Michelle)
Her performance
was flawless as well.

882
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:20,389
I thought she did a great job
as "Killer" Kenya.

883
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,924
(RuPaul)
Latrice Royale.

884
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:24,660
She owned that role
in the ring.

885
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:27,462
It was hard for anyone else
to do better than that.

886
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:30,198
I was very happy with her,
and I do really like her

887
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:33,302
and her personality,
so she's gonna be fun to watch.

888
00:36:33,303 --> 00:36:37,139
All right, silence.

889
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,943
Bring back my girls.

890
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:43,212
More will be Ru-Vealed
Don't go away.

891
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:46,469
[laughs]

892
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:49,405
The time has come.

893
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:51,541
(RuPaul)
Based on your presentation

894
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:55,278
in the main ring
and on the main stage,

895
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:57,714
I've made some decisions.

896
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,350
Latrice Royale,

897
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,485
Kenya Michaels,

898
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:04,921
Phi Phi O'Hara,

899
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:08,591
you ladies jumped
on this wrestling challenge

900
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:11,728
and came out on top.

901
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,430
- You are all safe.
- Thank you.

902
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:18,234
You may leave the stage.

903
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:21,104
Okay, see, now it's
gon' get tense.

904
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:25,742
Jiggly Caliente,
we want to know

905
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:30,113
is there more to you than just
a queen from the 'hood?

906
00:37:31,881 --> 00:37:35,518
You are safe.

907
00:37:35,518 --> 00:37:36,986
Thank you. Thank you.

908
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:38,688
You may join the other girls.

909
00:37:41,457 --> 00:37:43,126
The Princess.

910
00:37:43,126 --> 00:37:45,161
You were channeling P!nk,

911
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:47,697
but your performance
was beige.

912
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:50,233
Well, if that's how
you really feel.

913
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,835
I'm sorry, my dear, but you are
up for elimination.

914
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,739
I'm shocked.
My outfit was on it today,

915
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,675
whether Billy B
liked my hair or not.

916
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:00,844
And I worked my ass off
yesterday in the ring.

917
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:03,213
There's no reason why I should
have been in the bottom two.

918
00:38:06,649 --> 00:38:09,452
Willam...

919
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:11,087
you're safe.

920
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:12,956
- Bye.
- Oh--okay.

921
00:38:15,525 --> 00:38:18,127
Lashauwn Beyond,

922
00:38:18,127 --> 00:38:22,365
as a wrestler, you were more
mumble than rumble.

923
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,537
Dida Ritz, your <i>Sex and the City</i>
couture

924
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:30,507
does not deserve a sequel.

925
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:33,309
I mean, who comes up
with this stuff?

926
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,144
Dida Ritz...

927
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:37,580
You're safe.

928
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,681
Thank you.

929
00:38:44,053 --> 00:38:46,556
Lashauwn Beyond,
I'm sorry, my dear,

930
00:38:46,556 --> 00:38:48,358
but you are up
for elimination.

931
00:38:50,593 --> 00:38:52,729
My whole body
started pumping.

932
00:38:52,729 --> 00:38:54,931
I'm nervous because I want
to stay in the competition

933
00:38:54,931 --> 00:38:57,734
and I know this dictates
if I will or not.

934
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:00,837
Two queens stand before me.

935
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,172
Ladies,
this is your last chance

936
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:05,475
to impress me
and save yourself

937
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:08,244
from elimination.

938
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:11,748
The time has come
to lip-sync...

939
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:13,883
for your life.

940
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:19,455
I'm pretty amazing
and I'm ready to show it.

941
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,857
Bring it on.

942
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:24,561
Good luck
and don't [bleep] it up.

943
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:27,630
I said--I said,
don't [bleep] it up.

944
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,965
# Beep, beep

945
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:31,434
Okay, here's a tip,
you better keep them heels on

946
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:32,569
during the lip-sync.

947
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,137
Ain't no pussyfootin'
around, girl.

948
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,806
#Sad girls #

949
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:39,676
# Sad girls

950
00:39:39,676 --> 00:39:43,546
# Talking 'bout bad girls,
yeah #

951
00:39:43,546 --> 00:39:46,649
(Lashauwn)
I want to show Ru that I can
give more personality.

952
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:48,818
It's not over yet.
I'm not ready to go.

953
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:50,186
# Now you and me

954
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,554
# We're both the same #

955
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:52,655
# Both the same

956
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,190
# But you call yourself

957
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,391
# By a different names

958
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:56,626
# Different name

959
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,294
# Now your mama
won't like it #

960
00:39:58,294 --> 00:40:00,830
# When she finds out,
finds out #

961
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,566
(Princess)
I'm telling myself,
soak up this moment right now.

962
00:40:03,566 --> 00:40:04,901
Live in it.

963
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:06,135
Balls to the wall do it.

964
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:07,136
# Toot, toot

965
00:40:07,136 --> 00:40:09,138
# Hey, beep, beep

966
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,174
(Willam)
To do the whole song
with no shoes

967
00:40:11,174 --> 00:40:15,111
in closed-toed pantyhose
like a web-footed duck?

968
00:40:15,111 --> 00:40:17,780
Lashauwn's drag mother's
gonna read him for not even

969
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,516
starting the song in shoes.

970
00:40:19,516 --> 00:40:21,885
# So you want
to spend some time #

971
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:24,420
# Yeah, beep, beep

972
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,823
# Talkin' 'bout bad girls #

973
00:40:26,823 --> 00:40:28,758
# Beep, beep

974
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:29,759
# Toot, toot

975
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:30,760
# Haa

976
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,530
# Beep, beep

977
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,466
[cheers and applause]

978
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:41,204
Ladies...

979
00:40:41,204 --> 00:40:43,706
I've made my decision.

980
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:45,041
The Princess...

981
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,478
Shantay, you stay.

982
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:52,782
You may join
the other girls.

983
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:58,955
Lashauwn...

984
00:40:58,955 --> 00:41:01,191
you are a young queen.

985
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:04,527
May this experience lift you
to new heights

986
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:07,263
above and beyond.

987
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:10,767
Now sashay away.

988
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:12,268
Thank you.

989
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:19,075
It's bittersweet, but
I'm happy for me to be so young

990
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:21,978
and I've only been doing it for
such a short amount of time.

991
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:23,713
Some of these girls
being 40 and 50

992
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,682
and, so, it was sickening.

993
00:41:25,682 --> 00:41:28,718
Okay, Lashauwn gave us
the classic line:

994
00:41:28,718 --> 00:41:31,321
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend's Race,

995
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:35,091
and I gotta tell ya,
the line lives on forever!

996
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:37,093
Can I get amen up in here?

997
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:39,629
- all: Amen!
- Amen! Byee!

998
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:41,431
Let the music play!

999
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:44,434
[RuPaul's <i>The Beginning</i> plays]

1000

1001
