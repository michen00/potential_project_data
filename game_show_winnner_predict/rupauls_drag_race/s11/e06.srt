00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:02,429
[RuPaul] Previously on
RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,332
We are throwing a monster ball.

3
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,534
[howling]

4
00:00:07,535 --> 00:00:08,702
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

5
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:10,237
This looks messy.

6
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:12,539
[RuPaul] Ariel Versace.

7
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,841
There is nothing monstrous
about this.

8
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:15,842
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

9
00:00:15,843 --> 00:00:17,644
[Cara] That was incredible.

10
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:18,979
[RuPaul] Con-drag-ulations.

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

12
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,049
[Vanjie] Yes.
[applause]

13
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,685
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain,
shantay you stay.

14
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:28,855
Ariel Versace, sashay away.

15
00:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,424
Nyes.

16
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:38,832
Jesus, y'all.

17
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:41,101
This is like the worst.

18
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:42,736
But the best, but the worst.

19
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:44,972
[Shuga Cain] Miss Ariel
just went home,

20
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:47,908
and I am feeling
some type of way right now.

21
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:49,309
Ariel, we love you, Jersey.

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,577
Love you so much, Ariel.

23
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:51,645
We love you, girl.

24
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:53,880
I love you, Ariel.

25
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,316
[Shuga Cain] I thought
coming into this competition

26
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:58,819
that I was going to do so much
better than I'm doing now.

27
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,021
Bitch, they read me to filth.

28
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:03,156
And it's like, it's frustrating.

29
00:01:03,157 --> 00:01:04,992
I thought this look was cute.

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,596
How does everybody else feel
about, like, critiques, like?

31
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:11,398
I was in the bottom
for being beautiful.

32
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:13,500
So you know what?
It works for me.

33
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,935
And if I got to lip sync
for my life,

34
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,070
I'm gonna lip sync for my
motherfucking life beautifully.

35
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,572
[Yvie] But like Ru's been

36
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:21,708
particularly poignant
about don't be safe.

37
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,378
[Vanjie] I thought
what I brought was fierce.

38
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:26,646
I thought I looked sickening.
I felt sickening.

39
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,048
But I was safe.

40
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,916
[Yvie] Well, she was safe
because it was still the same

41
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:32,652
silhouette that the judges
critiqued you on changing.

42
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:33,854
Let me tell you this.

43
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,856
She wore a corset and a panty
both times.

44
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:37,791
[Yvie] I'm just saying the Tee
is that the judges already

45
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,960
critiqued you on having
the same silhouette,

46
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:42,195
so now, bitch,
time to change it up.

47
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:44,598
Ain't nobody asking for
your opinion, peanut gallery.

48
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,900
Sometimes the old school phrase

49
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,168
if you don't got
nothing nice to say,

50
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:50,971
just let those bitches go home,
sometimes that applies.

51
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:53,440
That can be hard for a lot
of people only because

52
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,108
the only thing you have
is what you brought.

53
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,344
You telling Vanjie
to step her clothes up,

54
00:01:57,345 --> 00:02:00,280
but if a person don't sew,
how does she step it up?

55
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:01,882
Start wearing pillow cases?

56
00:02:01,883 --> 00:02:03,450
Cutting up the couch?

57
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,252
They said Vanjie
bring the same silhouette,

58
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:09,022
but how can she improve
what she already has?

59
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,258
Hold on. I wore a--the first one
was a panty and a corset.

60
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,093
The second one was a gown.

61
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,062
So I didn't bring the same
silhouette three times.

62
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:16,730
I'm not fucking coming for you,

63
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:18,331
and your goddamn
same silhouette.

64
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,134
I'm just saying if you don't
want to be fucking safe again,

65
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:23,003
then change up some shit.

66
00:02:23,004 --> 00:02:24,805
Is that shit wrong?

67
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:28,141
You know everything what to say.

68
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:30,911
Once again, I hear like
these girls making excuses.

69
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:32,546
Get the fuck over it.

70
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:34,414
We have a fabric wall.

71
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,116
There's plenty of stones.

72
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:38,151
There's so many scissors.

73
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:40,187
If the judges are getting bored
by what you're doing,

74
00:02:40,188 --> 00:02:43,090
then go back into your drag
and change it.

75
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:46,126
Aight, you gonna give glamour?

76
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:47,861
My critique this week
was stay true to me, bitch.

77
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:49,629
You got quite opposite critique.

78
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,630
[Vanjie]
Mama, I heard--I heard the--

79
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:52,399
Quite opposite.

80
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,734
Don't get defensive, mama.

81
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:57,070
Miss Yvie bumps her gum all day.

82
00:02:57,071 --> 00:02:58,338
Wigs.

83
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,874
But the bitch
only gives you spooky Tee.

84
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,143
There's not much more
than spook.

85
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:06,079
And I'll tell you, wait until
they make that spooky dooky...

86
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:09,116
Go home.

87
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:13,820
[RuPaul] The winner
of RuPaul's Drag Race

88
00:03:13,821 --> 00:03:15,288
receives a one-year supply

[laughs]

98
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,780
[Brooke Lynn] It is a new day,

99
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,349
and there's still
way too many of us left here.

100
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,518
-Oh.
-Suck it, suck it.

101
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,719
It's like a house party

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,953
and people just don't know
when to leave.

103
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:50,457
Silky, how does it feel
to be in the bottom three?

[laughs]

105
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:58,198
The shade at the beginning
of the day is real, honey.

106
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,332
[Silky] You know what?

107
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,368
I don't believe
that I belong there.

108
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:03,136
I did motherfucking Evillene,

109
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:05,338
and some ho's don't know
what Evillene is.

110
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:07,541
You keep playing
on that Evillene, girl,

111
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,176
but we had three looks
on the runway.

112
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,613
It's always been drama,
'cause bitch hate on my beauty.

113
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,515
I would never be spooky,

114
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:17,817
but, bitch,
would you ever be glam?

115
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:20,020
You will never be glam!
Don't come for me.

116
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,288
Oh, girl, I hope
you're not talking to me,

117
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:24,324
'cause I'm about
to send your ass packing.

118
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:27,060
Ooh. I can't wait till we're
in the bottom two together.

119
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,562
There's a lot you don't know
about me, bitch.

120
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:29,863
[Vanjie] Thank God.

121
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:33,233
[RuPaul] She done already
done had herses.

122
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:36,503
Attention,
worldwide skorts fans.

123
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:40,941
This competition isn't just
a race, it's a marathon.

124
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:44,444
So pop the corn
and feed the children.

125
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,712
Back to you, Bob.

126
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:49,883
Hello, hello, hello.

127
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:51,384
[cheers]

128
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,386
Whew.
I've been working out.

129
00:04:56,189 --> 00:04:57,424
Whew.

130
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:58,758
I am gagged.

131
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,293
So out of breath.

133
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:04,531
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar

134
00:05:04,532 --> 00:05:07,634
needs to keep her charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

135
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:10,570
as tight as possible
at all times.

136

[all laugh]

137
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:15,775
Which is why I exercise
11 times a day

138
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:19,512
and eat three sensible meals.

139
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:20,513
Per month.

00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,351
So for today's Mini Challenge,

142
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:28,688
I'm treating you to the latest
Hollywood workout craze.

143
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,424
Galisthenics.

144
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:33,226
[all laugh]

145
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:35,662
Everybody's doing it.

146
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:37,163


147
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:39,199
Now you have 15 minutes

148
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,636
to get into your quick workout
drag, and meet me back here.

149
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:45,905

150
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:47,374
Go!

151
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,009
Oh, my God.

152
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,078
[RuPaul] Time's up, ladies.

153
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,249
You know, as a celebrity,
I have access

154
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,154
to some of the most exclusive
fitness regimes in the world.

155
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:04,591
And today I want you
to meet a person

156
00:06:04,592 --> 00:06:06,660
who has truly changed my life.

157
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:11,631
Please give a warm
Drag Race welcome to...

158
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:13,333
Love Connie.

159
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:16,736
[cheers and applause]

160
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:20,740
[Nina] I'm really familiar
with Love Connie.

161
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:23,877
Love Connie is known
for these Jane Fonda-esque

162
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:26,613
1980s-inspired
workout video looks.

163
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:29,082
It's partially scag,
it's partially improv.

164
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,850
[shouting]

165
00:06:30,851 --> 00:06:33,553
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

166
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:35,522
I want whatever she's on.

167
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:42,162
Welcome, Connie.

168
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:44,197
You girls ready to get
some hair on your tits?

169
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,266
[cheers and applause]

170
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,735
Now, girls, are you ready
to get physical?

171
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:50,403
[cheers]

172
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:54,641
Good, because the two queens
with the best moves win.

173
00:06:54,642 --> 00:06:56,142
Let's go.

174
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:00,747
I don't know about you,

175
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,516
but I'm ready
for some thigh workouts.

176
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:05,819
[cheers]

177
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,220
Let's do it.

178
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,357
Now, feel it working
through your cleavage.

179
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,026
That way
you don't have to contour

180
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,794
and you can save on makeup.

181
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:16,363
All right, step it out.

182
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:19,065
And lunge, lunge, lunge.

183
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:23,103
Keep it going. [coughs]

184
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:25,238
-[laughs]
-Keep going.

185
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,140
I didn't say stop.
Oh, my God.

186
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,409
Who wants a solo?

187
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,177
-Jean jacket, I love you.
-Yes, I love you.

188
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:33,780
Oh, my God, you make me feel
feminine with that beard.

189
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:36,449
[all laugh]

190
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,988
Let's Nomi Malone it.
Hup, hup, hup.

191
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:43,289
It's all you.

192
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,693
[Yvie]
I just love watching Scarlet

193
00:07:46,694 --> 00:07:48,194
get an opportunity to dance.

194
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:50,196
It's so ridiculous.

195
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:52,565
[laughs]
-Oh!

196
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:55,368
Bluebird, are you
gonna be all right?

197
00:07:55,369 --> 00:07:56,669
I don't want you
to get any black eyes.

198
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,772
I wanna see long legs.

199
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:01,908
Whoa! Oh, my God! Whoa!

200
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,510
Yeah!

201
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,245
It's Pinky Tuscadero.

202
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,247
[all laugh]

203
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:10,717
And hit it.
It's kick, kick.

204
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:12,352
Up to the glory of God.

205
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,354
Hey, Jesus. Again.

206
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:17,657
Hup, hup. This bitch
is trying outkick me.

207
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,993
I quit, I quit.

208
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:21,161
Last place.

209
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:22,929
I smell something burning.

210
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,197
It must be Plastique.

211
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,965
Come on down, girl.

212
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:27,901
Whoo. Get it.

213
00:08:27,902 --> 00:08:30,703
Oh, my God! Wow!

214
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:33,473
I didn't need those
anyway, honey.

215
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:34,474
Oh, my God.

216
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:36,209
Oh, my Lord.

217
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:38,478
Whoo! Let's curl.

218
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,480
That's not gonna make me
look masculine, right?

219
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:41,648
No, but your face will.

220
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,250
[Vanjie] Ow!

221
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:47,153
Whoa! Oh, my God!

222
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,459
Let's do checkerboard, yes.

223
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,060
I am not being racist.

224
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:55,261
Hey, girl.

225
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,230
Whoo! Wow!

226
00:08:57,231 --> 00:09:00,033
We're gonna jump out
and thrust, thrust.

227
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:02,869
Out, and thrust, thrust. Out.

228
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,605
Give me a limp wrist.
I need it gayer.

229
00:09:05,606 --> 00:09:07,974
All original.
Come on, let's do it.

230
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:12,112
Hup and hup and hup
and hup and hup.

231
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:15,482
Whoa!

232
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:24,457
Hup and push. Now give it.
You're the last girl.

233
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,293
Take it, girl.
You can still win this.

234
00:09:27,294 --> 00:09:28,862
You can still win it.

235
00:09:28,863 --> 00:09:31,498
I want a winner.

236
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:33,333
Get it! Get it!

237
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,301
Yes!
[slap]

238
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:36,636
[laughs]

239
00:09:36,637 --> 00:09:38,738
That'll get ya.
I needed that.

240
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:39,939
I needed it.

241
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,109
All right, everybody,
let's rock it out.

242
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,626
[RuPaul] Y'all worked that body.

243
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:00,827
[cheers]

244
00:10:00,828 --> 00:10:04,898
But two of you really
made me feel the burn,

245
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,634
and I've got an ointment
that will knock that right out.

246
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,069
Connie, would you do the honors?

247
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,471
I would love to.

248
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:15,141
The two winners of
this workout challenge are...

249
00:10:16,276 --> 00:10:18,144
A'Keria.

250
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:20,046

Thank you, Connie, darling.

258
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:40,600
You can leave
the way you came in.

259
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:43,803
As they say in Hollywood,
I think I will.

260
00:10:43,804 --> 00:10:47,307
[laughter and applause]

261
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,614

A'Keria and Plastique,

277
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:37,957
so you are the team leaders.

278
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,959
A'Keria, you go first.

279
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,762
I'm gonna go
with Brooke Lynn Hytes.

280
00:11:42,763 --> 00:11:44,864
Thank you.

Thank God.

-Nina West.
-Yay.

291
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:08,855
That leaves Scarlet Envy
and Shuga Cain.

292
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:10,523
Give me some of that Shuga.

293
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:11,991
Yay.

294
00:12:11,992 --> 00:12:16,629
And that means Scarlet Envy,
you are Team Plastique.

295
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,464
Yes.
[applause]

296
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:21,134
Errr! Put the brakes on,

297
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,836
because Scarlet is on our team,
and we are in trouble.

298
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:26,472
S.O.S. She's not a dancer.

299
00:12:26,473 --> 00:12:27,874
Help.

300
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:31,577
Now, ladies, the Draglympics
are an international event.

301
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,579
Very prestigious.

302
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,214
Did I say puss-tigious?

303
00:12:35,215 --> 00:12:36,382
[all laugh]

304
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,518
Very puss-tigious.

305
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,620
[all laugh]

306
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:43,456
So Team A'Keria,
you'll be representing

307
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:46,826
the sovereign nation
of Tuckpantistan.

308
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:48,828
Ooh.

309
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:51,664
And Team Plastique,
you'll be representing

310
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:54,467
the People's Republic
of Glamazonia.

311
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:56,869
Nice.

312
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,137
And you'll be coached

313
00:12:58,138 --> 00:13:02,542
by Emmy Award-winning
choreographer Travis Wall.

314
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:04,077
-Yes!
-[gasps]

315
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,214
And U.S. Olympic
figure skating champion

316
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:09,682
Adam Rippon.

317
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:12,085
[cheers and applause]

318
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:15,755
Gentlemen of the world,
start your engines,

319
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:18,458
and may the best woman win.

320
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:19,792
[cheers and applause]

321
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

322
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:22,428
I'm worried.

323
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:24,497
There's too many iffies
in this group.

324
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:25,565
We got Scarlet.

325
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:29,001
We got Nina.
She ain't a dancer.

326
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,737
She ain't solid gold,
and this ain't comedy.

327
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,472
Ra'Jah, temperamental.

328
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:34,607
This ain't America's
best dance crew right here.

329
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:36,242
We can't even make
the auditions.

330
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:38,978
We are fucked.

331
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:42,048
[Vanjie] Lead us to victory.
Win this Olympic medal, bitch.

332
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,050
-We're taking the gold home.
-Yes.

333
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:45,618
For this week's Maxi Challenge,

334
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:48,087
we have to perform
in the Draglympics.

335
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,156
[Plastique] This challenge
is super physical,

336
00:13:50,157 --> 00:13:51,958
but I'm so excited for it

337
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:52,959
because I can
buck the house down.

338
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,695
Gakita, gakita, ga-ga-ga.

339
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:58,397
When Ru said choreographer,
I was like, wait, oh, no, bitch.

340
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,967
Not again.

341
00:14:00,968 --> 00:14:03,669
-Up, one, two--
-Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,737
Ra'Jah,
you shouldn't have told me

343
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:08,174
you had this dance
experience, mama.

344
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:10,042
I'm going back into
my Kameron Michaels shell.

345
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:12,044
I have never seen
a dance floor at all.

346
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,613
-I've never done nothing.
-Right.

347
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:15,581
I am the Tee
when it comes to dancing,

348
00:14:15,582 --> 00:14:17,984
but after working with
the other choreographer,

349
00:14:17,985 --> 00:14:18,985
I really don't know
what to expect.

350
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:20,019
Oh!

351
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,420
I'm shook.

352
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,256
[Scarlet] I'm just a little
nervous for myself.

353
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:25,358
We all know I can't dance.

354
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,726
I mean, I haven't done
a lot of death drops,

355
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,928
but if I don't do it well
but I do it,

356
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:31,864
and they know how out
of that comfort zone it is,

357
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:34,367
I think that might
speak for itself?

358
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:36,669
No, because if you
still do a death drop

359
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,171
and you don't do it well,

360
00:14:38,172 --> 00:14:39,705
I think they're going to be
like, what the hell was that?

361
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,442
-I was the last picked.
-One, two, three, four.

362
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:46,279
And I can tell that none of them
wanted me on the team.

363
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,246
Out. Out?

364
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,216
So that's a hard place
to start from.

365
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:53,953
Help, literally, help.

366
00:14:53,954 --> 00:14:56,389
I did choose my team
for a reason.

367
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,790
I wanted to pick people

368
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,293
who I know actually
can pick up choreography.

369
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:03,429
And even if you can't, you know
how to make it look good.

370
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,797
[Brooke Lynn]
My team is feeling really good

371
00:15:04,798 --> 00:15:06,933
going into
the Draglympics challenge,

372
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:08,768
but I'm a little worried

373
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:11,604
about the drama
between Yvie and Silky.

374
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,539
Now, are you two going to
be okay working together,

375
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,874
because we got a little heated
this morning.

376
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,345
We have to address this issue.

377
00:15:19,346 --> 00:15:21,414
Because at this point in time,
we are a team,

378
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:24,417
and we're all on a mission.

379
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,987
I can put all
my personal things aside.

380
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:31,090
Like this is work for me,
so like, I'm coming into work.

381
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,558
Okay. I just wanted to check.
We're not gonna have any--

382
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,960
[A'Keria]
Yeah, because it's five of us,

383
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,128
and I think everybody's aim

384
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:38,431
is they're trying to be their
number one or their top three,

385
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:41,267
because that's what's
gonna get us through this.

386
00:15:41,268 --> 00:15:43,870
Look, I don't want
any drama going forth.

387
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,204
Like, I don't have time
for the B.S.

388
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:46,772
We trying to win.

389
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:49,108
Now, if y'all wanna slice
each other's throat afterward,

390
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:51,077
by all means.

391
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,080
But as of right now, we're
not finna have none of that.

392
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,182
So do anybody have
any special skills?

393
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:58,084
-I mean--
-Ballet.

394
00:15:58,085 --> 00:16:00,353
Yeah, I know
you have your baton.

395
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:03,189
That could be incorporated
into some type of hand motion.

396
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,992
-I got a trick or two.
-Yeah, you do?

397
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,193
She a bendy girl.

398
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,028
[Yvie] Any given
performance of mine,

399
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,864
you can expect me
to be flying from the ceiling,

400
00:16:11,865 --> 00:16:15,968
hanging off of something,
contorting into boxes.

401
00:16:15,969 --> 00:16:17,536
I was born super flexible

402
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,772
because I don't produce
a whole lot of collagen,

403
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:22,475
so my joints go every which way.

404
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:24,644
[A'Keria] Do you think that
you could teach somebody

405
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,812
who, you know,
ain't as nimble as you--

406
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:27,813
[Yvie] Yeah, the shablam?

407
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,248
-[A'Keria] Yeah, that.
-Yeah.

408
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:30,650
The shablam is what
you're supposed to do,

409
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,451
which is supposed to be
kind of like a surprise.

410
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:35,121
So it should come out
of like a twirl,

411
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:36,656
and then you just
bend your knee down,

412
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:40,259
and you find your way
to the floor and point.

413
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,427
[Brooke Lynn]
Show me how to do that.

414
00:16:41,428 --> 00:16:43,129
I'm very ballerina,

415
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,465
so I don't really like just
throw myself into things.

416
00:16:46,466 --> 00:16:47,867
Like death drops terrify me.

417
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:49,068
Which way do you go
when you turn?

418
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:51,570
When I turn,
I turn to the outside.

419
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,572
So you go bam, bam, bam.

420
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:56,275
And then whatever leg
you are going to be falling on

421
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:58,077
is the leg
you should be spinning on.

422
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,345
I could do that.

423
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:00,546
[Yvie] Yeah, girl.

424
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,682
Oh, no, I'm not doing it
on that concrete, baby.

425
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,650
Y'all keep the concrete
right now.

426
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:06,852
I am not a dancer,

427
00:17:06,853 --> 00:17:09,722
but I have a team
full of dancers,

428
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:11,390
and now I have to lead them
to victory.

429
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:14,961
My goal is to show those judges
that I can be a leader.

430
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:18,130
-Hi.
-Hi.

431
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:20,599
[Yvie] It's time to rehearse
our choreography

432
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,435
for the Draglympics.

433
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:23,869
Not only do we have an Olympian,

434
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,473
but we have an Emmy
Award-winning choreographer.

435
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:28,975
I'm feeling so solid.

436
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:31,544
[Travis] Yes.

437
00:17:31,545 --> 00:17:32,878
We're stealing that move today.

438
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,314
I'm here to give you a show,
so you want a good show?

439
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:36,849
I'm gonna come find you, yes.

440
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,117
No, you found me.

441
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:39,452
[all laugh]

442
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:40,553
I'm ready.

443
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:41,988
[Travis]
This is the Draglympics.

444
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,923
There's three
compulsory elements in this,

445
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,591
so we have to all
dance with fans,

446
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:47,193
and then we all have to vogue,

447
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,562
and then we all have to have
some version of a shablam.

448
00:17:49,563 --> 00:17:53,032
Whatever the dance is,
you guys need to sell it.

449
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,967
It's a performance.

450
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,168
[Travis] So we're going
to start teaching you

451
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:57,670
a little bit
of the fanography first.

452
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,572
Please come grab a Daftboy fan.

453
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:05,544
You're going to take the fan,
one, point, two.

454
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:09,181
Three. You're going
to open your fan on four.

455
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:13,052
Five, six, you're going
to turn and close the fan.

456
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:14,820
And then you're going to open it

457
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,222
and do arched back on eight.

458
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,491
One fan down.
Here we go.

459
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,626
Boom, two, three, four.

460
00:18:20,627 --> 00:18:22,995
Five, six, seven, back.

461
00:18:22,996 --> 00:18:24,497
-How'd you do?
-Great.

462
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:25,631
Slapped myself.

463
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:26,665
A'Keria, would you do it
by yourself?

464
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:27,666
Yeah, I sure can try it.

465
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,702
Five, six, seven, and...

466
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:31,637
-Step, cross, three.
-One, two.

467
00:18:31,638 --> 00:18:34,940
Then keep going.
One, two, three, four.

468
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:36,409
-Now fan on four.
-Okay, fan on four.

469
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,810
[Travis] That was almost it,
yeah.

470
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,478
Now, I can pop a fan
all day long.

471
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,548
But to pop a fan
and remember to move this way

472
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:45,518
and step with this foot
and then do this hand...

473
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,854
Don't get in your head.

474
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:51,924
Just like, relax,
and even if you do mess up,

475
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,893
don't make
any sort of like facial.

476
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:55,761
-Right.
-If you give like a facial,

477
00:18:55,762 --> 00:18:58,064
everybody's gonna know
when you're like uh-uh-uh.

478
00:18:58,065 --> 00:18:59,899
[Travis] All right,
so let's learn

479
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,400
some of the voguing section.

480
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:04,403
Touch and a release.
Touch and release.

481
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,472
So, bitch,
get out of my way, ha.

482
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:08,808
Think about touch this skin,
darling.

483
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:09,842
Brooke Lynn, can you do it once?

484
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,044
-Sure.
-Five, six, sell it, great.

485
00:19:12,045 --> 00:19:14,013
One and a two,
three and a four,

486
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:15,714
and a right and a left
and a right and a left.

487
00:19:15,715 --> 00:19:16,982
And a circle to the back,

488
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:19,585
circle to the hip,
step and pull, step and pull.

489
00:19:19,586 --> 00:19:21,387
Brooke Lynn, that looks so good.

490
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:23,055
-It's sick.
-Thank you.

491
00:19:23,056 --> 00:19:25,224
Everyone has to come up to
your level, but it looks good.

492
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:28,994
My eye's gonna be on Brooke Lynn
to see what she can deliver,

493
00:19:28,995 --> 00:19:31,097
because we're expecting a lot.

494
00:19:31,098 --> 00:19:33,699
From there, you're going
to go one, snap, two.

495
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,168
Three, snap, four.
Five, snap, six.

496
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:37,937
Now, seven and an eight, and ha.

497
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:39,472
You're going take it
all the way to the floor.

498
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:40,573
[A'Keria] I need help.

499
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:42,608
So, listen,
this is not a death drop.

500
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:46,479
The idea is it's a smooth
transition to the floor.

501
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,881
Travis is telling me
to go down graceful.

502
00:19:48,882 --> 00:19:50,249
It's like a whoo.

503
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,350
Bitch, there's no graceful.

504
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:52,685
There's a pam!

505
00:19:52,686 --> 00:19:54,353
Or you won't get nothing,
honey.

506
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:57,857
Silky, here we go.
Five, six, seven, and.

507
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:00,926
Go step, ha, ah, mm, ah.

508
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,561
Circle to the back.

509
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:06,465
Yeah, girl.
[cheers and applause]

510
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:07,566
So everyone get to the floor.

511
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,268
We're gonna do a little
five and six

512
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:10,436
to cross your legs,

513
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:11,670
Then you're going
to whip around.

514
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:13,572
Seven, eight,
to the right knee down,

515
00:20:13,573 --> 00:20:15,641
and then you're going
to pull up on one.

516
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:16,876
Let me see it from the floor.

517
00:20:16,877 --> 00:20:20,079
Boom, ha, ha, seven,
and back one.

518
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,616
Come up, flick, flick,
down, through, and go.

519
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:26,152
Not bad. Maybe
this becomes your solo,

520
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,120
and they get up on one,
and then we all come around you.

521
00:20:28,121 --> 00:20:29,388
-Uh-huh, I'm gonna get up.
-Okay.

522
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,390
-Imma get it.
-Yes, you are.

523
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:33,792
I'm a big bitch, but
I ain't not scared big bitch.

524
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:37,229
Here we go, back on one.
Six, seven, eight.

525
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,999
Back one, two, come up,
three, four.

526
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,435
Go flick, flick, down,
through, drop, come up.

527
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:45,104
That was a disaster.

528
00:20:45,105 --> 00:20:46,572
Let's do that one more time.

529
00:20:46,573 --> 00:20:48,240
Silky's flopping around
on the floor

530
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:51,343
looking like
The Greatest Catch. [laughs]

531
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:53,479
The thing about Silky
is she fucking works it.

532
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,515
She's like, yeah, I look crazy,
but I'm doing it.

533
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,384
And the bitch is committed.

534
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,286
I feel like
a skinny bitch today.

535
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,687
[Brooke Lynn]
Maybe you will be by tomorrow.

536
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:06,826
[all laugh]

537
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:09,361
Silky, she's gonna
have to work really hard

538
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:10,896
to keep up with everybody else
in her group,

539
00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:14,099
but that personality alone,
she's explosive.

540
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,001
And I think that
she's going to do

541
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:17,203
really well
in this challenge.

542
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:18,437
One more time to the floor.

543
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:22,007
Come up, flick, flick,
down, through, and go.

544
00:21:22,008 --> 00:21:24,143
Not bad.
Yvie, you okay?

545
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:29,114
I'm going to have to cheat
specifically the turn today.

546
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:31,650
Tomorrow I can do death drops,
splits, kicks, everything.

547
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:35,855
[Yvie] During rehearsals,
I'm a little bit rattled

548
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:38,757
by the fact that
all of my joints are hurting.

549
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:42,695
But I'm just gonna have
to grind through it.

550
00:21:42,696 --> 00:21:43,696
Thank you, guys,
for your hard work.

551
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:44,830
I really appreciate it.

552
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:46,732
I want to push you guys
as far as possible,

553
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:48,000
so there's a lot to do.

554
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,335
I'm just so thankful

555
00:21:49,336 --> 00:21:51,570
that all of you guys
have some rhythm in you.

556
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:54,773
Some seasons, it's like,
oh, it's like Bambi and...

557
00:21:54,774 --> 00:21:56,141
Bitch, you gonna hate
the next team.

558
00:21:56,142 --> 00:21:58,277
Oh, you gonna be angry.

559
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,813
[all laugh]

560
00:22:00,814 --> 00:22:02,414
Yvie, can I talk to you
for a second?

561
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:03,549
-Yeah.
-Cool.

562
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,985
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

563
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:08,387
It's just I want to give myself
one more day to rest, though.

564
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:09,555
What happened to it?

565
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:10,656
Like was it just from
the last challenge or...

566
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:13,392
Yeah, it was just
from the last challenge,

567
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:15,928
I was standing in heels
for all day.

568
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:18,097
Okay. I don't want to, like,
take it to the next level

569
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:19,598
where you're not going
to be part of the competition.

570
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,768
[Yvie] Because of my condition,

571
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:27,139
I know that I shouldn't be doing
all of my contortions right now.

572
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,942
I just would
rather not bring it up,

573
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:32,578
because I don't want
to be babied.

574
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:35,247
Just make sure, like,
stay as honest as possible,

575
00:22:35,248 --> 00:22:36,382
and then we're going
to get through this.

576
00:22:36,383 --> 00:22:37,383
-All right.
-Awesome.

577
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:38,751
-Thank you so much.
-Take care.

578
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:41,787
[Yvie] I'm frustrated
having to hold myself back

579
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:44,123
because I didn't come here
to play safe.

580
00:22:44,124 --> 00:22:45,991
Safe gets you sent home.

581
00:22:48,861 --> 00:22:50,663
-Hi.
-Hi.

582
00:22:50,664 --> 00:22:52,698
-Hey.
-There go the boys.

583
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:54,800
This challenge in particular
I'm excited for

584
00:22:54,801 --> 00:22:56,168
because I started out
my drag career

585
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:58,604
in backup dancing
for all those chickenheads.

586
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:01,540
Like I'm excited, and I feel
like I can do good with this.

587
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:02,908
At this point,
I know I have to stand out,

588
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:04,176
'cause I want to win something.

589
00:23:04,177 --> 00:23:05,277
What we're going to do first

590
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:06,912
is we're going
to work on the voguing.

591
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:09,815
So let's learn these hands.
This is going to be fun.

592
00:23:09,816 --> 00:23:11,450
Up and out, up and out,

593
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,419
and a voom, badda-ba,
badda-boom, badda-ba.

594
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,856
Five, six, seven,
and up and out, up and out.

595
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:20,092
And an up and a down,
and an up and a down.

596
00:23:20,093 --> 00:23:23,128
Nice. I just want more body.

597
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:25,331
Ra'Jah, one more time.
Five, six, seven.

598
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:28,267
And up and an out,
up and an out,

599
00:23:28,268 --> 00:23:30,169
and a boom, tadda-ba,
badda-boom, badda-ba.

600
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,471
And a hip and a hip,
and a step and a back.

601
00:23:32,472 --> 00:23:35,207
Five, six, seven, and boom.

602
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,810
[cheers]
[Scarlet] Good work.

603
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:40,980
That's really great
comparatively to everybody else.

604
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,247
But I still want you
to push yourself further.

605
00:23:42,248 --> 00:23:44,350
-Okay.
-Vanjie, can you show me?

606
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:47,486
Five, six, boom-tadda-da,
boom-tadda-da.

607
00:23:47,487 --> 00:23:49,521
And an up and a down
and an up and a down.

608
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,824
And a boom, boom,
step, ha.

609
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:55,294
Five, six, seven, and ha.
Amazing.

610
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:56,462
I have no notes.

611
00:23:56,463 --> 00:23:58,464
I'm coming for you, Ra'Jah.

612
00:23:58,465 --> 00:23:59,999
[all laugh]

613
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Next up we're going
to work on the fanography,

614
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,936
so please come grab a fan.

615
00:24:03,937 --> 00:24:05,504
Guess who's back in the house.

616
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:07,005
[pop, pop]

617
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:10,109
Five, six, seven, ha.

618
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,577
You're going to step across.

619
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:14,880
One, you're going to pull
the fan across on two,

620
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:18,917
then you're going to step three,
you're going to swipe on four.

621
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:22,154
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, jump, eight.

622
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:25,157
Step past eight,
step to the out.

623
00:24:25,158 --> 00:24:29,495
Step across.
Feet, feet, a knock-knock, go.

624
00:24:29,496 --> 00:24:31,764
Know exactly
what the fan is doing.

625
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:34,032
Your execution score
is going to up or down

626
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,568
dependent on what these fans
are doing.

627
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:38,904
-Scarlet.
-Oh, God.

628
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:40,839
Ready? Here we go.
Seven, jump, eight.

629
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,509
One and two, three and four.

630
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:48,147
Five and six, seven, eight,
one and two.

631
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:50,282
Let's try it again.
It's like, snap.

632
00:24:50,283 --> 00:24:51,550
Give me that.
Just do that part.

633
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:53,652
On two. One, hop.

634
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,921
I just want to see this.

635
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:57,389
One, hop.

636
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,824
Act like you're in drag, girls.
It's a snap.

637
00:24:58,825 --> 00:24:59,758
Give me something there.

638
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:03,362
-It was not very good.
-No.

639
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:04,730
-But we're gonna get there.
-Okay.

640
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:07,166
Scarlet
is definitely the weakest.

641
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:09,768
However, why do I feel
like she's gonna, like,

642
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,504
come forward tomorrow
and like win the challenge?

643
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:15,207
One and two, three and four.
You lost it.

644
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:17,209
Let's try again.

645
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,812
Of course we still have
the struggle bus with Scarlet.

646
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:20,813
[Travis] And up.

647
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:21,814
In the way.

648
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:23,348
Oh, I'm sorry.

649
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:25,884
[Ra'Jah] Bitch, could you find
your spot so I can get in mine?

650
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:28,454
Thank you. Move, bitch.

651
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,222
Here we go.
This is our last time.

652
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:31,790
Then we gotta wrap it up.
Here we go.

653
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,759
Five, six, seven, go.

654
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,162
In, up, out, down, hit,
through, oh, my God.

655
00:25:37,163 --> 00:25:38,997
I thought someone
was going to get it.

656
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:40,799
No one did, though.

657
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,435
All I know is
I'm looking at Travis's face,

658
00:25:43,436 --> 00:25:45,971
and he looks like he just saw
Michael Jackson's ghost.

659
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:47,239
Out of the two groups,

660
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,908
you guys did have a harder time
picking up choreography,

661
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:51,810
but you have to get those steps.

662
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:54,246
Those steps are part of
your compulsory elements.

663
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,381
This is becoming a disaster.

664
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:59,251
I'm praying that
these girls get hit

665
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:00,819
by the Rhythm Nation stick.

666
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,255
This was my chance
to do something good.

667
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:04,990
Like what did I do
to deserve this?

668
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:12,431
-Silky, why you fart?
-Did you fart?

669
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:14,766
You farted.
Yes, you did, bitch.

670
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,001
You nasty bitch.

671
00:26:16,002 --> 00:26:19,137
Today is the Draglympics.

672
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:24,109
We got to do fanography,
vogueography, and shablam.

673
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,412
Oh, get my wig, girl,
get my wig!

674
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:28,680
[Ra'Jah]
Come on twerk.

675
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:30,649
-Come on, pancake.
-[Silky]I'm coming in.

676
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,984
Come on, pancake.

677
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:33,886
[Vanjie] This why
I love y'all nasty ho's.

678
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,588
They got an ass
but I got a stomach.

679
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,190
[all laugh]

680
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:39,358
[Vanjie]
Oh, Lord, Jesus.

681
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,093
How do you feel
about your team, bitch?

682
00:26:41,094 --> 00:26:45,998
Girl, you know some of us
are not as strong dancers,

683
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:48,800
but I have to make sure
I'm doing my part.

684
00:26:48,801 --> 00:26:50,469
You know my theory.
You got it,

685
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,671
or lip sync for your
motherfucking life.

686
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:54,273
Yeah.

687
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:56,208
[Vanjie] It's important for
me to do well in this challenge

688
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:57,543
because I've been close,

689
00:26:57,544 --> 00:27:00,512
but I haven't been able
to like hit the home runs.

690
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:01,914
[Silky]
I can't wait to see

691
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:03,348
what you're going to wear
on this runway, bitch.

692
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:04,349
[Vanjie]
Sometimes I don't think

693
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,551
my runways go over that well,

694
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:07,619
So I need to make sure
I at least sell it

695
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,588
and am confident on the runway.

696
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,390
I want to do it,
one, for Mama Ru,

697
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:12,724
because, you know,
she brought me back,

698
00:27:12,725 --> 00:27:14,993
and I feel like I been
letting her down a little bit.

699
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:17,696
Uh-uh.

700
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,372
Just like, lately,

701
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:29,274
I've been feeling like
I haven't been improving,

702
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:32,244
like, girl, we're like halfway
through the competition,

703
00:27:32,245 --> 00:27:33,545
I haven't even won
a Mini Challenge.

704
00:27:33,546 --> 00:27:36,081
I feel like
it's a lot of expectations

705
00:27:36,082 --> 00:27:38,750
from like a lot of people.

706
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:42,187
I don't...like, I feel like
I should be doing better.

707
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:48,060
So it frustrates me
because I know what I can do.

708
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:52,631
And I feel like I just have
been like kind of scared.

709
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,934
Like I'm like, bitch,
I need to do something,

710
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:58,904
because I want people to know
that I'm not like here

711
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,672
just to kiki and hang out
you know.

712
00:28:00,673 --> 00:28:02,207
We all came to do--

713
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:04,643
-A job.
-To perform our best, yeah.

714
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:07,212
Trust me, you're doing just
what you're supposed to do,

715
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:09,348
which is each day
handle each challenge

716
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:12,050
the way you're supposed to,
and continue to fight in this.

717
00:28:12,051 --> 00:28:13,118
Yeah.

718
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,419
[Vanjie] I'm frustrated
with myself

719
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,623
because I know
what Yvie said was true.

720
00:28:17,624 --> 00:28:20,125
Like I need to step it up,
because I've been safe.

721
00:28:25,197 --> 00:28:27,566
Brooke Lynn, babe,
how did you get started in drag?

722
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:31,269
I started doing drag
professionally when I was 25.

723
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,738
And I moved to New York,

724
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,506
and I danced
with Ballet Trockadero.

725
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:37,242
Oh, yes. I have some friends
in Trockadero.

726
00:28:37,243 --> 00:28:39,544
[Brooke Lynn] Ballet Trockadero
de Monte Carlo,

727
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:42,347
it's an all-male ballet company,
and they do drag.

728
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:45,651
So I got to be a ballerina for
four years and travel the world.

729
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:48,687
I performed for royalty,
performed for Karl Lagerfeld,

730
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:50,656
Princess Caroline of Monaco.

731
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:54,159
So that was a life-changing
experience for me.

732
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,661
I danced there for four years.

733
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:57,729
So fierce.
I love that.

734
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:02,034
[Shuga]
So how you feeling, girl?

735
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:05,504
I know your body was kind of
messing with you today.

736
00:29:05,505 --> 00:29:08,774
Honestly,
I have this joint disorder

737
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:12,344
that gives me all of these
crazy flexible abilities.

738
00:29:12,345 --> 00:29:13,812
But it's a double-edged sword

739
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:15,847
because some days I wake up

740
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:19,985
and I can just feel my bones,
like, sliding apart.

741
00:29:19,986 --> 00:29:21,920
Oh, shit.

742
00:29:21,921 --> 00:29:25,257
And that's how I felt
the day we got this challenge.

743
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:28,260
I felt my body being like, girl,
today is not the day.

744
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:32,864
[Yvie] Growing up,
my bones were always hurting

745
00:29:32,865 --> 00:29:34,966
to an unnecessary amount.

746
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,836
We thought it was
growing pains.

747
00:29:37,837 --> 00:29:41,306
I remember being like 13 or 14

748
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:44,142
when I finally got,
like, the full diagnosis

749
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:46,678
of what exactly
is going on with my body.

750
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:47,713
[Nina]
What is it called?

751
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:49,881
It's called Ehlers-Danlos.

752
00:29:49,882 --> 00:29:51,450
Oh, wow.

753
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:53,685
And it's just, my body
doesn't produce enough collagen,

754
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:56,054
which is why
I've got all of these

755
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:58,557
and all of this at 24.

756
00:29:58,558 --> 00:29:59,758
[Nina] Really?

757
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,160
My condition is something
that is eventually

758
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:06,431
going to take me out
of drag commission,

759
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:09,468
at least in the way
that I'm doing it now.

760
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,503
Is it not curable?
Is that what it--

761
00:30:11,504 --> 00:30:13,472
It just gets worse and worse
over time.

762
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:16,308
I met somebody who has
the same disease as me

763
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:17,375
and is 10 years older.

764
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:18,610
They're in a wheelchair.

765
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:20,846
-They have heart complications.
-Are you serious?

766
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:24,316
So I get to like--I get like
a little vision of my future.

767
00:30:24,317 --> 00:30:27,819
Mama, I'm so sorry.
That's so wild.

768
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,488
[Yvie] That's why every year
I've auditioned for Drag Race.

769
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:31,523
I was like, I have
to get on this year.

770
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:32,824
I have to do it,
because I'm like,

771
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:35,994
I'm losing my skills as I go on.

772
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:37,729
Does it bother you,
like, a lot of the time?

773
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,564
It's always kind of there.

774
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:41,500
Like, I'm literally
always in pain.

775
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:44,402
It's just
it's not always at a 10.

776
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:46,505
It's usually at
like a four or five.

777
00:30:46,506 --> 00:30:48,006
Even though drag is something

778
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:49,508
that's been really hard
on my body,

779
00:30:49,509 --> 00:30:50,609
and it's definitely something

780
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,612
I'm not going to be able
to do forever,

781
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:55,881
it's so liberating

782
00:30:55,882 --> 00:30:58,683
that if I have to go
out on stage in a wheelchair,

783
00:30:58,684 --> 00:30:59,751
girl, like, I'll do it.

784
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,724
She has all this pain,
but have you seen the bitch?

785
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:08,960
She acts like nothing is wrong.

You never know
what someone's going through.

787
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:13,965
So for those of us who don't
have weird joint disorders,

00:43:09,348 --> 00:43:10,815
that I am ready to slay.

1040
00:43:10,816 --> 00:43:13,985
I am an Aztec goddess warrior
today, honey.

1041
00:43:13,986 --> 00:43:15,686
This look is classic Shuga.

1042
00:43:15,687 --> 00:43:17,455
My body is right.

1043
00:43:17,456 --> 00:43:20,091
I'm showing you the gold
and the shimmer, bitch.

1044
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:21,759
I live for a sparkle, honey.

1045
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,994
[Travis]
The eagle has landed.

1046
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:24,662
-[Rupaul] Yes.
-[Adam] Beautiful.

1047
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:27,031
[Michelle]
It's the flight of bitcheress.

1048
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:28,733
[all laugh]

1049
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:30,835
[RuPaul] Plastique Tiara.

1050
00:43:30,836 --> 00:43:33,971
[Adam] She can watch Drag Race
from space with those antennas.

1051
00:43:33,972 --> 00:43:35,273
[Plastique]
This look is like Plastique

1052
00:43:35,274 --> 00:43:38,376
like evolved
into mega evolution.

1053
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,378
This is the ultimate
Plastique form.

1054
00:43:40,379 --> 00:43:42,613
I'm feeling
my Alyssa Edwards fantasy,

1055
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:44,415
where she's got 25 things on
at once.

1056
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,418
I'm feeling the best I've ever
felt walking down this runway.

1057
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:48,853
[Mirai] Have I died
and gone to heaven?

1058
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:50,888
[Travis] Light as a feather,
stiff as a strap-on.

1059
00:43:50,889 --> 00:43:52,290
[all laugh]

1060
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,125
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

1061
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:57,261
[Michelle] I was wondering
where my other ball went.

1062
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,397
[all laugh]

1063
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:01,465
[Ra'Jah]
I'm serving you this catsuit

1064
00:44:01,466 --> 00:44:02,900
that I actually made myself.

1065
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:06,070
I'm feeling my head to toe
shimmer and sparkle.

1066
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:08,139
Mary J. Blige at the Met Gala

1067
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,241
meets old money, baby.

1068
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:11,809

[all laugh]

1074
00:44:20,018 --> 00:44:21,886
[Adam] Ooh, she's got
somewhere to go.

1075
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,857
[Vanjie] Miss Vanjie all
gold glitter robot bunny ho.

1076
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:30,227
My thighs is out, legs is long.

1077
00:44:30,228 --> 00:44:32,196
I'm corseted for the guys.

1078
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:34,432
I can't feel my genitals.

1079
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:36,400
Robotic pussy shit.

1080
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:39,236
I don't even know, child.
I just look good, baby.

1081
00:44:39,237 --> 00:44:41,339
[Adam] 24 carrots.
[RuPaul] Yeah.

1083
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:43,708
[Mirai]
I think I'm in love.

1084
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,910
[Travis]
The future Mrs. Hefner.

1085
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:47,411
-Well...
-Not much future in that.

1086
00:44:47,412 --> 00:44:48,980
-No.
-No.

1087
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:50,481
[RuPaul] Nina West.

[Michelle]
A striking Viking.

1089
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:53,517
[Adam] I'm feeling horny.

1090
00:44:53,518 --> 00:44:57,488
[Nina] This is a quintessential
Nordic Nina, yah.

1091
00:44:57,489 --> 00:44:59,357
I don't think I've ever seen
anything like this

1092
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:00,791
saunter down
the Drag Race stage.

1093
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:03,127
Remember, it ain't over
till the fat lady sings.

[RuPaul] Scarlet Envy.

1097
00:45:09,368 --> 00:45:10,601
[Travis] Death becomes her.

1098

Calling Dr. Bombay.

1107
00:45:33,225 --> 00:45:36,027

00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,929
[Michelle]
Butterflies, oh, no.

1109
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,498
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

1110
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:45,136
You all did
an outstanding job tonight,

1111
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:47,505
and you've made my job
very difficult.

1112
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:50,174
[RuPaul] The winning team is...

1113
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:57,381
From Tuckpantistan,
Team A'Keria.

1114

-Good job, y'all.
-Yeah, bitch. Congrats.

You are all my sheroes,

1117
00:46:04,523 --> 00:46:07,625
but one of you
earned Draglympic gold.

1118
00:46:09,293 --> 00:46:11,128
A'Keria, con-drag-ulations.

1119
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:13,264
You are the winner
of this week's Maxi Challenge.

1120
00:46:13,265 --> 00:46:14,532
[cheers and applause]

1121
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:18,402
You've won a $2.500 gift card

1122
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:23,374

[A'keria] Baby, listen,
I feel like Tony the Tiger.

1125
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,180
I feel great!

1126
00:46:29,181 --> 00:46:32,216
[RuPaul] A'Keria,
you picked a kickass team.

1127
00:46:32,217 --> 00:46:33,317
Thank you.

1128
00:46:33,318 --> 00:46:35,686
And that includes
the handicapped hooker.

1129

1132
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:45,296
So, Yvie, what happened?
What'd you do?

1133
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:47,665
My heel slipped out
from under me a little bit,

1134
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:48,799
and I rolled it.

1135
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,134
-Are you okay?
-I'm gonna be fine.

1136
00:46:50,135 --> 00:46:53,204
I want to take it easy
until the next challenge,

1137
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:55,740
and then get ready, bitches,
because she's a fast healer.

1138
00:46:55,741 --> 00:46:59,009
And for crying out loud,
no kick fucking.

1139
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:01,345
[all laugh]

1140
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:04,315
All right, Team A'Keria,
you may leave the stage.

1141
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:05,649
Thank you.

1142
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:11,622
Team Plastique,
I'm sorry, my dears,

1143
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:14,525
but you're all up
for elimination.

1144
00:47:14,526 --> 00:47:16,727
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1145
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:19,764
starting with Plastique Tiara.

1146
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:23,534
Your look tonight is just
really well put together.

1147
00:47:23,535 --> 00:47:26,537
The accents, the wings,
it all works for me.

1148
00:47:26,538 --> 00:47:28,773
[Michelle] You,
in particular, Plastique,

1149
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:30,040
tonight, I felt more from you,

1150
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,976
so I'm very happy.

1151
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:34,145
But I am going to ask for more,

1152
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:35,246
'cause you know
I'm a greedy-ass bottom.

1153
00:47:35,247 --> 00:47:36,313
[laughs]

1154
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:37,915
[Travis] I just think
you could just

1155
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:40,217
bring up the volume
in your performance.

1156
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:41,318
I felt like
some of the other queens

1157
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:42,653
have a bigger personality,

1158
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,888
and I just think
you need to like

1159
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:45,689
turn up that knob
as much as possible.

1160
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,391
[Michelle]
Keep going where you're going

1161
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:49,126
and push yourself
to get there quicker,

1162
00:47:49,127 --> 00:47:51,729
because tick tock,
you don't stop.

1163
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,297
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

1164
00:47:53,298 --> 00:47:54,665
[Michelle]
Tonight on the runway,

1165
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,134
I think you look really fun.

1166
00:47:57,135 --> 00:47:59,837
I'm not always a fan
of something covering the face,

1167
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,039
but it's see-through enough
that we can see your expression.

1168
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,109
[Adam] Performance-wise,
you still need to take it up.

1169
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,944
[Travis]
Yesterday, I felt like

1170
00:48:06,945 --> 00:48:09,747
you had some of the most tools
in your box

1171
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:11,382
compared to
the rest of your team.

1172
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:15,152
Today, I felt that you were
just slightly unmemorable.

1173
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:16,554
You're an amazing dancer.

1174
00:48:16,555 --> 00:48:17,988
I think you just need
to embody all of that

1175
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:18,923
and deliver it forward.

1176
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:23,627
Hearing that from you
kind of means the world to me,

1177
00:48:23,628 --> 00:48:27,064
because a couple weeks back...
[laughs]

1178
00:48:27,065 --> 00:48:30,267
I had a situation
with another choreographer

1179
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:31,969
that really just tore me down.

1180
00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:34,471
Whew.

1181
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:35,506
[Mirai] You know,
you're competing

1182
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:37,308
against big personalities,

1183
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:40,311
and so, in future challenges,
instead of looking to the past

1184
00:48:40,312 --> 00:48:43,848
and thinking on the negative,
just be you.

1185
00:48:43,849 --> 00:48:47,651
[RuPaul] Up next, Vanjie.

1186
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:49,587
Your energy in rehearsal
was infectious.

1187
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:51,422
It definitely portrayed
onto the stage

1188
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:52,790
in the main challenge.

1189
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,292
You slayed
the performance 100%.

1190
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:56,994
Tonight on the runway,

1191
00:48:56,995 --> 00:48:59,063
it's sort of like
Drag Race 101,

1192
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:02,132
where you shouldn't just
wear a leotard and tights.

1193
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:03,500
Do you know
what I'm going to say?

1194
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:04,969
I know. Sorry.

1195
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,537
[Michelle]
It's either a leotard

1196
00:49:06,538 --> 00:49:08,572
or a corset and a panty
and some kind of pasty.

1197
00:49:08,573 --> 00:49:10,007
-Right.
-And then glitter on the chest.

1198
00:49:10,008 --> 00:49:11,108
I know what
you're going to be wearing

1199
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:12,443
when you come around the corner.

1200
00:49:12,444 --> 00:49:13,844
I shouldn't be doing that,

1201
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:15,579
and I'm getting bored.

1202
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,282
[Mirai] So I get it.

1203
00:49:18,283 --> 00:49:19,817
Like maybe put a dress on.

1204
00:49:19,818 --> 00:49:22,319
But tonight, like,
I like the way you look.

1205
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,754
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

1206
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:26,757
[RuPaul] All right,
up next, Nina West.

1207
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,692
Even if you aren't
the best dancer up there,

1208
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:30,394
I didn't really give a shit.

1209
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:33,063
You were selling
every single moment.

1210
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:35,165
[Michelle] I could not take
my eyes off of you.

1211
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,800
You were enigmatic.

1212
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:38,469
[RuPaul] What did you call her?

1213
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,405
Sorry. I'm going to help you
with something now.

1214
00:49:41,406 --> 00:49:43,240
-You're a big girl.
-I am.

1215
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:45,643
-And you have big shoulders.
-I do.

1216
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:47,611
-And a big kind of chest.
-Yeah.

1217
00:49:47,612 --> 00:49:50,714
I think you need to focus more
padding on the bottom half

1218
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:53,083
to balance out the top half.

1219
00:49:53,084 --> 00:49:57,054
It's just going to make
a more pleasing figure.

1220
00:49:57,055 --> 00:49:58,956
Okay, absolutely.
I totally see that.

1221
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,125
Michelle is right. Maybe you
could put your tits on your ass.

1222
00:50:01,126 --> 00:50:02,726
[all laugh]

1223
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:06,397
[RuPaul]
All right. Scarlet Envy.

1224
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:09,333
You were actually the one
that I really lost.

1225
00:50:09,334 --> 00:50:12,569
You were like gone for me,
and I don't know why.

1226
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:13,971
I know what you can do
in a performance.

1227
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,773
I've directed you.

1228
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:17,408
Were you insecure
about the dancing?

1229
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:18,909
-Very.
-There we go.

1230
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,477
[Travis] Yesterday I felt like,
you know,

1231
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:22,379
it was hard for both of us.

1232
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:24,848
However, today,
you were the most improved.

1233
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:27,918
Were you the weakest at
retaining the choreography

1234
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:29,119
and the steps? Yes.

1235
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,288
Were you the weakest
at performance? No.

1236
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:33,524
[Michelle] And tonight
on the runway you look pretty,

1237
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:36,593
but it kind of
is not right for me.

1238
00:50:36,594 --> 00:50:37,728
Think grand, baby.

1239
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:40,164
[Adam] The outfit
is a little bit basic.

1240
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,800
The earrings
going into the necklace,

1241
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:44,802
that one is gold and one is--

1242
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:45,803
-There you go.
-Take it off.

1243
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:47,071
-Gorgeous.
-Already better.

1244
00:50:47,072 --> 00:50:48,806
It's already much better.

1245
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:50,975
It was just like
very hard for me this week.

1246
00:50:50,976 --> 00:50:54,945
I feel like I've been
so incredibly confident

1247
00:50:54,946 --> 00:50:56,747
through this process thus far,

1248
00:50:56,748 --> 00:51:00,417
I think maybe it almost gets on
my sisters' nerves occasionally.

1249
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:02,920
And it just vanished.

1250
00:51:06,323 --> 00:51:08,359
[RuPaul] Thank you, Scarlet.

1251
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,095
Ladies, I have a final question.

1252
00:51:11,096 --> 00:51:12,763
Who should go home tonight...

1253
00:51:15,065 --> 00:51:17,368
And why?

1254
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:19,903
Starting with Plastique Tiara.

1255
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:28,112
Just based on the critiques,
my sister Scarlet Envy.

1256
00:51:28,113 --> 00:51:29,513
All right. Ra'Jah.

1257
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:31,181
If it were my choice,
I would send Scarlet.

1258
00:51:31,182 --> 00:51:34,018
A lot of the times,
when I was losing my way--

1259
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,253
well, well, I won't blame her

1260
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:39,590
for some of the mistakes
that I made, but Scarlet.

1261
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:41,759
[Vanjie] I would have
to also say Scarlet,

1262
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,994
just based on
what has happened.

1263
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:45,195
Nina West.

1264
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:49,433
I would also say Scarlet.

1265
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:51,468
I will say this, though.

1266
00:51:51,469 --> 00:51:53,537
Nobody has worked harder,

1267
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:56,507
so I think
that should be noted.

1268
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:58,409
Scarlet, who should go home
tonight?

1269
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,314
I can't say any of them.

1270
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:08,919
But I'm not going to say me.

1271
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,555
[RuPaul] So who should go home?

1272
00:52:11,556 --> 00:52:15,059
I guess Ra'Jah's
been in the bottom

1273
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,062
a lot.

1274
00:52:18,063 --> 00:52:19,663
Well, thank you, ladies,
for your honesty,

1275
00:52:19,664 --> 00:52:20,931
and for your hard work.

1276
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:23,634
While you untuck backstage,

1277
00:52:23,635 --> 00:52:25,736
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1278
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:29,540
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

1279
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:30,774
what do you think?

1280
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:34,311
Let's start
with Plastique Tiara.

1281
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:37,481
Tonight on the runway, she
looks like an anime character.

1282
00:52:37,482 --> 00:52:39,016
She's gorgeous.

1283
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,684
[Michelle] I think
she has spent all this time

1284
00:52:40,685 --> 00:52:42,453
perfecting what's on the outside

1285
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:44,788
that she's forgetting
about what's on the inside.

1286
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:46,290
I still need more,

1287
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:48,892
or else she's just going to be
that pretty girl over there.

1288
00:52:48,893 --> 00:52:50,894
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

1289
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:53,697
In the performance,
I kept losing her.

1290
00:52:53,698 --> 00:52:55,399
[Michelle] When you're with
four other girls,

1291
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,135
you can't get lost in the mix.
You just can't.

1292
00:52:58,136 --> 00:53:00,370
It's do or die here
on RuPaul's Drag Race.

1293
00:53:00,371 --> 00:53:02,739
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1294
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,309
Listen, on the opposite end of
the spectrum, very memorable.

1295
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:08,912
[Adam] But tonight on
the runway was a total miss.

1296
00:53:08,913 --> 00:53:11,381
[RuPaul] Nina West,
our Viking queen.

1297
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:12,850
You can't win a challenge

1298
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:16,220
if you bring a look like that
to RuPaul's Drag Race.

1299
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:17,921
It wasn't just something
you can buy off the rack.

1300
00:53:17,922 --> 00:53:19,456
Are you sure?

1301
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:20,791
Those breasts
were the size of mine,

1302
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:22,459
which are not buyable
off the rack.

1303
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,694
You have to go to a doctor.

1304
00:53:23,695 --> 00:53:25,562
[all laugh]

1305
00:53:25,563 --> 00:53:28,532
But the performance tonight,
I'm a huge Nina fan.

1306
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:30,200
[RuPaul] Scarlet Envy.

1307
00:53:30,201 --> 00:53:32,736
Tonight on the runway,
her paint was pretty,

1308
00:53:32,737 --> 00:53:35,005
her hair was pretty,
it just wasn't enough.

1309
00:53:35,006 --> 00:53:36,273
It needed to be bigger.

1310
00:53:36,274 --> 00:53:37,608
She gave us butterfly clips.

1311
00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:39,176
Butterflies
are a very tender subject

1312
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:40,177
here at RuPaul's Drag Race.

1313
00:53:40,178 --> 00:53:42,713
[all laugh]

1314
00:53:42,714 --> 00:53:43,881
She was definitely
the hardest person

1315
00:53:43,882 --> 00:53:45,349
I've ever worked with
in my career.

1316
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:46,350
-What?
-You're kidding. Really?

1317
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,252
To like to get
to do steps. Yes.

1318
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:49,419
[RuPaul] Because
there's the counting?

1319
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:50,821
[Travis]
It's just the counting.

1320
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:52,689
It was just a really hard
disconnect from brain to foot.

1321
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:55,192
In her defense, your left foot
and your right foot,

1322
00:53:55,193 --> 00:53:56,493
they look very similar.

1323
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,462
-They're very similar.
-Yeah.

1324
00:53:58,463 --> 00:53:59,830
And they're
right next to each other.

1325
00:53:59,831 --> 00:54:01,198
-[Michelle] Yes.
-[Adam] I know. I know.

1326
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:02,566
[Travis] It must be really hard
to stand on stage

1327
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:04,568
and have all of your sisters
say your name to go home.

1328
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:06,370
I don't know
what that feels like.

1329
00:54:06,371 --> 00:54:07,738
Ru, who do you think
should go home?

1330
00:54:07,739 --> 00:54:09,773
-Travis Wall!
-[laughs]

1331
00:54:09,774 --> 00:54:13,277
All right, silence.
I've made my decision.

1332
00:54:13,278 --> 00:54:16,813
Bring back my golden girls.

1333
00:54:16,814 --> 00:54:18,382
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

1334
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:20,217
I've made some decisions.

1335
00:54:23,654 --> 00:54:27,124
Plastique Tiara,
you found your wings.

1336
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:29,326
Now take me higher.

1337
00:54:29,327 --> 00:54:31,595
You're safe.

1338
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:33,931
You may join the other girls.

1339
00:54:35,065 --> 00:54:38,101
Scarlet Envy, you are beautiful,

1340
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:43,073
but tonight your performance
didn't score with the judges.

1341
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:46,043
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1342
00:54:49,179 --> 00:54:54,084
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo,
you're a funny bunny,

1343
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:57,054
but stop relying
on that bodysuit.

1344
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:00,190
-You're safe.
-Thank you.

1345
00:55:03,727 --> 00:55:08,632
Ra'Jah O'Hara, tonight
you got lost in the crowd.

1346
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:12,836
Nina West,
we have one word for you.

1347
00:55:12,837 --> 00:55:14,871
Proportionizing.

1348
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,674
Nina West...

1349
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:22,479
You are safe.

1350
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,648
Thank you very much.

1351
00:55:29,987 --> 00:55:33,890
Ra'Jah, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1352
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:36,426
[Ra'Jah] Here we go again.

1353
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:37,828
I'm so sick
of being in the bottom.

1354
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:42,165
[RuPaul] Two queens
stand before me.

1355
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:45,936
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1356
00:55:45,937 --> 00:55:49,940
and save yourself
from elimination.

1357
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:54,711
The time has come...
[thunder]

1358
00:55:54,712 --> 00:55:56,847
for you to lip sync...

1359
00:55:56,848 --> 00:55:59,816
[echoing] for your life!

1360
00:56:02,219 --> 00:56:05,155
[Scarlet] I'm gonna give this
everything I have.

1361
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:06,690
I'm not ready to go home.

1362
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:09,226
Good luck...

1363
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:12,596
and don't fuck it up.
