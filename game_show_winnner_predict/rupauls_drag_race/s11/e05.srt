if that's how I have to fight

you need to transform yourself
into a living doll

176
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:00,313
that can be my doll's BFF.

177
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:03,616
Ready, set...

178
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:04,617
Oh, wait a minute.

179
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,054
Guess who I found

180
00:07:08,055 --> 00:07:10,757
hiding behind the wig heads
in my dressing room?

181
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:18,064
Hello, hello, hello.

182
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:22,068
It's our very own backwoods
Barbie, Trixie Mattel.

183
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,470
[cheers and laughter]

184
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:24,738
[Shuga] Girl, Trixie is here.

185
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:27,173
She is the winner
of All Stars 3.

186
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:29,008
I love this queen.

187
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,745
-Hi, Trixie.
-Hi, RuPaul and RuPaul.

188
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:33,380
[all laugh]

189
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,416
What's the secret
to being a best friend?

190
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,118
Well, you wanna be nice
to everybody

191
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,587
because you never know when it's
gonna come down to a jury vote.

192
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:42,555
[all laugh]

193
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:45,125
[RuPaul] All right, ladies,
you've got 20 minutes

194
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,260
to get all dolled up.

195
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:49,562
And I'll meet you
on the green screen.

196
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:52,232
Ready, set, go.

197
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:56,269
[Trixie] Some of that
is actually mine,

198
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,404
but I guess you can have it.

199
00:07:57,405 --> 00:07:59,272
Get off my ass, you bitch.

200
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:00,673
[Brooke Lynn] It's like it's
a fucking sample sale

201
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,208
at Christian Louboutin

202
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:04,310
and everyone's
just like aah, aah.

203
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:07,347
[Trixie] I'm not hearing
any makeup brushes.

204
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:09,649
I should hear your skin
coming off your face.

205
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,484
[all laugh]
What's your name?

206
00:08:11,485 --> 00:08:13,353
-I'm Scarlet.
-I already forgot.

207
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,155
[all laugh]
What are you doing?

208
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:17,056
I'm a penitentiary doll.

209
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:20,126
I actually killed a couple of
girls to be Ru's best friend.

210
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:21,027
Are you sure
you're not Michelle?

211
00:08:21,028 --> 00:08:23,396
[all laugh]

212
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:25,131
So I have to ask.

213
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,966
What makes you think RuPaul's
best friend is a crash dummy?

214
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,435
[laughs]

215
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:29,536
Seeing all the people
she's crowned.

216
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:31,504
[all laugh]

217
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:33,039
So funny.

218
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,608
Welcome to
the Valley of the Dolls.

219
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:38,478
First up, Plastique Tiara.

220
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,447
[Trixie] Meet Plastique.

221
00:08:40,448 --> 00:08:44,084
She's not just a supermodel,
she's also a manicurist.

222
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:45,985
If you give her
too much wig water,

223
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:47,587
she develops back rolls.

224
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:49,055
Back rolls?

225
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,324
Spring rolls?
[RuPaul laughs]

226
00:08:51,325 --> 00:08:55,628
Meet Gloria Freebush,
RuPaul's feminist bestie.

227
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:58,565
When you pull her string,
her pussy grabs back.

228
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,200
[Trixie laughs]

229
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:05,038
Meet Laurena Maria Prudencia
Lisa de la Boom Badaboom.

230
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:07,307
Her friends call her Flaquita.

231
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:09,008
[Trixie] The hair
and that animal print

232
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:10,710
is vaguely familiar.

233
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,278
Have you been to Cameroon?

234
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,613
[RuPaul laughs]

235
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,216
[RuPaul] Meet Sticky
Finger Silky.

236
00:09:16,217 --> 00:09:19,719
A lot of dolls drive
fancy pink sports cars,

237
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,021
but she drives
a doughnut truck.

238
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:24,224
Her box is stuffed
with all kinds

239
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:26,159
of fun-to-play-with
accessories,

240
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,229
like bootleg CDs and chips.

241
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,265
Dips not included.

242
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:34,100
Uranium Yvie.

243
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,301
Kids love to play with her

244
00:09:35,302 --> 00:09:38,238
because they can shave
her periodic table

245
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:40,039
and watch the hair grow back.

246
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,608
[Trixie laughs]

247
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,109
[Trixie] Meet Awesome Ariel.

248
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,445
She's full of surprises.

249
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:48,248
When you pull her string,
she swallows.

250
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:50,083
Awesome Ariel
can't move her face,

251
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,118
but she can bend her neck,
her back,

252
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,988
from her pussy to her crack.

253
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:57,457
[RuPaul] Meet Stupid Scarlet.

254
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,325
She lives
in a state of judgment,

255
00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:00,660
because she loves to hate.

256
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:03,329
[Trixie]
Cheap wig and a pink dress.

257
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,732
A woman after my own heart.
[RuPaul laughs]

258
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:08,535
[Trixie] Meet
Starr-Keisha Booty La'RaJah.

259
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,436
She might have smaller feet
than RuPaul,

260
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:12,705
but her badonkadonk
is enormous.

261
00:10:12,706 --> 00:10:14,507
Her box is stuffed

262
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:16,276
with all kinds of
fun-to-play-with accessories,

263
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:18,611
like an extra-large cup
of drank.

264
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:20,346
[RuPaul laughs]

265
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:22,649
A lot of dolls drive
fancy pink sports cars,

266
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,084
but she drives a bus.

267
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:29,022
She's not just a doll,
she's a bad bitch.

268
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,257
Meet Bachelorette Brandy.

269
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,027
Her favorite hobbies
are cocktails,

270
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:35,528
peeing behind dumpsters,

271
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,797
and telling everyone
she's getting married.

272
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:38,798
I know that girl.

273
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,500
She's always a hit at parties,

274
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,702
because her hips
are double jointed.

275
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:44,070
Oh, Katya's here.

276
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:45,338
[RuPaul laughs]

277
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:47,440
[RuPaul] Meet Miss Vangie.

278
00:10:47,441 --> 00:10:49,542
Trixie, I'm coming
for your gig, girl.

279
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:51,311
I do have a broken suitcase.

280
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:54,147
[RuPaul] Vanessa Mateo
is attending night school

281
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:56,316
at the University of Hookin'

282
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:58,551
to get her degree
in stripperology.

283
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:00,753
Whoo. Oh.

284
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:04,224
[laughs]

285
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:05,491
Did y'all get it?
[RuPaul laughs]

286
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,293
[RuPaul] She's not just a doll,

287
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,662
she's a Miss Vanjie.

288
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:11,397
[Trixie] Meet A'Keria.

289
00:11:11,398 --> 00:11:14,067
Her friends call her
inmate 304.

290
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,402
When you pull her string,

291
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:19,138
she pulls a blade
from under her wig.

292
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,674
You know, in prison
she's armed and dangerous.

293
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:24,277
-Well, one-armed.
-One-armed and dangerous.

294
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:26,646
[RuPaul laughs]

295
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:28,248
[RuPaul] Nice work, dolls.

296
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,784
But one of you really
melted my plastic heart.

297
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:33,720
[all laugh]

298
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:37,590
The winner of today's
Mini Challenge is...

299
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:39,425
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

300
00:11:39,426 --> 00:11:42,028
[cheers and applause]

301
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,796
Yes!

302
00:11:43,797 --> 00:11:46,499
You've won
a $1.000 gift card

303
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,202
from Coolhaus Ice Cream.

304
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,037
-I'll take it.
-Ooh.

305
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:53,172
Trixie, thank you
for playing today.

306
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:55,642
Do you have any parting words
for my girls?

307
00:11:55,643 --> 00:11:58,678
Winning isn't everything,
but it's super fucking awesome.

308
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,113
[all laugh]

309
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:02,682
-Byeee!
-Byeee.

310
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:05,318
The helicopters are circling.
I gotta go.

311
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,686
[all laugh]

312
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:09,422
Ladies, you know what
a drag queen calls Halloween?

313
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:10,490
What?

314
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:11,557
Amateur night.

315
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,026
[all laugh]

316
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:14,494
[RuPaul] That's right.

317
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:18,031
It is time for you to show
the children how it's done.

318
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:22,602
For this week's Maxi Challenge,
baby, we are throwing us a ball.

319
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:25,672
[cheers and applause]

320
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:28,307
But not just
any old ball, darling.

321
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:33,012
We are throwing
a Monster Ball.

322
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,647
[cheering]

323
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,716


324
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:39,252
Now, you need to scare up
three lurks.

325
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:42,689
First lurk,
Trampy Trick or Treater.

326
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,457
You know, like, Naughty Nurse

327
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,161
or Dirty Doctor
or Sexy Soccer Mom.

328
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:49,195
[all laugh]

329
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:52,231
Second look, Witch, Please.

330
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:56,302
You know, like broomsticks,
bubbling cauldrons

331
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:57,704
and things of that nature.

332
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,972
And for your third lurk,

333
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,375
you need to design and create

334
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:06,312
a look that serves
both beauty and beast.

335
00:13:06,313 --> 00:13:08,981
[all laugh]

336
00:13:08,982 --> 00:13:11,751
Category is MILF Eleganza,

337
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:16,489
as in Monsters I'd
Like to Freak.

338
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,257
[cheers and applause]
Age!

339
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:22,261
For your MILF looks,
you can use these items here,

340
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:27,100
more materials
from the FandS Fabrics wall.

341
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:30,470
So good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

342
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:32,438
All right?

343
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:34,040
[all] All right.

344
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:35,408
[applause]

345
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,749
[Yvie] Our challenge today
is the Monster's Ball.

346
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,152
Because it's a ball, you have
to serve in three categories.

347
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,588
There's Trampy Trick
or Treater realness,

348
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:52,358
Witch Please!,
and Monster I'd Like to Freak.

349
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:55,361
What if I made the dress
out of this red pleather,

350
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,296
because I got enough
to make a whole--a full dress.

351
00:13:57,297 --> 00:13:59,432
Right. What you wanna do?

352
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,633
I don't know.
I'm a devil.

353
00:14:00,634 --> 00:14:02,368
What's a little devil wear,
honey?

354
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,669
Prada.

355
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,805
[all laugh]

356
00:14:07,573 --> 00:14:09,675
And see, like, bitch,
I can cut this fur off

357
00:14:09,676 --> 00:14:10,977
and put red on them.

358
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:13,079
That looks like werewolf, no?

359
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,614
-That's giving werewolf.
-Yeah.

360
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,649
[Silky] In this competition,
there are cliques.

361
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,552
I am closest to the dream girls,

362
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:24,490
and the dream girls consist
of me, A'Keria, and Miss Vanjie.

363
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:26,159
You're complicating it
more than what it--

364
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,193
Yeah, you're making it hard.

365
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:28,528
You're making it
real complicated.

366
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:31,130
Do something that's gonna
make you look fierce.

367
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,199
The dream girls are gonna
be the top three. Duh.

368
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm gonna do
this big mermaid bottom,

369
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,668
'cause ain't nobody
gonna do that.

370
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,304
Okay, bitch, I think I got it.

371
00:14:38,305 --> 00:14:41,207
[Yvie] With Silky,
the judges have been

372
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:45,011
sort of lenient
on her style issues

373
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:46,646
because of her personality.

374
00:14:46,647 --> 00:14:48,714
Which like isn't a bad thing,
but I don't think she gets

375
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,617
she can't ride her
personality train to the end,

376
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:55,154
especially in challenges
where she's not comfortable.

377
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:56,355
Bitch.

378
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:57,557
I have to remake this.

379
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,027
I'm not too fond of Halloween.

380
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:02,595
I'm not a spooky bitch.

381
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:06,399
If you want to see me in a ball,
honey, just go for realness.

382
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,036
So in this challenge,
I want to emphasize

383
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:12,638
more on the freak part,
not really a monster.

384
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,575
I just want to show that
there's more than spook to me,

385
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:18,444
unlike some of the other ho's
in this competition.

386
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:21,180
You watching, so you know
who the ho's are.

387
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,648
I may be in the bottom
for this round,

388
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:24,116
but I don't give a fuck.

389
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:25,518
If I got to lip sync,
bitch, I got to lip sync.

390
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,119
I'm ready.

391
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,754
[Shuga] You look always ready
to lip sync, girl.

392
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:30,056
That's the only one I know

393
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:32,258
always want to lip sync.

394
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,526
I'm gonna let y'all
have it, honey.

395
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:35,228
Careful what you wish for, girl.

396
00:15:38,531 --> 00:15:40,266
How you doin' boo.

397
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,567
Good.

398
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:42,568
[Brooke Lynn] What kind of
monster are you?

399
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:44,070
I drew it out here.

400
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:45,471
[Brooke Lynn] Me and Vanjie,

401
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:48,074
it's nice having
this thing happen.

402
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:50,209
But this is work.
We're here for a competition.

403
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,011
It's not personal,
it's drag.

404
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,379
But I'm gonna do it longer.

405
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,780
I was gonna do it short,
but I'm doing it longer.

406
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,250
-Cute.
-I want to make it crystal clear

407
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:59,752
that ain't no boy gonna
come between me and the crown.

408
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm focused.

409
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,426
Hey, cysts.

410
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,228
-Hi.
-Hey, Ru.

411
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,097
How are
my little monsters doing?

412
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:12,131
Killer.

413
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,166
[all laugh]

414
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:16,168
Nina West.

415
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,403
Hi, Mr. Charles.

416
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:18,638
Do you have
any favorite monsters?

417
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,573
Bride of Frankenstein.

418
00:16:20,574 --> 00:16:22,375
Elsa Lanchester.

419
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:24,644
[Nina] Elegant, gorgeous,
and still scary.

420
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:26,445
-And iconic. Yeah.
-Yeah.

421
00:16:26,446 --> 00:16:28,514
You know, she did an episode
of Murder She Wrote.

422
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,049
Wait a minute. What episode
are you talking about?

423
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,384
Was that her? No, I'm sorry.
I'm thinking...

424
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:33,552
Baby, you do not want to test

425
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,688
my Murder She Sat Down
and Wrote knowledge of that,

426
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:37,323
because she was never on there.

427
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:38,457
No, she wasn't,
because I confused--

428
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,392
-But you know who was.
-Lillian Munster.

429
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:41,694
-I confused her.
-Oh, yeah, Yvonne De Carlo.

430
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:44,530
She played the cook on
the Jessica Behind Bars episode.

431
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,532
Yeah, yeah, when she goes in and
talks to the women in prison.

432
00:16:46,533 --> 00:16:48,367
-Yes.
-I love that show.

433
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:49,435
Is that what you're going to do,
Bride of Frankenstein?

434
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,537
No, no, I'm going
more corpse bride,

435
00:16:51,538 --> 00:16:54,073
'cause she's
a little decomposing.

436
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:55,775
I'm campy, I'm theatrical,

437
00:16:55,776 --> 00:16:59,011
and I really want to make sure
that that's part of this look.

438
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:00,546
But still sexy.

439
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:02,415
'Cause the idea is that we want
to fornicate with her.

440
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,183
But there's some cobwebs
you have to clear away, but...

441
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,384
-Oh.
-You want to dive right in.

442
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:06,385
Story of my life.

443
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,386
[laughs]

444
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,055
Now, Nina,
if I remember correctly,

445
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:10,189
you had an issue
with the design challenge.

446
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,357
I did, I did.

447
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,392
How are you going
to overcome that here?

448
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:15,194
I'm going to tone down
all of the voices

449
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,596
that make me want to go bigger,

450
00:17:16,597 --> 00:17:18,664
and focus on
delivering something

451
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:20,299
that is within my ability.

452
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,535
Oh, boy.
How many voices are in there?

453
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,403
Girl, plenty.

454
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:25,571
-Uh-huh.
-Plenty.

455
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,174
Scares. All right,
I'll see you out there.

456
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:29,075
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thanks, Nina.

457
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:33,279
-Hi, Shuga Cain.
-Hi, Mama Ru.

458
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,215
So now, have you won
any challenges?

459
00:17:36,216 --> 00:17:37,383
-I have not.
-Why is that?

460
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:39,752
Maybe I'm not giving
as much as I should.

461
00:17:39,753 --> 00:17:41,721
So it's allowed me to kind of

462
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:43,522
really think about
what I'm doing here,

463
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:44,590
and look at the girls
who are winning stuff.

464
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:45,625
Like, where is the difference?

465
00:17:45,626 --> 00:17:47,693
So there's definitely a fire.

466
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,595
Now, your history with drag

467
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:51,130
is that you had been
in the corporate world.

468
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:52,465
Yeah.

469
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:54,600
You quit all that
to do drag full time.

470
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:57,570
Had you done drag before
you were in the corporate world?

471
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,171
No. I mean,
I dabbled a little bit,

472
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:00,940
and I just kind of--
I got the bug,

473
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:03,943
and, you know, after trying to
pursue art for so many years,

474
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:06,479
I finally was like
the cycle has to change.

475
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,449
I can't be in a dead-end job
and just, you know,

476
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,018
wishing I was doing
something that I love.

477
00:18:12,019 --> 00:18:13,252
And I'd saved some money,

478
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:14,286
so I was like,
I'm just going to do it.

479
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:15,955
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And see what happens.

480
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,323
I was comfortable.

481
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:18,991
I had that stable job
making six figures,

482
00:18:18,992 --> 00:18:20,960
and to just risk it all,

483
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,128
there's no turning back for me.

484
00:18:22,129 --> 00:18:23,396
Like everything is on the line.

485
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:26,332
Well, hello,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

486
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,067
Hi, Ru.

487
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:30,069
Where does your design aesthetic
come from?

488
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,571
All over. I just know
what looks good on my body,

489
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,640
and I know what I like to wear,
so I always start there.

490
00:18:34,641 --> 00:18:36,075
When did you find that out?

491
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:38,711
Probably a couple years ago.

492
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:40,479
-Just a couple years ago?
-Yeah.

493
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,149
I only started sewing probably
about a year and a half ago.

494
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,384
Yeah. And so
when I say sexy monster,

495
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,019
what's the first thing
that comes to mind?

496
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,321
I actually don't watch
a lot of scary movies,

497
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:51,223
so the first thing
that came to my mind

498
00:18:51,224 --> 00:18:52,425
was I want to be
a sexy pageant queen.

499
00:18:55,461 --> 00:18:58,564
But I want to be a
first runner up who never wins.

500
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:00,533
So she scalps
all the other winners

501
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:01,967
and makes like her own crown
out of their heads.

502
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:06,105
Okay.

503
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:08,174
Okay.

504
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:11,377
Giving that kind of like
very glassy RuPaul look.

505
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:14,547
So, you know,
that's an interesting choice.

506
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:16,248
[Brooke Lynn] It's one of those
things

507
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:18,250
where you think something's
a really good idea,

508
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:20,052
and then you start
verbalizing it to somebody,

509
00:19:20,053 --> 00:19:21,487
and you see their reaction.

510
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,622
Okay, I need to do
something else.

511
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:29,195
-Hi, Plastique.
-Hi, Ru.

512
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:31,063
Now, you're a sewing bitch,
aren't you?

513
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:32,465
You could say that.

514
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,433
I really wanted to win
the first challenge.

515
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,635
However, Brooke Lynn,
she took the cake.

516
00:19:36,636 --> 00:19:41,574
But I'm gonna make
this challenge my bitch, so...

517
00:19:41,575 --> 00:19:44,510
Okay. So when I say sexy
monster, what comes to mind?

518
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,279
Like dark angel,
like, this dark lady.

519
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,981
It's past the point of zombie.

520
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:51,517
Now she's just a beautiful
spirit, just flowing around.

521
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:53,018
But still looking for the D.

522
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:54,687
Always and forever.

523
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:56,255
[RuPaul] Okay, all right.

524
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:58,090
But you know,
you're a pretty queen.

525
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,091
Thank you.

526
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:01,060
Can you do monster drag?

527
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:03,329
Um, I haven't had
the opportunity

528
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,331
to show y'all
that side of me yet,

529
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:06,332
so I'm very excited.

530
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:07,600
Yeah.

531
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,301
[Silky] I ain't buying it,
honey.

532
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:10,669
I just don't buy it.

533
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,105
The bitch gonna give you pretty
all day, every day,

534
00:20:13,106 --> 00:20:15,741
in three fucking corsets.

535
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,710
All right.
Can't wait to see what you do.

536
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:18,778
Thank you.

537
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,082
-Yvie Oddly.
-Hi, Ru.

538
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,484
So, now, Yvie Oddly,
where does that come from?

539
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:28,354
I had some other boring
who-gives-a-shit drag name,

540
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:31,690
but people would say like
she just is so strange on stage.

541
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:34,026
So I named myself Yvie Oddly,

542
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:36,395
since I'm even odder
than everyone else, I guess.

543
00:20:36,396 --> 00:20:39,331
[RuPaul] How you gonna snatch
the trophy on this challenge?

544
00:20:39,332 --> 00:20:41,400
I'm gonna take a fashion element

545
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,702
and combine it
with my unique perspective.

546
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:46,739
I just wanna show that
I can also pull off some glam.

547
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,440
-Uh-huh.
-[laughs]

548
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,675
Is that what you're going to do
in this challenge?

549
00:20:49,676 --> 00:20:51,710
I mean, I'm actually going
to be a voodoo doll, so...

550
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,145
Okay.

551
00:20:53,146 --> 00:20:54,480
She's going to be glamorous,

552
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:57,416
but I still want to give
a little bit of a nod to my odd.

553
00:20:57,417 --> 00:20:59,351
Well, I can't wait
to see what you turn out.

554
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:01,353
[Yvie] The girls
have already made it clear

555
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:02,621
that they see me as a monster.

556
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:06,292
The judges have seen a lot
with my monster drag.

557
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,260
So I'm a little bit afraid

558
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:11,530
that if I come out
as entirely monster,

559
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,365
the judges are going
to read me for filth,

560
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,501
and I don't want to be
predictable.

561
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,707
I look across the room,
I see Ariel.

562
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,342
And what she's making

563
00:21:23,343 --> 00:21:26,278
looks like something from Party
City, Little Mermaid section.

564
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,780
I don't see no spook.

565
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:30,182
How you gonna
make that scary, girl?

566
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:34,353
And it has to be scary.

567
00:21:34,354 --> 00:21:36,522
Everyone's kind of like
I don't know if that's enough.

568
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:38,057
You need to make that
like monster.

569
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,226
But I still think that
I want to keep my mermaid

570
00:21:40,227 --> 00:21:42,728
a little bit more cutesy
so it's still true to me.

571
00:21:42,729 --> 00:21:44,296
I wish I had more
of that green tulle,

572
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:45,464
'cause I don't want it
to look like

573
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:47,032
I was like I got this
at Spirit Halloween.

574
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:50,569
So I just need to do something
to it, bitch.

575
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,770
[Plastique]
Yeah, you should.

576
00:21:51,771 --> 00:21:55,374
I'm telling you this
because I love you.

577
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,809
-I know.
-[Plastique] Ariel's my girl.

578
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,810
We've gotten really close.

579
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:00,546
So I'm very worried about her.

580
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:03,215
[Scarlet] Ariel lives
in a nineties

581
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:05,351
Nickelodeon kind of place.

582
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:08,520
I just don't know
if that's enough.

583
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:11,290
There's not
very much variety so far.

584
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,759
A similar wig,
a similar makeup.

585
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,327
I'm just not sure
she can pull this off.

586
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:24,670
What you making, ho?

587
00:22:24,671 --> 00:22:26,639
I'm doing, um...

588
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,274
I heard something about
first runner up or something.

589
00:22:33,045 --> 00:22:34,480
[A'Keria]
So now what you thinking?

590
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:36,515
I think I'm going to do
the snake wrapped around me.

591
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,220
[A'Keria] Monster it up?

592
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:42,655
You only got one snake?

593
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:44,023
[Brooke Lynn] Yeah.

594
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:46,692
I don't know
where this is leading to.

595
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,694
It's just a snake
wrapped around her head.

596
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:53,198
I don't... [sighs]

597
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:55,200
I'm definitely getting
in my head a little bit

598
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:56,368
because A, I have
a lot of pressure on me

599
00:22:56,369 --> 00:22:58,137
because I won
the last design challenge,

600
00:22:58,138 --> 00:23:00,239
and B, I know how to do sexy,

601
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,408
but I'm trying to figure out
how to make it monster.

602
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:03,442
Do you think
it's monster-y enough?

603
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,212
It's very glamour.

604
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,615
Brooke Lynn is the frontrunner
for this challenge,

605
00:23:09,616 --> 00:23:11,750
but I think she's starting
to feel the pressure.

606
00:23:11,751 --> 00:23:13,452
Hopefully we'll get her
into some trouble, honey.

607
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:14,753
This is gonna be cute

608
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:15,688
when you figure out,
like, what it's gonna be.

609
00:23:15,689 --> 00:23:16,955
[laughs]

610
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:20,726
Yes. Oh, my God.

611
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:23,629
I'm living already.

612
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,331
Some of these girls
are doing, you know,

613
00:23:25,332 --> 00:23:29,768
scary, spooky skeleton
glamour lady, you know.

614
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:33,005
And, like, you know,
just like know your history.

615
00:23:33,006 --> 00:23:35,708
Know what are iconic monsters.

616
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:38,677
So my MILF eleganza

617
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:40,746
is the Creature
of the Black Lagoon.

618
00:23:47,252 --> 00:23:50,189
I feel like this is actually
really terrifying, right?

619
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,024
[Shuga] Scarlet is definitely
feeling herself.

620
00:23:52,025 --> 00:23:55,060
She's walking up and down
this joint in her own world.

621
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:58,297
You can kind of see my face,
kind of not.

622
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:01,233
Creature of the Black Lagoon
is very this.

623
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,968
[A'Keria] You know how when
you go into a movie store

624
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:05,037
and they got the dollar bin?

625
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:06,605
So it's like the generic version
of the movie.

626
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,242
Straight to DVD.

627
00:24:10,243 --> 00:24:12,144
Bitch, you hot glue that
or did you sew it?

628
00:24:12,145 --> 00:24:13,312
I sewed it, girl.
Of course.

629
00:24:13,313 --> 00:24:15,447
[laughs]

630
00:24:15,448 --> 00:24:17,349
This is like
at least like six panels.

631
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,384
[all laugh]

632
00:24:18,385 --> 00:24:19,518
Girl, you love a good panel.

633
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,121
And the panel loves her, okay?

634
00:24:22,122 --> 00:24:23,622
I'm talking about the judges,
of course.

635
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:25,691
Girl, I think that was one time.

636
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:27,593
Ooh.

637
00:24:27,594 --> 00:24:28,660
[Scarlet] That's more than
they've loved some of us.

638
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,362
Ooh!

639
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,064
Girl.

640
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:33,766
Scarlet thinks
she is serving right now,

641
00:24:33,767 --> 00:24:36,568
but the only thing
she's serving is holes.

642
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,739
Booty holes. [laughs]

643
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,476
[Silky] That bitch,
she need a rewind.

644
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:45,644
Try again.

645
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:51,450
Happy Halloween!

646
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:53,252
Yes.

647
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:54,219
All right,
I need to finish shit.

648
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,588
[Nina] It's here, kids.
The Ball is here.

649
00:24:56,589 --> 00:24:57,623
Give me a kiss.

650
00:24:57,624 --> 00:24:59,525
Miss Branjie.

651
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:00,626
Ooh.

652
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:03,395
[laughs]

653
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:06,632
Are y'all excited?

654
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,033
Yes. This is going to be
so fun.

655
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:09,535
33 looks on the runway.

656
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:11,069
[Ariel]
That gags me.

657
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,204
This is a good opportunity

658
00:25:12,205 --> 00:25:13,705
to be able to turn out,
like, fun looks.

659
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,507
I love Halloween.

660
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:18,110
Like, I don't do, like,
spooky drag all the time,

661
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:19,978
so that's when I have like
an excuse to like force myself--

662
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,680
Really do it, yeah.

663
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:24,450
[Yvie] Technically speaking,
I'm halfway a Halloween queen.

664
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:26,118
Like the first time
I ever cross dressed at all--

665
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,653
Yeah.

666
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:30,155
Was Halloween, because my mom
dressed up as a pimp.

667
00:25:30,156 --> 00:25:31,690
[laughs]

668
00:25:31,691 --> 00:25:33,125
And then I was her dead hooker.

669
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:34,593
Okay, that's fabulous.

670
00:25:34,594 --> 00:25:37,262
I love that your mom
was the pimp.

671
00:25:37,263 --> 00:25:40,399
My grandma
was definitely not happy.

672
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,668
I don't like going out in drag
for Halloween.

673
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:46,004
I started my drag career
on Halloween.

674
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,539
It was my friend, you know,

675
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,574
we had dared each other
to actually get in drag.

676
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:49,675
And of course,
we was trying to see

677
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:51,109
who was going to be
the fishiest girl.

678
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,478
Who was the fishiest?

679
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,314
Girl, you know who
the fishiest was, bitch.

680
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:57,683
Probably because I only had on

681
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,551
like the littlest
amount of foundation.

682
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,053
You know we were Plastique.

683
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:03,555
Um...
[all laugh]

684
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,691
So you're saying Plastique's
still playing the drag?

685
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:07,593
-Girl.
-Ooh.

686
00:26:07,594 --> 00:26:09,394
[Ra'Jah] Well, you know she just
found her way into it, right?

687
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:11,296
[Plastique] These girls,

688
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:13,532
they're just thinking
I'm just a pretty queen.

689
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:15,334
But when I first
started doing drag,

690
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:19,571
I was doing spooky, dark,
very demon-like makeup.

691
00:26:19,572 --> 00:26:21,273
So I guess
we'll just have to see.

692
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:28,580
Let me go over here and see

Ooh, Ru, my dear, I would have

734
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:38,443

744
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,168
[A'Keria]
When a lot of girls think sexy,

745
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:05,270
they run to a nurse
or something like that.

746
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:07,372
I wanted to see
if I could make a dealer

747
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:10,609
who sits behind a poker table
look sexy.

748
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,679

and I brought the poker table.

My body looks like

This is the quintessential
Nina West look.

783
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,695
It has high camp.
It's also high drag.

784
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:38,296
[Ross] I couldn't really see
back there,

785
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:39,531

It feels amazing

815
00:31:32,485 --> 00:31:34,519
to use my dance training

816
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,221
I don't think there's ever
been a mummy on point

817
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:38,623

[Ariel] I'm the only punk rock
PVC Silent Hill nurse.

825
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,472
Each syringe represents

00:31:54,473 --> 00:31:56,041
I've got my goddamn
lips and cheeks done.

827
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,176
So as you can imagine,

You could prick me anytime.

I thought I was going to be
a paleontologist.

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,440
I wanted to hit on that
a little bit.

844
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:31,243
This is a children's
Halloween costume

845
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:33,044
that I've cut
the armholes out of

846
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:37,282
and then I've attached dinosaur
claws to my cute dino pumps.

847
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:40,285
This look is dino-mite.

848

This is only
for the grown and sexy,

858
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,178
so if you ain't grown and sexy,
don't join the line, honey.

859
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:09,080

Charlize Theron in
Snow White and the Huntsman.

869
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:36,074
I'm the witch that you
kind of want to be with her,

870
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:39,644
'cause you want a piece,
but you know she's deadly.

871
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:41,179
[Ross] She really went out
on a limb with that bird.

872
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,615
[RuPaul] It's nice
to see her branching out.

00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:50,588
that black is the new black.

877
00:33:50,589 --> 00:33:52,724
[all laugh]

878
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:54,659
[Vanjie] I know they're liking
this interpretation,

879
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,328
'cause I didn't do

880
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:58,363
the regular-degular
Party City style witch.

881
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:01,399
I'm taking it
to a high couture runway,

882
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,169
with a fascinator
for the subtleties.

883
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,038
This witch is rich, bitch.

884
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,540

[Plastique]
I'm Maleficent's Asian sister.

890
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:20,418
I'm cinched for the gods.

891
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:22,420
I'm giving them face for days.

00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:25,724

[Michelle] Somebody likes
to roll around in the hay.

Hay hay!

898
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,171
[Scarlet] My concept
is a Fire Island witch.

899
00:34:40,172 --> 00:34:43,441
She is beachy,
she's kind of swampy,

900
00:34:43,442 --> 00:34:46,411
and she's giving you
pants on the runway

901
00:34:46,412 --> 00:34:49,214
and feeling magical.

902
00:34:49,215 --> 00:34:51,116

[all laugh]

907
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,124
[Nina] My look is inspired

908
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:02,594
by a good old-fashioned
Salem witch,

909
00:35:02,595 --> 00:35:04,195
with flames
coming up the dress

910
00:35:04,196 --> 00:35:05,397
as if I'm being
burned at the stake.

911
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:08,199
I am serving old school witch.

912
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,468
Like literally.
From like 1510.

913
00:35:10,469 --> 00:35:12,170

Fuck, it looks good on me.

924
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,395
[Elvira] Why, it's the regular

00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:38,730
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

926
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,565
[Elvira] She's been framed!

927
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:43,168
[RuPaul] It kind of makes me
want a Bloody Mary.

928
00:35:43,169 --> 00:35:47,305
[Shuga] I am Bloody Mary,
urban legend, spooky queen.

929
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:49,340
Snatching up all the kids
from the mirror, honey.

tattered Victorian lace dress,

I'm living for this look.

934
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,986
[RuPaul] Hey, Shuga Cain,
how's your head?

935
00:36:01,987 --> 00:36:03,555
[Michelle] Say it, Elvira.
Say it.

936
00:36:03,556 --> 00:36:04,723
Haven't had any complaints yet.

It's amazing.

949
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:26,678
I'm really hoping
she gets the reference.

950
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:29,013
[Cara] Oh, skull and bone me.

951
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:31,116

00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:48,099
It's Ariel, witch.

961
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,100
[RuPaul] Michelle,
have you ever seen

962
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,668

[Yvie] For this look,
I wanted to make sure

968
00:36:59,445 --> 00:37:01,179
that I'm clearly reading
as witch,

969
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,214
but with a fashion twist.

970
00:37:03,215 --> 00:37:05,150
All the other witches
in her coven were jealous,

971
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:07,552
so they put this curse on her.

972
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:10,321
But it's not going to stop her
from having a good time.

973
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:11,523

women can't reverse?

The Wiz, as Evillene,
the Wicked Witch of the West.

980
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,474
Don't you bring Miss Evillene
no bad news.

981
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:31,543
[RuPaul] Ease on down
the runway, girl.

If Vanjie
was supposed to be dead,

1009
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:35,106
this is how she would do it.

1010
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,474
I would still look sickening.

1011
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:39,477
I would have my plunging
neckline showing skin.

1012
00:38:39,478 --> 00:38:41,412
My hair's so coiffed,
I got my tombstone on my head,

1039
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:38,670
I feel weird.
I feel fashion.

1040
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:41,706
I feel timeless.

1041
00:39:41,707 --> 00:39:44,142
[RuPaul] Now, you read about
all the mercury in fish,

1042
00:39:44,143 --> 00:39:45,410
but this is ridiculous.

1043
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:47,045
[all laugh]

1044
00:39:47,046 --> 00:39:48,379
[thunder]

1045
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,514
[RuPaul] Nina West.

1046
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:51,482
Oh, look how pretty.

1047
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:52,684
[Cara] Oh.

1048
00:39:52,685 --> 00:39:55,086
[Ross] Oh!

1049
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:56,688
It's a gash, a monster gash.

1050
00:39:56,689 --> 00:39:59,190
[RuPaul laughs]

1051
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:02,694
[Nina] This is a look
that I am very proud of.

1052
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:05,997
I got this House of Wax vibe
where my face is falling off,

1053
00:40:05,998 --> 00:40:08,666
and underneath is this
decayed, deformed woman

1054
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,202
crawling out of the grave,
looking for her long lost love.

1055
00:40:11,203 --> 00:40:15,540
I feel so alive...
and dead in this look.

1056
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:17,275
[Ross] Honey, your lipstick
is smeared a little bit.

1057
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:19,510
[all laugh]

1058
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:22,347
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

1059
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,082
[Elvira] Oh, look at the size
of that snake.

1060
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,284
[Ross]
That's her trouser snake.

1061
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:27,652
[Cara] That's the longest
snake I've ever seen.

1062
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:28,686
Well, the only one.

1063
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:31,489
[all laugh]

1064
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,393
[Ra'Jah] My MILF Eleganza look
is the bone collector.

1065
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,028
Ra'Jah loves to suck
a good bone.

1066
00:40:37,029 --> 00:40:39,764
I'm wearing this sickening
pair of pants made of fur,

1067
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:41,599
and then I throw on
some pasties.

1068
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,403
I am serving you skeleton
drag queen realness.

1069
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,672
[RuPaul] Hey,
when you finish the runway,

1070
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:50,341
could you slip by my house
and snake my drain?

1071
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:51,809
[all laugh]

1072
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,745
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

1073
00:40:53,746 --> 00:40:55,480
[Elvira] Somebody forgot
their bikini wax.

1074
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:57,548
[RuPaul] Working the merkin.

1075
00:40:57,549 --> 00:40:59,450
[Michelle laughs]

1076
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:02,754
[Shuga] I'm feeling this
sexy wife of Satan MILF.

1077
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:06,290
She is giving you body,
feathers and bones

1078
00:41:06,291 --> 00:41:08,526
and full seventies merkin.

1079
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:09,994
I think I'm freakable.

1080
00:41:09,995 --> 00:41:12,663
[Ross] She's so L.A. now.
An L.A. Ram.

1081
00:41:12,664 --> 00:41:14,565
That's a football reference.

1082
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:16,167
[Michelle] Oh, my God,
I got it.

1083
00:41:16,168 --> 00:41:17,535
[RuPaul] Michelle,
have you heard my new song?

1084
00:41:17,536 --> 00:41:20,538
It's called
I am a Merkin, a Merkin.

1085
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:21,639
[all laugh]

1086
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,775
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1087
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:25,076
[Ross] Sissy that walk.

1088
00:41:25,077 --> 00:41:26,744
[all laugh]

1089
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:28,246
[Cara] Citizen Cane?

1090
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:30,515
[Brooke Lynn]
I am a black widow.

1091
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:33,251
This bitch has buried
like five husbands.

1092
00:41:33,252 --> 00:41:35,053
My look's
an off-the-shoulder gown,

1093
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:38,356
with this black tulle wafting
around me almost like smoke.

1094
00:41:38,357 --> 00:41:40,391
I feel dark. I feel spooky.
I feel sexy.

1095
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:43,161
[RuPaul] Get these
motherfucking snakes

1096
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:45,763
off this motherfucking stage.

1097
00:41:45,764 --> 00:41:47,632
[all laugh]

1098
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:50,168
[RuPaul] Ariel Versace.

1099
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:52,537
[Cara]
Areola, the Little Mermaid.

1100
00:41:52,538 --> 00:41:54,705
[Elvira] Now I know why
she calls herself Ariel.

1101
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:56,574
[all laugh]

1102
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:58,810
[Ariel] So a mermaid
and Tinkerbell went into a bar

1103
00:41:58,811 --> 00:42:00,445
and the rest is history.

1104
00:42:00,446 --> 00:42:03,514
She is a creature from the
Jersey Shore covered in scales.

1105
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:06,017
I know these other queens
are green with envy.

1106
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:07,452
[Cara] Nyes.

1107
00:42:07,453 --> 00:42:09,087
[RuPaul] What's that perfume
you're wearing?

1108
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:10,755
[Elvira] Catch of the day?

1109
00:42:10,756 --> 00:42:13,391
[all laugh]

1110
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:15,660
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

1111
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:19,630
[Cara] She must be
a fellow Brit with those teeth.

1112
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:21,566
[Michelle laughs]

1113
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:25,703
[Yvie] My look is this fashion
forward eleganza voodoo doll.

1114
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:30,074
And I've got pieces of frogs
and old hands stuck in my hair,

1115
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:33,644
and my face has got stitches
and a big ol' button eye.

1116
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:35,680
[Michelle] She's serving
lace, lace, lace.

1117
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,615
[RuPaul laughs]

1118
00:42:37,616 --> 00:42:39,517
[thunder]

1119
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:42,487
[RuPaul] And now in a scene
from Macbeth, Dr. Ganache.

1120
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:46,190
[Elvira] Out! Out, damn spot!

1121
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,560
[Silky]
I am a red she-devil.

1122
00:42:49,561 --> 00:42:53,631
Red mermaid gown with leather
and fur hugs all my curves.

1123
00:42:53,632 --> 00:42:56,100
And I changed up my makeup.

1124
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:59,270
Through my beauty, I wanted
to show a little beast.

1125
00:42:59,271 --> 00:43:01,339
I hope those judges
are horny to see me.

1126
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,474
[Michelle]
Elmo, the later years.

1127
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:04,675
[all laugh]

1128
00:43:04,676 --> 00:43:07,078
[thunder]

1129
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,479
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

1130
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,082
Based on your
Monster Ball looks,

1131
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:12,617
I've made some decisions.

1132
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:16,654
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1133
00:43:19,056 --> 00:43:19,857
Nina West.

1134
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:22,693
A'Keria C. Davenport.

1135
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,597
Scarlet Envy.

1136
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:29,133
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1137
00:43:29,134 --> 00:43:31,068
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

1138
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:34,939
Ladies, you are all safe.

1139
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:38,943
You may leave the stage.

1140
00:43:42,246 --> 00:43:44,248
What a bunch of monsters.

1141
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:45,483
[all chuckle]

1142
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:47,752
Ladies, you represent

1143
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:50,221
the treats and the tricks
of the week.

1144
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:52,123
[chuckles]

1145
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:53,724
And now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1146
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:57,194
Up first, Plastique Tiara.

1147
00:43:57,195 --> 00:43:59,096
The trampy trick or treater.

1148
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:01,599
Your body was stunning.
Whoa.

1149
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,668
By the way, I used to work
at a Playboy club.

1150
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:06,437
I wasn't a bunny.
I was cleaning the restroom.

1151
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:10,241
[all laugh]

1152
00:44:10,242 --> 00:44:12,276
Your makeup in all three looks
was incredible.

1153
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:14,145
The MILF Eleganza,
the makeup, the details,

1154
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:16,447
the way you held your mouth,
just perfect.

1155
00:44:16,448 --> 00:44:18,649
[Michelle] This look
is the most fuckable.

1156
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,585
but I'm missing personality.

1157
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:23,387
There's just a pretty you
walking down the runway,

1158
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:26,157
and I'm missing
some kind of a connection.

1159
00:44:26,158 --> 00:44:28,192
All right, let's
move on down to Shuga Cain.

1160
00:44:28,193 --> 00:44:30,661
The Witch Please! I loved.

1161
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:33,164
I love horror movies and I want
to watch that movie right away.

1162
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:34,999
[Elvira] Your trampy
trick or treater,

1163
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,567
I didn't know
what the heck it was.

1164
00:44:36,568 --> 00:44:39,737
The upside is it's something
no one's ever seen before.

1165
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:41,205
[all laugh]

1166
00:44:41,206 --> 00:44:42,740
And hopefully
will never see again.

1167
00:44:42,741 --> 00:44:44,709
[all laugh]

1168
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,511
It was a troll doll.
Those trolls?

1169
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:50,081
So when I was little,
I didn't have a lot of friends,

1170
00:44:50,082 --> 00:44:52,116
and I had tons of trolls,

1171
00:44:52,117 --> 00:44:53,751
those little ones
with the little crazy hair.

1172
00:44:53,752 --> 00:44:56,020
And I used to talk with them
and perform in front of them.

1173
00:44:56,021 --> 00:44:57,588
I just wanted to do something
that meant something to me.

1174
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:59,423
It's a beautiful story.

1175
00:44:59,424 --> 00:45:01,692
Yet you have to tell a story,

1176
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:02,927
so that means we didn't get it.

1177
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:07,365
This MILF just looks messy.

1178
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:09,000
You're better than this.

1179
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:10,668
And the carpet
is not matching the drapes.

1180
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:13,604
It's hard to want to freak
that Merkin, that's the thing.

1181
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,206
I was trying to do
like a tribal,

1182
00:45:15,207 --> 00:45:18,542
like, satanic
like wife of the devil.

1183
00:45:18,543 --> 00:45:21,178
I love the ideas,
but you have to be able

1184
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:22,680
to portray to us
what you're doing.

1185
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:25,349
[RuPaul] Up next,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1186
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:28,152
[Elvira] I particularly loved
the first look,

1187
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:30,721
because I've also
been wrapped up in bandages.

1188
00:45:30,722 --> 00:45:32,256
I'm sure you have.

1189
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:34,025
Well, but I also did it
professionally.

1190
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:35,993
[all laugh]

1191
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:38,129
That costume,
it just was amazing.

1192
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,264
And obviously you're
some kind of ballerina

1193
00:45:40,265 --> 00:45:41,299
or something, right?

1194
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,600
Oh, Lordy.

1195
00:45:42,601 --> 00:45:44,702
[all laugh]

1196
00:45:44,703 --> 00:45:46,270
I could not believe
you were just like la-la-la.

1197
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:48,372
I was just blown away by that.

1198
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:50,708
[Cara] Your Witch Please!,
that kind of looks like

1199
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,710
when I played the Enchantress
in Suicide Squad.

1200
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,345
That's literally
my inspiration.

1201
00:45:54,346 --> 00:45:55,479
-Stop it!
-I found out you were a judge,

1202
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,214
and I was like,
oh, fuck off, no way.

1203
00:45:57,215 --> 00:45:58,716
-[Cara] No way.
-[Brooke Lynn] Yes.

1204
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:00,317
The way you danced, I was
like I should have probably

1205
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:02,420
taken some lessons
before I'd done the movie,

1206
00:46:02,421 --> 00:46:04,188
because that was incredible.

1207
00:46:04,189 --> 00:46:05,456
Thank you.

1208
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:07,525
And then,
this look I freaking love.

1209
00:46:07,526 --> 00:46:09,994
I like that
it's the counter point.

1210
00:46:09,995 --> 00:46:12,229
You're barely moving,
and you still carried it off.

1211
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:14,732
I would borrow this outfit
from you for my day look.

1212
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:16,200
[all laugh]

1213
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,669
Up next, Ariel Versace.

1214
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:20,604
I loved the syringes
coming out the shoulders

1215
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:23,441
in the trampy
trick or treater realness.

1216
00:46:23,442 --> 00:46:24,675
But the bottom
was ill fitting.

1217
00:46:24,676 --> 00:46:27,311
The idea was cute.

1218
00:46:27,312 --> 00:46:30,715
The execution was marginal.

1219
00:46:30,716 --> 00:46:34,652
And your Witch Please!,
I was getting like saloon.

1220
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:36,520
I was trying to do like
an avant-gardey kind of thing.

1221
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:40,191
But it wasn't avant-garde.
It was 1800s.

1222
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:41,726
The glasses were avant-garde,

1223
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:43,594
which had no place
in that outfit.

1224
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:46,664
And then there's nothing
monstrous about this.

1225
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:48,332
This is a mermaid.

1226
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:51,335
[Ariel] I guess
I was just trying to like

1227
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:54,405
rest on something that I knew.

1228
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:56,474
[Ross] Every week,
it's, you know, it's cute.

1229
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:58,375
But it's just
what do you bring?

1230
00:46:58,376 --> 00:47:00,377
-What's your legacy in drag?
-Right.

1231
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:02,646
Are you giving it to us?

1232
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:05,516
[Ariel] I always like
present myself

1233
00:47:05,517 --> 00:47:07,084
as somebody
who's like really strong.

1234
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,420
And for some reason
that hasn't--

1235
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:12,056
I feel like I haven't
been able to show that yet.

1236
00:47:12,057 --> 00:47:13,424
[Ross] Have you ever
watched the show

1237
00:47:13,425 --> 00:47:14,658
and heard other queens
say that same thing?

1238
00:47:14,659 --> 00:47:16,460
Yeah.

1239
00:47:16,461 --> 00:47:17,595
And did you want to scream
at them from your living room?

1240
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:19,330
Yes. Yes.

1241
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:20,698
Here's the deal.
We're five weeks in.

1242
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:21,966
Now's the time to push.

1243
00:47:24,034 --> 00:47:27,004
Yvie Oddly.

1244
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,406
Your trampy
trick or treater look...

1245
00:47:30,207 --> 00:47:32,343
Speechless. Phenomenal.

1246
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:34,411
One of my favorites
in this whole show.

1247
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:36,981
You didn't just come out
as a dinosaur.

1248
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:38,382
You told a story
without any words.

1249
00:47:38,383 --> 00:47:39,750
You have little T-Rex arms.

1250
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:41,218
You can't reach it
when you drop it.

1251
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:43,287
[all laugh]

1252
00:47:43,288 --> 00:47:44,588
I have seen a lot of drag,

1253
00:47:44,589 --> 00:47:47,758
but that really
was in my top 10 list

1254
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:51,195
of most unique,
odd drag moments.

1255
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:53,364
It was just so damn funny.

1256
00:47:53,365 --> 00:47:55,499
And you looked
sort of oddly sexy.

1257
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,001
[laughs]

1258
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,369
Oh, my God, your laugh,

1259
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,271
I tell you, you should laugh
all the time,

1260
00:48:00,272 --> 00:48:02,540
because every time you laugh,
I laugh.

1261
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,508
Unless I'm in a movie theater,
I swear to God.

1262
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:09,046
[all laugh]

1263
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:12,716
The Witch Please! was good
because it was simple,

1264
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:14,652
but it was so tasteful.

1265
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:18,455
You know, the hat going over
one eye, the little glove.

1266
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:19,423
There was something
you could have added,

1267
00:48:19,424 --> 00:48:22,159
something just
that little element more.

1268
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,328
Next time I'll eat a baby.

1269
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:25,396
Great. That's what we want.

1270
00:48:25,397 --> 00:48:27,198
[laughs]

1271
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:28,666
Let's talk about this monster
I'd like to freak.

1272
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:31,569
This is like monster I'd
like to take to a fundraiser.

1273
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,572
[all laugh]

1274
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:36,407
You know what I mean?
I don't get it.

1275
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:38,609
I was just trying to go
for a voodoo doll,

1276
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,612
but I wanted to try to be
a little bit more glamorous.

1277
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:43,614
So this is glamour to you?

1278
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:47,151
[Yvie] I just didn't execute
everything to one vision.

1279
00:48:47,152 --> 00:48:49,153
I kind of picked a few

1280
00:48:49,154 --> 00:48:51,388
and was like that's glamour
and that's punk

1281
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:54,024
and that's Yvie, so here we go.

1282
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:55,526
[Ross]
But when you have a challenge

1283
00:48:55,527 --> 00:48:58,329
that is monster
I'd like to freak--

1284
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,396
and you are a freak...

1285
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:01,131
[laughs]

1286
00:49:01,132 --> 00:49:03,067
Freaking do it.

1287
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,435
When I call you a freak,

1288
00:49:04,436 --> 00:49:05,703
that is the biggest compliment
I can give you.

1289
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:07,271
Oh, girl, I hope so.

1290
00:49:07,272 --> 00:49:08,472
Otherwise people have been
insulting me my whole life.

1291
00:49:08,473 --> 00:49:10,541
No.[all laugh]

1292
00:49:10,542 --> 00:49:12,276
Well, I promise

1293
00:49:12,277 --> 00:49:13,944
I won't ever sabotage myself
with glamour again.

1294
00:49:13,945 --> 00:49:15,946
Well, we still want to see you
do some glamour.

1295
00:49:15,947 --> 00:49:17,414
And, you know,
you've got a couture body.

1296
00:49:17,415 --> 00:49:20,251
You could really rock
something gorgeously.

1297
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:21,652
I'll do it when appropriate.

1298
00:49:21,653 --> 00:49:23,020
We'll hold you to that.

1299
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:27,191
Up next,
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1300
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:30,394
When you did the little
unicorn, adorable.

1301
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:32,062
It was sort of a cute

1302
00:49:32,063 --> 00:49:34,198
children's trick
or treaty thing, you know,

1303
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,600
with sex thrown in, which really
doesn't go together, but...

1304
00:49:36,601 --> 00:49:39,036
Okay, never mind.

1305
00:49:39,037 --> 00:49:40,638
[Ross] Your Witch Please!

1306
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:42,039
It's a reference
to The Wiz, right?

1307
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,207
Absolutely.

1308
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:45,109
I liked that
you went to The Wiz,

1309
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,379
but your hair, your paint,
you were Oprah.

1310
00:49:50,714 --> 00:49:54,285
Now, this last look,
you look so sexy.

1311
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:55,519
You look absolutely gorgeous.

1312
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,720
Thank you.

1313
00:49:56,721 --> 00:49:59,757
But the dress making
is a bit shabby.

1314
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:01,425
I can kind of see places

1315
00:50:01,426 --> 00:50:04,161
where the fur is thicker
on one side, not the other.

1316
00:50:04,162 --> 00:50:05,696
It looked cheap.

1317
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:09,433
And I really don't get monster
besides the horns on your head.

1318
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:12,603
[Elvira] And horns do not
a monster make.

1319
00:50:12,604 --> 00:50:15,639
Ask anybody who was in
Manos: The Hands of Fate,

1320
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,508
an obscure B-movie reference.

1321
00:50:17,509 --> 00:50:19,376
I don't do monster well.

1322
00:50:19,377 --> 00:50:22,046
I only paint one mug,
and it's a beauty mug.

1323
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:22,713
[Michelle] No, I know.
You are a pageant girl

1324
00:50:22,714 --> 00:50:24,548
through and through.

1325
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:28,519
But I have to remind you kids to
really think of the challenge.

1326
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:33,123
[RuPaul] All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

1327
00:50:33,124 --> 00:50:34,558
While you untuck backstage,

1328
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,227
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1329
00:50:37,228 --> 00:50:41,131
All right,
just between us witches,

1330
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:43,200
what do you think?

1331
00:50:43,201 --> 00:50:45,669
Starting with Plastique Tiara.

1332
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,706
Those looks were incredible.
Plastique is stunning.

1333
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:50,341
The colors, she's stunning.

1334
00:50:50,342 --> 00:50:53,143
[Elvira] It's Drag Race.
You need more than just looks.

1335
00:50:53,144 --> 00:50:55,212
You need personality.

1336
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:57,348
[RuPaul] But I love
the fact that her MILF

1337
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:59,550
was actually a monster,

1338
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:02,119
and she took the time
to create a horrific face,

1339
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,587
but still kept the beauty.

1340
00:51:03,588 --> 00:51:05,389
She did a really fine job.

1341
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,559
All right, let's move on.
Shuga Cain.

1342
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,194
[Ross]
The looks were just confusing.

1343
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:12,396
She needs to hand out
a pamphlet with each outfit

1344
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:14,565
so I can figure out
what the hell is going on.

1345
00:51:14,566 --> 00:51:17,101
I was just lost.

1346
00:51:17,102 --> 00:51:18,202
You can see
that she's talented.

1347
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:19,603
She really can
sell a character,

1348
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:23,173
like the Witch Please!,
when she does it properly.

1349
00:51:23,174 --> 00:51:25,509
But that MILF Eleganza, I don't
know what was going on there.

1350
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,177
She tried to make it better
by licking the thing,

1351
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:29,146
but licking
can only take you so far.

1352
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:31,181
[all laugh]

1353
00:51:31,182 --> 00:51:33,150
This was just
not her challenge.

1354
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:35,219
-Uh-huh.
-Mm-mm.

1355
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,788
Let's move on
to Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1356
00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:40,691
I love, love, love,
love, love, love, love,

1357
00:51:40,692 --> 00:51:42,226
love Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1358
00:51:42,227 --> 00:51:43,427
How do you really feel
about Brooke Lynn?

1359
00:51:43,428 --> 00:51:45,629
I may be a little biased.
Whatever.

1360
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:49,199
All of those looks to me
was someone I want to freak.

1361
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,202
[Elvira] Yeah. She captured all
these different macabre looks.

1362
00:51:52,203 --> 00:51:53,737
The mummy,
the witch doctor,

1363
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:56,340
and then that beautiful,
elegant,

1364
00:51:56,341 --> 00:51:58,509
kind of an Addams Family
character.

1365
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:00,177
The costumes were amazing.

1366
00:52:00,178 --> 00:52:02,746
[Cara] Just to watch her move
was hypnotizing.

1367
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:07,051
Yes, that extra element
really pushed it over the top.

1368
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:10,220
Ariel Versace from New Jersey.

1369
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:12,056
I was having
a little bit of déjà vu.

1370
00:52:12,057 --> 00:52:14,058
-I've seen it all before.
-Mm-hmm.

1371
00:52:14,059 --> 00:52:16,693
[Elvira] Nothing super
different, super unique.

1372
00:52:16,694 --> 00:52:19,363
The final look
didn't read monster at all.

1373
00:52:19,364 --> 00:52:20,364
Look, I'm Ariel.
I'm a mermaid.

1374
00:52:20,365 --> 00:52:22,199
Kind of meh-maid.

1375
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,300
[laughs]

1376
00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:25,402
Guys, I'm almost
at a loss with Ariel.

1377
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:28,405
I don't think she knows
what she needs to do.

1378
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:31,742
She has an idea of what she is,
but this competition forces you

1379
00:52:31,743 --> 00:52:35,279
to rethink everything
that worked back home.

1380
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,381
In this context,
you've got to amp it up.

1381
00:52:37,382 --> 00:52:40,050
And if you can't,
you shouldn't be here.

1382
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:41,718
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

1383
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,121
Yvie brought something to
the party that nobody else did,

1384
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,622
and that was humor.

1385
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:48,659
I mean, she put claws on pumps,
you guys.

1386
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,228
[all laugh]

1387
00:52:51,229 --> 00:52:52,763
Has anyone
ever done that before?

1388
00:52:52,764 --> 00:52:54,298
-No.
-No.

1389
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:55,432
Then she dropped the head
and she couldn't get it.

1390
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:57,901
[all laugh]

1391
00:52:59,636 --> 00:53:02,739
[Ross] But that last look
was so bad.

1392
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,074
[Michelle]
There was no monster.

1393
00:53:04,075 --> 00:53:05,442
Nothing that you wanted to eff.

1394
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:07,611
Nothing that I wanted
to eff, marry, or kill.

1395
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:11,048
It's unfortunate that the last
look didn't really hit the mark,

1396
00:53:11,049 --> 00:53:13,283
but I wanted to single her out

1397
00:53:13,284 --> 00:53:16,186
because I was so impressed
with her first two looks.

1398
00:53:16,187 --> 00:53:17,254
-Yeah. Me, too.
-[Michelle] So good.

1399
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:21,725
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache
Zeta-Jones.

1400
00:53:21,726 --> 00:53:24,161
Her trampy trick or treater,
I actually liked that.

1401
00:53:24,162 --> 00:53:25,329
[Cara] But there's something

1402
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:27,097
that could have
made the look better,

1403
00:53:27,098 --> 00:53:30,434
more pronounced
on the detailing, maybe.

1404
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:32,002
And I had trouble
with the second one.

1405
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,037
I thought it was Oprah Winfrey
going as Dolly Parton

1406
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:36,173
for her Halloween costume.

1407
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:38,542
She was being Evillene
from The Wiz,

1408
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:41,745
but Evillene is evil,
and she didn't capture that.

1409
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:43,247
The dress and the makeup

1410
00:53:43,248 --> 00:53:45,649
didn't measure up
to the original at all.

1411
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,351
And the final look,
there was no monster in it.

1412
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:48,619
And the dress,
when she turned around,

1413
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,753
you saw the undergarments.

1414
00:53:49,754 --> 00:53:51,321
It was ill-fitting.

1415
00:53:51,322 --> 00:53:53,223
Silky is such a fun queen,

1416
00:53:53,224 --> 00:53:55,392
I would have liked to see her
have fun with the monster.

1417
00:53:55,393 --> 00:53:56,460
Really go there.

1418
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:58,028
She said
she only paints pretty.

1419
00:53:58,029 --> 00:53:59,696
Well, stretch a little, honey.

1420
00:53:59,697 --> 00:54:01,198
There's $100.000 on the line.

1421
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:02,199
Get ugly, girl.

1422
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,500
Silence.

1423
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,602
Sorry.

1424
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:07,971
I've made my decision.

1425
00:54:07,972 --> 00:54:11,175
Bring back my ghouls.

1426
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:13,110
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

1427
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:14,478
I've made some decisions.

1428
00:54:17,314 --> 00:54:18,348
Plastique Tiara.

1429
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:21,118
Tonight your three looks
were bewitching.

And you're safe.

1442
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:02,993
Thank you.

1443
00:55:04,494 --> 00:55:07,598
Shuga Cain.
Tonight, Shuga don't bite.

1444
00:55:09,533 --> 00:55:12,569
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1445
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,671
[Shuga Cain] I'm mad.

1446
00:55:14,672 --> 00:55:18,308
I did not come here
to be in the bottom again.

1447
00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:20,477
I just worked so hard
to get here.

1448
00:55:20,478 --> 00:55:21,478
It breaks my heart.

1449
00:55:21,479 --> 00:55:23,247
[RuPaul] Ariel Versace.

1450
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:27,751
The only person
you scared tonight is you.

1451
00:55:27,752 --> 00:55:31,388
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1452
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:33,957
Tonight you were all beauty,
no beast.

1453
00:55:37,527 --> 00:55:38,428
Silky.

1454
00:55:40,998 --> 00:55:42,032
You are safe.

1455

You may join the other girls.

1456
00:55:46,704 --> 00:55:49,273
Thank you.

1457
00:55:49,274 --> 00:55:53,610
Ariel, I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1458
00:55:56,179 --> 00:55:59,016
Two queens stand before me.

1459
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,417
Prior to tonight,

1460
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:02,953
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

1461
00:56:02,954 --> 00:56:07,157
of I'm Your Baby Tonight
by the great Whitney Houston.

1462
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:11,628
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1463
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:14,731
and save yourself
from elimination.

1464
00:56:17,467 --> 00:56:19,536
The time has come...

1465
00:56:19,537 --> 00:56:22,205

I want to be here so badly.

1469
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:31,615
I need to kill this lip sync.

1470
00:56:31,616 --> 00:56:36,019
Okay, bitch, it is time
for you to show Mama Ru

1471
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,321
why you are meant to be here,

1472
00:56:37,322 --> 00:56:40,557
'cause tonight,
you are not going home.

1473
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:44,561
