00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,396
[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,865
You'll be starring in LADP.

3
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,266
[siren]

4
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,068
-Get it.
-Ma'am, ma'am.

5
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,970
Oh!

6
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,805
Ma'am, get off the car.

7
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,074
-Grab him.
-Yeah, oh, yeah.

8
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,510
Oh god, hold on.

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,778
I switched roles
with Brooke Lynn

10
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,814
so she would feel
more comfortable,

11
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,350
and it kind of threw me
off my game.

12
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,986
[RuPaul] Vanjie and Plastique.

13
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,988
There was no way
for anyone to get in there.

14
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,257
With both of you,
it was a bit of a free-for-all.

15
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:34,094
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

16
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,063
You always had
new bits happening.

17
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,365
Working with you was one of the
highlights for me yesterday.

18
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:41,068
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

19
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:42,269
[applause]

20
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,604
Vanjie, shantay you stay.

21
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,542
Plastique Tiara, sashay away.

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,251
Whew.

23
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,252
Bitch.

24
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,887
Oh, Lord, girl.

25
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,556
[Shuga] Plastique
has been eliminated,

26
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:06,827
and we are just all so surprised
that she is no longer with us.

27
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,462
[Vanjie]
The bitch has nice handwriting.

28
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,297
Not only is she pretty,
but she got pretty handwriting.

29
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,332
That is a true diva.

30
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,401
[Shuga]
How you feeling, Vanj?

31
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,838
Girl, like
I'm not done fighting.

32
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,440
[Vanjie] So I have a lot of
thoughts going through my head.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,009
A lot of the times,
the judges are telling me

34
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,911
you have this natural born gift,
and they'll praise me on that.

35
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:27,214
But then I go to do that
in a challenge,

36
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,549
and it's almost like,
oh, I just need Vanjie.

37
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,286
I'm trying to figure out
exactly what they want from me.

38
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,988
Like I'm just confused.

39
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,259
[Brooke Lynn]
Congrats, A'Keria.

40
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,727
Who would have thought
your thot twerking ways

41
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,262
would get you a good old win.

42
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,231
Baby.

43
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,033
[laughs]

44
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,501
Do not take that roach with ya.

45
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,070
[all laugh]
They thought you was a roach.

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,240
[Silky] I got called a roach
today, bitch.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,941
A roach.

48
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,377
I guess one thing about roaches,

49
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,979
we don't die,
we multiply, bitch,

50
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,280
so get used to me, honey.

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,949
I ain't dying
in this competition.

52
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,751
[Shuga]
Brooke Lynn, how you feeling?

53
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,319
You like
redeemed yourself today.

54
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,588
[Brooke Lynn] I did. I feel
fantastic that I'm still here.

55
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,092
I worked really hard,
and it fucking paid off.

56
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,827
Congratulations.

57
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,128
Thank you.
I feel amazing.

58
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,196
I didn't know
what to expect going in,

59
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,598
and I couldn't be more happy.

60
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,000
[Nina] She's talking about how

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,668
she was so proud
to be in the top,

62
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,237
but in this challenge, I
worked really closely with her.

63
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,074
She didn't even acknowledge
the work that I helped her with,

64
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,642
and I was kind of like...

65
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,477
that was kind of bullshit.

66
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,711
I mean, I think
Brooke Lynn and I

67
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,280
did a lot
of really good work together,

68
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,183
and I'm proud that Brooke Lynn
was in the top and almost won.

69
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,418
I did. I brought myself
back from the dead.

70
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,020
[Nina] As much as we're friends,

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,890
I made some sacrifices
that I probably shouldn't have.

72
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,859
Brooke Lynn is in it to win it.

73
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,194
I have to focus on myself.

74
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,195
Now let's get
the fuck out of drag.

75
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,963
-All right.
-Done.

76
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,665
Done.

77
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,034

Brooke Lynn, Silky,
and A'Keria

79
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:01,374
are leading our pack
with two wins apiece.

80
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,542
Made it out alive.

81
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,244
Ain't gonna be
in the bottom no more.

82
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,480
[A'Keria] There are
girls falling behind.

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,082
At this point,
get it together or get lost.

84

Plane ticket, train ride, Uber.

85

for today's Mini Challenge,

00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,138
we're playing a game
called Balls to the Wall.

00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,908

You can't use your hands.

Now, instead, I'll pick a card

00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,396
to determine
each pair's position.

00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,466

[bell dings]

179
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,212
[RuPaul] Well done.

180
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,981
I'm determined and I know how
to work these balls, baby.

181
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,850
Wait, bitch, where we going?
Hold on, Barry!

182
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,851
[all laugh]

183
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,885
Drop the thing.

184
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,354
[bell dings]
Yes!

185
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,722
We got in there, baby.

186
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,857
Come on, come on,
hold my wig, hold my wig.

187
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,025
Hold on, put it in the back.

188
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,094
[bell dings]

189
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,729
I might win something!

190
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,796
[all laugh]

191
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,199
Okay, ear to hip.

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,669
Now, Silky, that's your ear
to his hip.

193
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,003
Oh, I got this.

194
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,840
[all laugh]

195
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,041
[Vanjie] What the heck?

196
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,309
[bell dings]

197
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:33,413
[cheers and applause]

198
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,748
What the--

199
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,817
Yo, ladies,
don't you wish gym class

200
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,252
had been this much fun?

201
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,754
[all laugh]
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,821
I wouldn't have quit.

203
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,424
The queen
that buried the most balls

204
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:48,395
in the shortest amount of time
is...

205
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,863
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

206
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,832
[cheers and applause]

207
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,634
Thank you, Jesus.
I won something.

208
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,569
It's a Mini Challenge,
but it's something.

209
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:01,041
You've won a $2.500 gift card
from Dirt Squirrel.

210
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,110
Delta, Pit Crew,

211
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,312
thank you so much
for dropping by.

212
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,614
We had a ball.

213
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,582
-Bye.
-Bye.

214
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,885
-Bye, Delta.
-Bye, Delta.

215
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,554
Ladies,
for this week's Maxi Challenge,

216
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,792
you need to razzle-dazzle,
mystify, and amaze,

217
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,695
as you star
in your very own magic show.

218
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,732
[cheers and laughter]

219
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,935
Now, you'll be performing
in two teams.

220
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,371
Now, Vanjie,
you won the Mini Challenge,

221
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,808
so you get to choose
your magical sisters.

222
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,678
So, Vanjie,
who is your first choice.

223
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,314
Big Silk with the alacazam milk.

224
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,249
Yeah
[all laugh]

225
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,251
Come on, bitch.

226
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,519
All right.
Who's your second choice?

227
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,789
A'Keria.

228
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,925
And who is your third choice?

229
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,564
I'm going to choose Yvie.

230
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,566
All right, so you're going
to play the race card.

231
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,168
[all laugh]
No.

232
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,805
[RuPaul] That means Nina West,
Shuga Cain,

233
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,209
and Brooke Lynn Hytes,
you are the competing team.

234
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,643
All right.

235
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:14,581
Now, in addition to performing
professional illusions,

236
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:18,585
you need to name your magic act,
write captivating patter,

237
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,887
and create a magical look

238
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:24,624
using makeup provided
by Anastasia Beverly Hills.

239
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,092
[Nina] This is what I do.

240
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,694
I produce and I write shows.

241
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:28,728
Look out, David Copperfield,

242
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,929
because I'm about to do

243
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,800
the best reappearing act
in this competition.

244
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,102
Challenge agenda.

245
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,771
Our main challenge this week
is a drag magic show.

246
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,240
I cannot wait.

247
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,976
This is a great opportunity
for us to really be cheesy.

248
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,144
We have to essentially
produce a show.

249
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,213
It requires scripting.
It requires producing.

250
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,449
It requires
learning a magic trick.

251
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,184
So this a huge undertaking.

252
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,952
-I think we can turn this out.
-Absolutely.

253
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,021
[Nina] After last week, I don't
want to fade into the back.

254
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,523
I want to be at the forefront.

255
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,392
So let's figure out
what our storyline is.

256
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,729
Like, what's our relationship?
Are we a sister act?

257
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,298
Are we...

258
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,067
like maybe we're like
all left in an orphanage,

259
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,569
and we're left
to our own devices.

260
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:12,138
And we grow up
in the alleys of Vegas.

261
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,107
I don't know.

262
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,276
So my team
is a team of over-thinkers.

263
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:17,677
[laughs]

264
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,212
I think
we should be single ladies.

265
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,548
I think we should be older.

266
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,516
We're taking a long time
to get where we need to be.

267
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:28,187
Oh, my God, what if we're like
three sorority sisters?

268
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,323
-Like in that fall act.
-Yeah.

269
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,926
Our sorority is what?

270
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,997
This is the one thing
I was worried about.

271
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,533
Because Nina loves
to second-guess.

272
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,435
Brooke loves
to get in her feelings.

273
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,870
And I already do that,

274
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,739
so it's like the blind
leading the blind today, girl.

275
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,308
I don't know.
[laughs]

276
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,243
Like, some da-da-da-da-da.

277
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,312
Um...

278
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:55,782
"You will create a name
for your magic troupe,

279
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,584
the order of illusions, and who
will perform which tricks."

280
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,686
[Yvie] What are some
of the individual illusions?

281
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:02,655
Okay, so we have
the appearing bra trick.

282
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,725
The milk pitcher trick.

283
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,428
The milk magically vanishes
into to the newspaper.

284
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,696
I kind of want to do the milk.

285
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,931
Okay, so I can do
the appearing bra trick.

286
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,467
This is a whole lot
of abracadabra, bitch.

287
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,768
[all laugh]

288
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,638
Let's create a magical name.

289
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,541
We could make a joke about
how we got all the ethnic girls.

290
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,509
[laughs]

291
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,412
The Dark Sided Magicians
or something?

292
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,747
Black Magic.

293
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,450
I think it should be
Da Black Magic, with D-A,

294
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,086
and when something happens,
say, Da Black Magic.

295
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,288
[all laugh]

296
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,890
[Yvie] But for real, though,
do you guys think

297
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,827
the other team is at all peeved
with how things were split up?

298
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:42,161
[Silky] If they upset,

299
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,397
they're only upset because
we are Team Personality.

300
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,299
Like let's be honest about it.

301
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:51,270
Damn, Vanjie, you put all
the girls with the most talent,

302
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,807
the most charm,
the most character,

303
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,478
and the most beauty,
minus Yvie, on the same team.

304
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,214
They destined
to motherfucking fail,

305
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,816
and I live for it.

306
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,585
Hey, cysts.

307
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,720
-Hi.
-Hi, Ru.

308
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,788
How are tricks?

309
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,723
[all laugh]
Business is good.

310
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,593
Shazam, ladies.

311
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,662
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi.

312
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,497
Hi. So you two
have worked together before.

313
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,965
Yes, we have.
Actually quite a bit.

314
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,968
Why do you think Vanjie
didn't you put you on her team?

315
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,438
Aren't you guys very close?

316
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:26,939
She didn't want
our romantic connection

317
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,141
getting in the way of our work.

318
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,742
Is there really
a romantic connection?

319
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,678
Yeah.
We have a situation-ship.

320
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,712
Have you slipped her the tongue?

321
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,714
Several times.

322
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,649
Really?

323
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,384
Have you slipped her
your pinky finger?

324
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,720
[laughs] My God.

325
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,922
You're making me blush, Ru.
No pinky fingers.

326
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,190
And you weren't shocked

327
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,025
that you weren't chosen
for Vanjie's team?

328
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,927
[Brooke Lynn]
This is a competition,

329
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,429
and I don't expect
anything like that.

330
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,831
I don't expect to be chosen
for her team just because...

331
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,533
You're sticking her the pinky.

332
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,601
[all laugh]

333
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,070
I feel like a 12-year-old girl.

334
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,938
[laughs]

335
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,874
Now, do any of you
have any experience in magic?

336
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,676
-None.
-Really?

337
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,877
I can make my eyebrows
disappear.

338
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,312
Yes, you can.

339
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,747
And that's the magic of drag
right there.

340
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:10,283
You know, I love drag
because of the magical aspects.

341
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:13,019
And how we, like Auntie Mame,

342
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,687
can create an illusion

343
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:18,191
out of some duct tape
and paint and powder.

344
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,059
And that's really
what we want to see

345
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,527
in this challenge, you know.

346
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,763
Do you all have a narrative?

347
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,631
-We have several.
-We have several. Yeah.

348
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,601
I think we're finally deciding
to hone in on one, right?

349
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,805
Yeah, we're trying to work
on a couple--an idea.

350
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,874
Now, you haven't won
any challenges.

351
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,042
Not yet.

352
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,610
How are you going
to make that happen?

353
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,480
You know, I think
I'm a little funny.

354
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,814
I do funny sometimes.

355
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,815
Yeah, no, that's why
you're here.

356
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,816
You've got it all.

357
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,618
It's just how do you excel

358
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,853
with all the other girls
who have it all?

359
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,020
Absolutely.

360
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,255
The judges said that Silky

361
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,190
overshadowed me
in the last challenge.

362
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,525
So for this week,

363
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,227
I have to make sure that
I'm going in as a wrecking ball.

364
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,997
And if I feel like I'm doing
enough, I need to do more.

365
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,834
Hey, colored girl magic.

366
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,770
-Hey.
-Hey.

367
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,271
I was surprised
you didn't choose Brooke Lynn

368
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,007
because apparently
you two are an item.

369
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,408
I'm not gonna put my man
in my group.

370
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,378
You know, get your own--
go on your side with, you know.

371
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,780
When he had the chance
to pick people,

372
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,348
he picked Nina, and I
wasn't pressed about it.

373
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,416
He's doing good
in this competition.

374
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,785
I need to worry about myself.

375
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:20,686
I'm thinking what's
going to make me win

376
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,421
and excel in this challenge?

377
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,691
I'm thinking with this,
not with this or this.

378
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,928
Do any of you have experience
with magic?

379
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,631
You know, I made some men
disappear in my day.

380
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:34,333
[Vanjie] Right, right.

381
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:38,070
I go from trucker
to a woman in 25 minutes.

382
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,338
Like that is true magic.

383
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:41,007
Do you really see yourself
as a trucker

384
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,241
before you get into drag?

385
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,610
[all laugh]

386
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,778
I would like to know

387
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,014
what scares you
about this challenge.

388
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,082
Probably what happened
last week,

389
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,418
which was just watching
a train wreck happening,

390
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:56,522
not being able to stop
the train from wrecking.

391
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,357
Yeah. You started at 10.

392
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,892
There's nowhere to go
from there.

393
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,096
Planning out in advance is going
to be something you need to do.

394
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,598
[Vanjie] Right. I completely--

395
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,099
I want you to know
that I am listening.

396
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:08,801
I understand
exactly what you're saying.

397
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,936
[RuPaul] Well, listen, ladies,

398
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:12,205
I cannot wait
to see Da Black Magic.

399
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,372
Let me get right back
to writing.

400
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,640
Let me get back
to writing my script.

401
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,741
All right.

402
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,444
I have a lot to prove still.

403
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,146
I just need to make sure
when we slay this,

404
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,882
that I'm like
slam dunking this thing.

405
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,517
You know, I need to go
Michael Jordan on them.

406
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,152
That's a straight reference
for the people out there.

407
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,955
Superbowl Sunday Beyoncé this.

408
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,756
I need my moment.

409
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,059
-Hi.
-Hi.

410
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,660
How's it going?

411
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,630
[Shuga] It is time for us to
learn some magic tricks, honey.

412
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,998
My name is Kyle Marlett.

413
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,001
I'm a magician and a magic
creator from Las Vegas,

414
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,437
and Ru invited me here
to teach you guys some magic.

415
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,805
You guys all ready
for some magic?

416
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,073
-Yes.
-Yes.

417
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,845
[all] Aah!

418
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,283
All right.
[cheers and applause]

419
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:59,118
[Kyle] All right, let's get
started doing some magic.

420
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,920
What trick
are you going to be doing?

421
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,623
-I'm doing the swallowing sword.
-Oh, boy.

422
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,992
Now, this one is technically
actually kind of dangerous.

423
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,560
I'm going to show you first.

424
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,165
What?

425
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,367
[Shuga]
Is he really doing this?

426
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,135
-So you actually swallow that?
-Mm-hmm.

427
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,237
[muffled] It's in my throat.

428
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,238
Girl.

429
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,873
What?

430
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:28,014
Hmm.

431
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:31,450
So it's like...

432
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,119
Mm.

433
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,855
Now you try. Okay, so go ahead
and put it in your mouth.

434
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:40,793
And just kind of nom on it,
basically.

435
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,262
Oh, nothing has happened.
Okay.

436
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,630
[all laugh]

437
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,866
I have tricks fail on me
all the time.

438
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,235
But it's important to hide that
in your presentation.

439
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,304
You cover up your mistakes
with comedy.

440
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,505
I'll just ask for the Pit Crew.

441
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,540
Maybe I can try
to swallow those instead.

442
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:56,876
All right.

443
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,077
We'll move on
to the next person.

444
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,313
Step up up.
[laughs]

445
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,114
I love it, I love it.

446
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,686
Perfect.
All right, the milk trick.

447
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,155
It's very important
that it's 2%.

448
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,423
I'm kidding.
That has nothing to do with it.

449
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,958
[all laugh]

450
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,493
So you can roll it up
into a cone like so.

451
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,629
And now you're going
to take some milk.

452
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,431
You're slowly going to pour it.

453
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,001
Now you say the magic words.
What are the magic words?

454
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,202
-Mm, boom.
-Right, right?

455
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,171
Boom!

456
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,139
-It's gone.
-What?

457
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,308
Oh! Oh, my goodness.

458
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,310
-It's pretty cool, right?
-You ready for me to try it?

459
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,878
Yeah. It's actually
really, really easy.

460
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,180
-I'll tell you when.
-Ooh.

461
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,983
I don't know why you're moaning,
but keep going.

462
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,617
More. More, more.

463
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,519
-Shit.
-Okay. All right.

464
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,654
[all laugh]

465
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:42,855
Now, you know,
at the end of the day,

466
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,256
you got to let
the trade know, you know--

467
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,825
oops--there's
a little bit there still.

468
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:48,527
Okay. And now you snap
and say boom.

469
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:49,762
Boom!

470
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,797
Ain't shit there.

471
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,933
[all laugh]

472
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,668
Where the milk at, bitch?

473
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,069
[Kyle] And what's your
presentation during this?

474
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,771
Your patter and everything.

475
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,072
So, you know, uh,
you know, the gentlemen

476
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:01,841
like to skeet all over your--
They milk all over your--

477
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,309
your face and stuff.

478
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,812
No more.
Aim for the cone,

479
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,147
and it will be gone.

480
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,352
That's obviously for more
of an adult audience, right?

481
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,654
We gonna have children here?

482
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,722
Work on your script,
work on your presentation.

483
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,158
[Shuga] What I'm noticing
from Team Personality

484
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,627
is that a lot of their stuff
is really off-color.

485
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,396
It's kind of filthy.

486
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:26,565
The magic show
is supposed to be PG-13,

487
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,335
and right now, it's just
reading kind of tasteless.

488
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,539
So this one's a little tricky,
but it's definitely fun.

489
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,341
So I'll show you first,
all right?

490
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,642
-Okay.
-Glass over here.

491
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,245
Wine bottle here.
Empty tube, right?

492
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,312
Ready?

493
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,649
One, two, and three.

494
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,786
What? Okay,
but how do you do that?

495
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:49,555
All right, so you try it,
and really fast.

496
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,790
Boom. You did it.

497
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,259
I'm a magician.

498
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,161
I'm trying, I'm trying,
Mary, I'm trying.

499
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,228
Oh, no.

500
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,396
No, that's not right.

501
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,864
That's not what
you're supposed to do.

502
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,232
[all laugh]

503
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,734
I'm really trying
to get my trick down,

504
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,502
and add these nuances

505
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:06,839
of almost like this
Chris Farley-esque magician.

506
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,441
And what is your presentation
for this?

507
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,343
So won't we look prettier
if we're all drunker.

508
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,411
Shots all around.

509
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,479
That's pretty good, right?

510
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,647
I mean, that's pretty good.

511
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,981
[Yvie] As we watch
the other team,

512
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,884
I'm like, fuck,
they've got humor,

513
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,554
they've obviously
got rehearsed lines.

514
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,457
It's definitely making me
nervous for my team.

515
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,892
[Kyle] All right, we'll move on
to the next person.

516
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,260
So hold this
in your dominant hand.

517
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,329
And take the lid,
put it on top of the pan.

518
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,498
Yep, all the way down.

519
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:33,999
Do your magic wave,
your presentation.

520
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,936
-Shabam, alacazam.
-Yeah.

521
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,571
Oh!

522
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,839
-Pretty good, right?
-That is great.

523
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,474
So this is a really,
really easy one, right?

524
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,576
So it's all presentation
with this one.

525
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,644
[Shuga] My magic trick,
it's actually pretty easy.

526
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,912
Thank the Lord, honey.

527
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,248
So now I can just focus
on putting on a show

528
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,283
so that it looks like fantastic.

529
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,586
Thank you.
This is amazing.

530
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,193
[snoring]

531
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,862
Yes.

532
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,664
[snoring]

533
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,867
[laughs]

534
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,170
So I'm going to show you
with the playing cards,

535
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,972
but you can use
anything you want, all right?

536
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,306
I will be honest.
This is probably

537
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,242
one of the hardest tricks
that you could do.

538
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,376
[Brooke Lynn] Good.

539
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,944
So I'm glad
you picked this one.

540
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,379
So happy, too.

541
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,381
What?
[laughs]

542
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,116
Where--wh-what?

543
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,885
Take the card.

544
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,386
[Brooke Lynn] What?

545
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,856
Whew. Whooch.
I'll let you try.

546
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,324
So hold it between your fingers.
Give it a spin.

547
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,426
And--okay.

548
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,096
I don't--

549
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,931
I've never seen
this technique before.

550
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,366
[all laugh]

551
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,101
Don't be so awkward, okay?

552
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,135
Just remember, you've got
to use your presentation,

553
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,303
you understand, right?

554
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,105
I don't want you
to be stressed out though.

555
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,339
-I'm not.
-I know magic's hard.

556
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,675
I stress out about everything.

557
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,978
Take the card,
and let me know how that goes.

558
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,681
-All right.
-I hate this.

559
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,216
[Shuga] Brooke is struggling.
She hates it.

560
00:21:57,216 --> 00:21:59,818
She don't want to it.
She can't get it.

561
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,454
She is over this trick.

562
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,689
And we have to be amazing,

563
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,891
because we are up against
Team Personality.

564
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,463
[Nina] I feel really
confident about what I'm doing,

565
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,132
but there's no doubt in my mind
that Brooke Lynn,

566
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,500
after watching the other team

567
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,836
and seeing
gigantic personalities,

568
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:17,937
I think she's in her head
a little bit

569
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,572
and saying
how do I sell the trick?

570
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:23,409
This could derail our
whole team's goal of winning.

571
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:24,577
This is like
a do-or-die situation.

572
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,711
I'm not going home
after the challenge.

573
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,950
[humming]

574
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,352
Disappear, disappear, disappear.

575
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,620
After learning our magic

576
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,022
and watching
the other team's production,

577
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,593
it's quite clear that we need
a hell of a lot more structure.

578
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,994
Ugh.

579
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:45,331
[Yvie] So we should start
working on the format.

580
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,966
I think yours is going to be
the biggest segment

581
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,500
where we're going
to need to pad it up

582
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,169
since A'Keria's
going to have her mouth full.

583
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,638
Like we should have
some jokes prewritten

584
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,607
so that we
can just pop those out.

585
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,475
[A'Keria] I think it should be
one of those situations

586
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,643
where it just comes
straight off the head

587
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,478
versus us writing it down now.

588
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,983
Well, like, obviously
we can talk and kiki,

589
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,852
but like I think it needs
to be a little organized.

590
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,721
I think it should be
like we casually talking,

591
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,356
and it's just like, you know--

592
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,826
I think we just need like some
transitions between our pieces.

593
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,764
We have some people
that want to improv

594
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,933
and some people that want
to write their parts down

595
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,235
and I'm trying
to people-please everybody.

596
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,172
So I'm not saying we need
to maybe make a specific.

597
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:29,541
[Yvie]
But like it goes wrong--

598
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,609
[Vanjie]
We need to have something--

599
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,910
[Yvie]
Stuff to lean back on.

600
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,446
But everybody can just
play off of each other,

601
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,081
because we do have
that chemistry.

602
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,917
[Yvie] Silky and A'Keria

603
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,287
want to improv their way through
this whole challenge.

604
00:23:41,287 --> 00:23:44,423
I'm just kind of tired
of fighting all of them.

605
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,558
But in the back of my head,

606
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,694
I still know we need
some more structure.

607
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:53,065
The only thing I think that does
super need to be written down

608
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,200
and rehearsed is the intro.

609
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,069
Now let's go over
this intro for sure.

610
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,004
[Yvie] Okay. I'm going to
write out these lines then.

611
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,975
My group is a bunch
of strong, opinionated girls,

612
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,743
and I thought that
was going to be the bonus.

613
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:05,978
It might be the downfall.

614
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,583
[cheering]

615
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,218
Come on.

616
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,387
Oh, Lord.

617
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,989
[Vanjie] Today
is elimination day,

618
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:20,526
and we have to perform this
magic show for the judges.

619
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:23,028
I feel like somebody
gonna disappear tonight.

620
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,530
Bippity-boppity-bye.

621
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,498
[Silky]
Can I put my magic in you?

622
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,534
Oh, you can put your magic in me
any time, Silk.

623
00:24:28,534 --> 00:24:29,902
Wherever you want
to put your magic.

624
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:33,439
Brooke Lynn and Nina are
definitely feeling better today.

625
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,775
We practiced last night.
It came together.

626
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,043
Ah, it's gonna work.

627
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,478
♪ Whoo ♪

628
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,214
[A'Keria] I'm having a bad day.

629
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,216
There's so much
running through my head.

630
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,951
I'm definitely still worried
about my team.

631
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:49,254
I'm just really like not
in a good space right now.

632
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,357
[Yvie] Hey, Miss A'Keria,
how you feeling?

633
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:55,594
I'm not in my spirit.
Like I'm just--I don't know.

634
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,062
[Yvie]
Why not? What's the Tee?

635
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:58,931
[A'Keria] I'm just not
myself right now.

636
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,966
Yeah, because you seem
a little mellow for you today.

637
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,869
Yeah. I'm just
kind of like in my head.

638
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,039
[Nina] I noticed A'Keria
is really down.

639
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,474
Like you can tell
she's frustrated,

640
00:25:08,474 --> 00:25:10,609
and obviously
it's regarding the challenge.

641
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,177
Silk, how you guys feeling?

642
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,545
[Silky]
I'm not sure if I even know.

643
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,348
We basically had to change
our entire show last night.

644
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,516
Why?

645
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,452
Because our jokes
were a little too dirty.

646
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,321
We were too explicit.

647
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:23,856
Rated R.

648
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,325
[all laugh]

649
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,793
[Yvie] We're just going
to have to make sure

650
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,062
that it's on in there
for the cameras when it counts.

651
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,330
[Nina] Yeah, that's true.

652
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,532
Of course,
the competition mind in me

653
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,834
is like, okay, well, one
of them's got a clipped wing,

654
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,704
and it sounds like they're
working on a completely new act.

655
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,839
So A'Keria could be in trouble.

656
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:44,743
[Silky]
I got a question for you all.

657
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:46,745
If we could use magic to
change one thing in the world,

658
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,746
what would it be?

659
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,014
I think by taking away war,

660
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,716
we could solve
so many problems in the world.

661
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,985
[Silky] Brooke Lynn, you're not
competing for a Continental.

662
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,354

change something

00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,491
that's happened throughout
this competition so far,

665
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,759
what would it be?

666
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,094
[Yvie] Ooh.

667
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,695
[Shuga] I would have burned
that troll outfit, girl.

668
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:04,897
Yeah.

669
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,298
You still should.

[Silky] What would you
have changed, Vanjie?

673
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,572
If I could go back in time,
I would not pack 46 swimsuits.

I'll meet you down at Cottesloe.

698
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,308
Be there.
See ya, mate.

699
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,711
[laughs]

700
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,247
[RuPaul] Good on ya, mate.
Hilly dilly.

701
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:29,848
And Gina Rodriguez.

702
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:32,017
Now, are you
a Drag Race virgin?

703
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,886
My legs are not crossed
under this table.

704
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:35,587
[laughs] Prove it.

705
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:37,923
Rrrrrrr.

706
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:38,924
So excited you're here.

707
00:27:38,924 --> 00:27:40,526
It's great to be here, Ru.

708
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,227
This week,
we challenged our queens

709
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,696
to put on a drag-tastic
magic show.

710
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,065
And tonight on the runway,

711
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,935
category is Caftan Realness.

712
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:54,173
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

713
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,677
[cheers and applause]

714
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,279
[RuPaul] Let the magic show
begin.

715
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,150
[Gina] Yes. [laughs]

716
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,387
Ladies and gentlemen...

717
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,888
Boys and girls.

718
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,824
I am Shuga Shablam Alacazam.

719
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,393
And I'm Bubbly Brooke.

720
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,499
[all laugh]

721
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:23,669
Girl, where is Nina?

722
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,870
Football practice?

723
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,738
[all laugh]

724
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,373
I'm checking her dressing room.

725
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,374
Open sesame.

726
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,413
Girl, she is not
even fucking in here.

727
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,949
Well, like they say
in show business...

728
00:28:36,949 --> 00:28:39,217
-Fuck her.
-No, Mary.

729
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,987
Magic waits for no queen.

730
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,056
-We're titillating.
-We're tantalizing.

731
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,058
We're dudes.

732
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,659
[laughter and applause]

733
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,862
Better late than pregnant,
I always say.

734
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,065
I'm Naughty Nina,

735
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,100
and our journey begins
five years ago,

736
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,936
where three young ladies
had blue eye shadow,

737
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,573
duct tape, and a dream
of...[whispers] magic.

738
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,874
[all laugh]

739
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,811
Now, there are a few rules
at every drag show.

740
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:08,280
So rule number one:

741
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,249
the more you drink,
the prettier we look.

742
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,685
But, Shuga,
this is a drag magic show,

743
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:15,120
so I actually think
the first rule is

744
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,055
the more we drink,
the better they look.

745
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,790
Touché.

746
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,426
Which leads us to our first
trick, ladies and gentlemen.

747
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,831
Bippity, boppity,
glug-glug-glug-glug, booze.

748
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,601
We take a bottle of Merlot
and a shot glass.

749
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,104
All I want to do is replace
the bottle with the shot glass,

750
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,472
the shot glass with the bottle.

751
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,340
We all on the same page?
Great.

752
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,675
[all laugh]

753
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,911
I cover the bottle
with this lovely empty canister.

754
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,513
You can shove your fist
in it, too.

755
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,749
It's been lubed with Crisco.

756
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:47,319
Then we take
this other empty cani--

757
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,321
I'll save this one
for after the show.

758
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,456
We cover our shot glass.

759
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,459
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm
gonna need your help here, okay?

760
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,062
When I count to three, I need
you to say that magical word

761
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,330
that's going to make it
all happen:

762
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,531
tucktastic.

763
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,833
One, two, three.

764
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,201
[all] Tucktastic.

765
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,103
Aah!

766
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,171
Wow.

767
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,439
[cheers and applause]

768
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,374
Magic!

769
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:10,842
[all laugh]

770
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,078
Shall we do it again?
Do you dare me to do it again?

771
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,813
We will do it again,
ladies and gentlemen.

772
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,049
One, two, three.

773
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,250
Tucktastic!

774
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,484
Oh.

775
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,387
I think there's an alcoholic
in our midst,

776
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,622
and it's me.

777
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,759
But looks like
I have a bottle for Ross...

778
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,630
a bottle for Michelle...

779
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,132
a bottle for Mama Ru...

780
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:37,636
a bottle for Gina...

781
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,638
a bottle for Katherine...

782
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,907
a bottle for Brooke...

783
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:44,376
a bottle for Shuga...

784
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,411
and a shot for me,
ladies and gentlemen.

785
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,115
That is bippity, boppity, boo.

786
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,451
[cheers and applause]

787
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:58,023
Rule number two is cleanliness
is close to goddessness.

788
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,026
Now, if only there was a queen

789
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,695
who had some dirty,
raunchy tights around.

790
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,599
[all laugh]

791
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,234
Ooh, pee-eew.

792
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,837
How long's it been since
you've washed your tights?

793
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:14,539
September...2015.

794
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,640
[all laugh]

795
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,244
[grunting] Aah!

796
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,079
Whew. Those are fragrant.

797
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,347
Now I know
what Vanjie feels like.

798
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,648
[all laugh]

799
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:27,552
These definitely need
some magic detergent.

800
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,921
Ooh, shablam.

801
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,757
-Ooh.
-So does this, girl.

802
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,396
Shuga Slablam. Alacazam.

803
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,665
Fresh tuck panties.

804
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,100
[cheers and applause]

805
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,502
[whispers] Magic.

806
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,503
[all laugh]

807
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:47,105
That brings us to Rule three:

808
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:50,442
illusion is everything.

809
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,278
Now, me and these bubbles
have a lot in common.

810
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,180
You see, these bubbles dance.

811
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,516
They are light and flowy
like air.

812
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,884
[whispers] Magic.

813
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:03,288
We both move with the power
of a thousand seas.

814
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,856
[all laugh]

815
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,258
[whispers] Magic.

816
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,127
The thing we have the most
in common is my tuck.

817
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,128
[whispers] Magic.

818
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,298
You see,
they're soft to look at,

819
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:15,767
but hard to the touch.

820
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,470
[applause]

821
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,105
Ladies and gentlemen,

822
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:23,408
no stunt has been pulled on
the Drag Race stage like this

823
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:26,745
since Valentina said "I'd
like to keep it on, please."

824
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,180
[all laugh]

825
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,681
Now, Brooke Lynn Hytes
doesn't know this,

826
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:33,051
but she's going to step ever so
gently into this big wooden box.

827
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:34,619
What?

828
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,288
-Go ahead, baby.
-What's happening?

829
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,522
-Don't worry about it.
-Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.

830
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,590
What--what--what?

831
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,758
Oh, I feel very uncomfortable.

832
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:42,160
Saturday night for me.
Get in the box.

833
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,663
I feel very attacked
right now!

834
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,631
[all laugh]

835
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,502
Also, Shug, this is a great way
to get it down to a final six.

836
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:53,505
Amen. Eliminate the competition.

837
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:54,840
Oh, thank you, dear.

838
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,742
I haven't been on top
in a while.

839
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,810
We know.

840
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,345
[all laugh]

841
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,847
-One.
-One.

842
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,615
-Two.
-Two.

843
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,617
Three!

844
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,520
[cheers and applause]

845
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,721
Magic!

846
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,357
It's a heavy flow day.

847
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,593
Halleloo, I'm back, bitches.

848
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,894
Ladies and gentlemen,

849
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:18,630
you've just witnessed
the reverse Shangela!

850
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,699
[all laugh]

851
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,034
[Shuga] I'm a little brown
woman in a big brown box.

852
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,035
Oh!

853
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,537
[all laugh]

854
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:28,139
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

855
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,142
Halleloo times two.

856
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,179
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Bubbly Brooke.

857
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,614
I'm Naughty Nina.

858
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,316
And I'm Shuga Shablam Alacazam.

859
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,385
And together we are...

860
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,621
[all] The Mighty Tucks!

861
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,622
[cheers and applause]

862
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,690
[all] Magic.

863
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,927
Magic...
Magic...

864
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,328
Magic.

865
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:55,166
And the tricks
just keep on coming.

866
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,369
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

867
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,104
Thank you all for coming.

868
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,946
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and squirrels,

869
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:11,683
I welcome you
to our dark mystical world.

870
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,619
Deeper than my tuck,
but hotter as hell.

871
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:17,622
It's even worse than a cold
blank stare from Michelle.

872
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:18,957
[laughs]

873
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,826
Straight from the light
and all that is tragic,

874
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,595
and you'll find my sisters.

875
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,498
We are Da Black Magic.

876
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,134
The Black Magic.

877
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,336
Ooh, Da Black Magic.

878
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,872
Da Black Magic.

879
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,774
[Yvie] Da Black Magic.

880
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,876
Da Black Magic.

881
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:40,445
-Oh, Da Black Magic.
-Mm-hmm.

882
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,647
Da Black Magic.

883
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:46,151
[cheers and applause]

884
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,022
I am Yvie the Oddball.

885
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,725
I'm Big Silk Boom.

886
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,161
And I'm Vanishing Vanjie.

887
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,129
All right,
now let's get this--wait.

888
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:01,099
One, two, three.

889
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,400
Where's Miss Thing?

890
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,835
-She--
-Can we go get her?

891
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,970
She better not be gone.

892
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,171
Bippity bop
and titties that flop.

893
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:09,441
Look out, girl,
it's Azakazam A'Keria.

894
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,142
-Yeah.
-Oh, girl.

895
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:14,512
And together, we are...

896
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,649
[all] Da Black Magic.

897
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:19,584
[cheers and applause]

898
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:24,022
We are the world's
first troupe of magicians

899
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:26,558
who travel
from barbeque to barbeque.

900
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,959
It's a little cold
in here, baby.

901
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,594
I'm feeling the breeze.

902
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,430
That's 'cause you don't have
a bra, a panties, anything.

903
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,232
How indecent--

904
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,934
When do I ever?

905
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,168
True.

906
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,304
This is a children's
function, though.

907
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,206
And where there are kids,
there are baby daddies,

908
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,542
which means I can find
the Adam for my Yvie.

909
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,479
But I know it's not easy

910
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,615
to tie the knot.

911
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,017
Look, I did it. I did--

912
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,218
That's a real knot, y'all.

913
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:55,253
[all laugh]
Come on.

914
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,656
Ooh, now let's see
if I can whip up a bra

915
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,491
for my baby over here.

916
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,627
Ooh...oh...

917
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,630
Bippity, boppity, bra.

918
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,099
[cheers and applause]

919
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,367
Look at this cute

920
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,437
over-the-shoulder
boulder holder.

921
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,372
She'll hold some jugs.

922
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,174
Did someone say jugs?

923
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,477
Jugs of milk...shake?

924
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,046
[all laugh]

925
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:24,082
My milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard.

926
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,251
And so I gotta get that
to the barbeque

927
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,253
as soon as possible, honey,

928
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,122
so I got to teleport it
with this sheet of paper.

929
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,359
Ooh, baby.

930
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,095
Ahh, baby.

931
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:38,296
Roll it up, baby.

932
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,564
Wind it, baby.

933
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,999
-Wind it.
-Ooh.

934
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,002
And now we pour.

935
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:45,637
Oh.

936
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:49,207
[A'Keria] Oh, girl.
No drop left behind, baby.

937
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,608
[Vanjie] I've never seen you
this concentrated.

938
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:51,876
Mm.

939
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,813
-Oh, girl.
-She's feeling her Elsie.

940
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,614
[Yvie] Oh, it's still going.

941
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,016
Oh, how much can you fill?

942
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,717
Now let's feel if she's dry.
I feel a little thirsty.

943
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,386
-Thank you, sis.
-I got you, girl.

944
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,054
I got you, girl.

945
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,390
All right, fee fi fo fum.

946
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,392
Look out, throat, here it comes.

947
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,595
Oh, where'd it go, baby?

948
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:11,930
That's some good shit
right there.

949
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,965
Oh, I know there's going
to be a lot of boys

950
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,900
at this barbeque, honey.

951
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,669
Speaking of the barbeque,

952
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,971
if this bitch don't have
condiments at this barbeque,

953
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,206
I'm gonna beat her ass,

954
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,675
because I had to have
a dry hot dog last time.

955
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:27,879
Girl, y'all won't believe
what just happened to me

956
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,248
-at the grocery store.
-Tell 'em, boo.

957
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,584
I went in there trying to get
the condiments for the barbeque.

958
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,586
The lady said, ma'am,

959
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,187
whatever you have in that bag,
you didn't pay for.

960
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:38,289
I said,
what are you talking about?

961
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,291
She said, open up the bag,
show me the ketchup.

962
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:41,826
I said, what are you
talking about, this?

963
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,929
She said, yeah, that.
You didn't pay for it.

964
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,365
I said, ain't nothing--
no ketchup in here, baby.

965
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,867
I had to get it together,

966
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,269
and I said, look,
what's in the bag, Christine?

967
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,770
What's in the bag?

968
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,439
I know you gagging.
I can see you.

969
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:58,376
And I said I don't got ketchup
in the bag.

970
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,814
I got mustard in the bag.

971
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,049
Okay, I see y'all are gagged.
Ain't nothing in the bag.

972
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,218
She said, well, flip it
to the other hand, Mary,

973
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,520
if you think you so cute.

974
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,023
I said, okay,
ain't nothing in the bag still.

975
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,925
You know what?
I'm about to show you

976
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,326
what's really in the bag.

977
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,961
Da Black Magic, mama.

978
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,263
Ain't nothing in the bag.

979
00:38:18,263 --> 00:38:20,331
Ain't no ketchup.
Ain't nothing.

980
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,701
Now, A'Keria, what you
bringing to this barbeque?

981
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,003
Oh, girl, you know,

982
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,704
I got to bring to this barbeque
my old trick.

983
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,039
I'm gonna show you

984
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,741
why I am the most popular girl
at the barbeque.

985
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:32,377
Just gonna pump this
right on up.

986
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:34,913
All right, just like that.

987
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,848
'Tis a jiggle,
and hip that do, too.

988
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:39,551
Watch out, y'all, I'm gonna
take this down to the zoo.

989
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,821
[Yvie] Oh, girl.
Oh, my. Ooh.

990
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,660
-How's she doing that?
-I don't know.

991
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,662
[Michelle]
She must be popular.

992
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,996
Oh, you're almost there, girl.

993
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,598

996

You know, it also works
for a low cal diet.

997
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,742
[Vanjie]
Girl, after watching that,

998
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,378
y'all know I got
a little bit of the itis,

999
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,881
'cause that means
you done ate a lot of food,

1000
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,015
and you're getting
a little sleepy.

1001
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,284
Well, I just got a lot of gas.

1002
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,852
Well, lucky for you,

1003
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,156
I know the oldest trick
in the Black Magic book.

1004
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:22,026
Okay, girl, you're gonna need to
lay yourself on this magic table

1005
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,895
so that
we can get you some rest

1006
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:26,431
that's light as a feather,
but stiff as a board.

1007
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,832
Magic table?

1008
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,501
Let's wrap her up tight
so she gets that good sleep.

1009
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,070
Mm-hmm.

1010
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:36,441
What's the Tee, Christine?
What's the Tee, Christine?

1011
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,343
What's the--?

1012
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,544
Yeah, still works.

1013
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:43,014
Oh, oh, I feel
Da Black Magic in me.

1014
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:45,049
Girl, I think it's time.

1015
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,551
Oh!

1016
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,554
-All right.
-Keep pulling on out, girl.

1017
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,389
Oh!

1022
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:03,668
But wait. We're gonna be late
for our next barbeque.

1023
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,837
We'd better fix this table
and wake her up.

1024
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:07,071
Oh, girl.

1025
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,072
Oh.

1026
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,073
Girl, I need my plate.

1027
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,476

00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,595
[Ross] She's going ball.

1051
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,331
[all laugh]

1052
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:09,467
[RuPaul] This is the mahogany
fantasy, darling.

1053
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,169
I'm a winner, baby.

1054
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:12,737
Yvie Oddly.

1055
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,872
Holy caftan.

1056
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,107
[Katherine]
Hello, Your Holiness.

1057
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,608
[all laugh]

1058
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,477
[Yvie] Because it's
a fabulous caftan challenge,

1059
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,014
I want to serve
100% enlightened monk realness.

1060
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:26,284
Just gliding down the runway
spreading peace.

1061
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,554
It's got this train that
sweeps the runway behind me.

1062
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,122
[Michelle] Crochet!

1063
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,623
[all laugh]

1064
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,928
-What? Ow.
-Ooh.

1065
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,563
[RuPaul] My goodness.

1066
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:39,664
[Ross] She deserves
a pat on the back.

1067
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,466
-She certainly does.
-From herself.

1068
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:42,700
[all laugh]

1069
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,269
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

1070
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,938
That bitch is fly.

1071
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,239
[Michelle] Yes, honey.

1072
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,341
Fly, fly, fly, fly.

1073
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,710
[A'Keria] So, baby,
mama is feeling

1074
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,812
so fierce on this stage.

1075
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,249
My caftan is a pantsuit
with butterfly wings.

1076
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,184
The fabric is flowing,
and I just feel like

1077
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,987
I am going to take flight
at any moment.

1078
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,722
[Ross] You butta fly.

1079
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:06,724
[RuPaul] She just
came out of her cocoon.

1080
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:08,826
What did I just call me?

1081
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,697
What did I just call me?
[all laugh]

1082
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,466
[RuPaul]
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo. Ooh.

1083
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,702
[Michelle] From
the Jackie Stallone collection.

1084
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,170
[RuPaul] Yes.

1085
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,540
[Vanjie] I'm extra, extra,
caftan all about it.

1086
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,742
Cheetah print head to toe.

1087
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,377
I'm a white lady on vacation.

1088
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,745
I put that turban on

1089
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,714
just in case a little
splash of water, bitch.

1090
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,416
I made sure my little
baby hairs are laid down.

1091
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,951
I'm looking like when those
bitches go on a vacation,

1092
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,620
and they put all their shit on.

1093
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,455
[Ross] If you like it, then you
better put a nose ring on it.

1094
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,357
[all laugh]

1095
00:42:39,357 --> 00:42:41,659
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1096
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,327
[Gina]
That's a plum choice.

1097
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,530
[RuPaul]
It certainly is. Ooh.

1098
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,567
[Brooke Lynn] I'm giving you
fucking sexy caftan realness.

1099
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,602
It's like
a little bit Studio 54,

1100
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,905
a little bit Sarah
Jessica Parker in Abu Dhabi

1101
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,006
in Sex and the City 2,

1102
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,674
a little bit Wonder Woman.

1103
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,043
I'm just shaking that chiffon
behind me,

1104
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,279
and then I just throw it.
Yes.

1105
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:03,614
[RuPaul] Oh, yes, honey.
Sell the garment.

1106
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,216
[Michelle] Eat it, Barney.

1107
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:08,419
[RuPaul] Ooh, purple rain,
purple train.

1108
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,121
[all laugh]

1109
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,023
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

1110
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:15,893
[Michelle] Anna Karenina
no she betta don't.

1111
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,062
[RuPaul] Oh, meet you
in Gorky Park.

1112
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,464
[Michelle laughs]

1113
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:21,599
[Shuga] I am giving you magic
on this runway.

1114
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,768
I'm feeling luxurious
in my faux fur.

1115
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:25,436
I'm ready to cuddle up
by the fire

1116
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,438
in this gorgeous caftan.

1117
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,907
And voila, it is spring, honey.

1118
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,843
I am feeling my fruit fantasy.

1119
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:34,178
She is blossoming
all over this runway.

1120
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,748
I'm showing you all the legs,
the sun's out.

1121
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,784
I'm ready to catch
these boys, honey.

1122
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,320
-Oh.
-Ooh.

1123
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,654
[Michelle]
Beach blanket bang-a-ho.

1124
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,990
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain,
now de-caftan-ated.

1125
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,259
[all laugh]

1126
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,794
[RuPaul] Nina West.

1127
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,196
Welcome to Caftanistan.

1128
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:53,498
[all laugh]

1129
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:55,967
[Ross] Bea Arthur?
More like A+ Arthur.

1130
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,368
-Yes.
-Yes.

1131
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,536
[Nina] I'm really
trying to sell

1132
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,938
the luxury of this lifestyle

1133
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:05,843
in my elegant Elizabeth Taylor
seventies caftan.

1134
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,245
I'm feeling loose and free,

1135
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,647
and I can feel the wind
go up my ass, which is amazing.

1136
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,382
I haven't felt that in weeks.

1137
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,317
This woman is a woman of means,

1138
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,987
and she's getting ready
for a busy day of sitting.

1139
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,222
[Michelle] Lady Bunny
never looked so good.

1140
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,625
[RuPaul] Mm. See you later
at the Regal Beagle.

1141
00:44:20,625 --> 00:44:22,026
[all laugh]

1142
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:23,561
[Michelle] Yes, Mrs. Groper.

1143
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:24,729
[all laugh]

1144
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:26,063
All of those references

1145
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,165
were too old
for everybody in this room.

1146
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,035
[RuPaul] Well, you're
educating children.

1147
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,405
Ladies,
welcome to Caftanistan.

1148
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,374
[all laugh]

1149
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:38,543
And now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

1150
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,782
Starting with the Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1151
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:46,250
When you came out,
it was such a statement,

1152
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,420
and I think it made all of us
kind of gasp a little bit.

1153
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,788
The eyelashes are crazy to me.

1154
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:52,089
It looks like they're
just in the middle.

1155
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,291
So like
if you're looking one way,

1156
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,059
it looks like you're
not even wearing a lash.

1157
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,495
You were great
in the magic show.

1158
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:59,063
You made me laugh over and over.

1159
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,965
The spins were giving me life.

1160
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,668
Your connection to the audience
and to everyone

1161
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:05,136
was really, really epic.

1162
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:07,205
Your personality was in it,
and that's what we eat up.

1163
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,473
But it seemed messy.

1164
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,076
Your jacket looked wrinkly.

1165
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:15,313
Your padding, you could see
the outlines of your hip pads.

1166
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,481
Like, girl, we saw everything.

1167
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,718
I recognize that I had
body issues in my padding.

1168
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,053
Like, I had people
trying to help me

1169
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,288
push them down and reshape them.

1170
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,423
And my body
just did not work today.

1171
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:26,624
Well, let me
just stop you there.

1172
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:27,959
I mean, there are things
you could have done.

1173
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:29,193
Mm-hmm.

1174
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,462
Throw on more tights
so it smooths it out.

1175
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,763
At this point
in the competition,

1176
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,098
we're splitting hairs.

1177
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:35,566
And these
are the kinds of things

1178
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,402
that could get a girl
put into the bottom two.

1179
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,206
Up next, Yvie Oddly.

1180
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,375
Tonight on the runway,
I absolutely love this.

1181
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,043
Givenchy. Very chic.

1182
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,146
[Michelle] Your performance
was kind of flat.

1183
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:53,851
There was a tenseness,
you know, at times.

1184
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:55,653
Even though
it sort of came across

1185
00:45:55,653 --> 00:46:00,491
that you were a little nervous,
you had really bold choices.

1186
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:01,559
From an actor's perspective,

1187
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:02,994
that's essential
in a performance.

1188
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:06,097
But it seemed to me
like you were thinking

1189
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:08,499
or like you weren't
enjoying yourself.

1190
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,068
I guess I was
a little bit stressed

1191
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,437
because like we had
to rewrite a lot of stuff.

1192
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,406
And in the kindest of ways
to the rest of my team,

1193
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:18,409
I'm the only one
who thinks that way.

1194
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,410
Thinks what way?

1195
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,748
Uh, in planning things out.

1196
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:24,949
My team was basically like,

1197
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,250
well, we work better
with improv,

1198
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,319
and it was very obvious

1199
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,055
that it didn't work
being improv-ed.

1200
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:35,993
So I wrote
most of our intro, our exit.

1201
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,962
If there was a place I was at,

1202
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,263
it was just, I guess,

1203
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,731
just trying to make sure
that all went right.

1204
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,800
All right.
Thank you, Yvie.

1205
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:48,439
Um, Mama, I did not do improv.

1206
00:46:48,439 --> 00:46:51,342
So I didn't write down
what I was going to say?

1207
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,577
I'm not saying you didn't write
down what you were going to say.

1208
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,079
You said the rest of us didn't.

1209
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,882
You guys didn't plan
as much as I did, girl.

1210
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,750
-That's the Tee.
-I did plan.

1211
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,353
I'm not gonna go through that.

1212
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:03,721
[Vanjie] I'm like, girl,

1213
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,322
how you gonna sit there
and say that to the judges

1214
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,524
knowing that's
the particular critique

1215
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,926
that has been given to me?

1216
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,696
[RuPaul] Up next,
A'Keria C. Davenport.

1217
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:14,465
I live in Palm Springs, so
I take caftans very seriously.

1218
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,466
Okay.

1219
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,668
[Ross] I love this outfit,

1220
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,203
but a caftan it is not.

1221
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,939
I'm sorry to get mad about it.

1222
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,441
[all laugh]

1223
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,143
Now wait. In my defense,
I Googled caftan.

1224
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:29,380
Now, there's a caftan with a C
and a kaftan with a K.

1225
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,915
And I saw some caftans
with pants.

1226
00:47:30,915 --> 00:47:31,982
Not in my religion.

1227
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,085
[all laugh]

1228
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:35,419
Your magic show was great.

1229
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:37,655
The only thing I would
have wanted to see more of

1230
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:38,989
was when you did your trick.

1231
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,425
The way that all four of you
were around,

1232
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:44,829
I would have loved to have seen
more hype from your teammates,

1233
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:47,098
because I think that would have
helped sell the moment more.

1234
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:49,633
[Ross] Your team struggled
a little bit.

1235
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,702
I was having a bad day at first,

1236
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,337
because there was
a lot going on, but...

1237
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:54,338
What was going on?

1238
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,706
Going into it,

1239
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,609
we all had the mindset
of the, you know, improv.

1240
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,846
At the last minute, some of the
decisions and the routes we went

1241
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:04,515
wasn't going to be suitable
for television.

1242
00:48:04,515 --> 00:48:05,516
[laughs]

1243
00:48:05,516 --> 00:48:06,917
So at the last minute,

1244
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,320
we did have
to rearrange some things.

1245
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,123
You cleaned up the magic act,

1246
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:15,326
and the deep throat balloon
stayed in?

1247
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:17,762
[all laugh]

1248
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,063
Was it--how dirty was it?

1249
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,798
Oh, girl, it was filthy.

1250
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,466
[all laugh]
But tasty, too.

1251
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,536
Up next, Vanjie.

1252
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:26,704
First and foremost,
I want to say

1253
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:28,906
this is my favorite caftan
up here tonight.

1254
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,741
-Aw.
-I would wear that caftan.

1255
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,511
Yeah, you look my titi Sepha,
my titi--

1256
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:36,814
Girl, I was already thinking
we look family, mama.

1257
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,315
Don't do it to me.
[all laugh]

1258
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,316
It's to die for.

1259
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,718
The challenge, though.

1260
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:42,853
I didn't really get much
from the performance,

1261
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,722
and when you did talk,
I was like there's Vanjie.

1262
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:46,357
Wait. Right.

1263
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:48,125
There's no character
development.

1264
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,126
Okay, yeah.

1265
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:50,694
I feel like we hit a wall.

1266
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,097
I did write down
what I wanted to say

1267
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,632
and what I was going to do.

1268
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:57,635
Like I've been trying
really hard to push myself.

1269
00:48:57,635 --> 00:49:00,271
Like whatever critiques
you guys say, I do listen.

1270
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,607
And, um, that's why
I went a different route

1271
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,076
with just writing it down
and stuff.

1272
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,511
That's not the problem.

1273
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:12,149
There's gotta be some kind
of elevation in performance.

1274
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,384
It's just at this level.

1275
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:16,487
You need to give us more
or else it's done.

1276
00:49:17,988 --> 00:49:19,490
Thank you, Vanjie.

1277
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,928
Up next, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1278
00:49:23,928 --> 00:49:26,130
Let's talk about
this runway look.

1279
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,233
I love it so much.
I wish I had a gold bra.

1280
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:30,634
[all laugh]

1281
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,436
I was really captivated
by the way that you walked.

1282
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:36,674
Whipping it around,
leg out, pose, turn.

1283
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,075
It was delicious.

1284
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,579
And that magic show
was phenomenal.

1285
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:42,780
Really, really funny.

1286
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,615
[Michelle] They were
realized characters,

1287
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,618
you had choreography,
which I'm attributing to you.

1288
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,988
I laughed the entire time.

1289
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,757
[ Katherine] And one of my notes
I wrote for you was,

1290
00:49:53,757 --> 00:49:54,825
baby, you're a star.

1291
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:55,826
Oh.

1292
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,562
[RuPaul] Up next, Shuga Cain.

1293
00:49:58,562 --> 00:50:00,531
You look absolutely
beautiful in this.

1294
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:02,032
It's Game of Thrones.

1295
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,269
Like, it's just giving me
queen everything.

1296
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:07,271
I wish you would have
kept this on.

1297
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:10,641
I felt like it got
progressively not as cute.

1298
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:15,212
In the magician's production,
you weren't bad,

1299
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,515
but you paled in comparison
next to two juggernauts.

1300
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,118
It was not quite good enough.

1301
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,655
[Ru] There was a point where
you had a few jokes to land,

1302
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,824
but you never quite landed
those jokes.

1303
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,126
You guys did a better job
than the other team.

1304
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:32,263
You always want to be
on the best team,

1305
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:35,099
but the risk
is being overshadowed.

1306
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,535
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

1307
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,571
Tonight on the runway,
it's exactly the caftan

1308
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:45,075
that I've been dreaming of
my entire life.

1309
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:48,679
I really enjoyed your
performance in The Mighty Tucks.

1310
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,014
Magic!

1311
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:53,884
The eighties shoulder pads,
the life was everything.

1312
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,619
Obviously
Brooke Lynn's a dancer,

1313
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,455
and you're back there cheesing
it up just as much as she is.

1314
00:50:58,455 --> 00:50:59,957
I was dying of laughter.

1315
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:03,961
You were, from the beginning
to the end, hysterical.

1316
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,829
[Katherine] Your energy
was so up,

1317
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,097
and your command of the stage

1318
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:09,099
and what you were doing
was great to watch.

1319
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,334
[Ross] It was so funny.

1320
00:51:10,334 --> 00:51:12,336
And you created
this other character.

1321
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:14,571
That's how you do it.
Thumbs up to you.

1322
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:18,542
[all laugh]

1323
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,610
[RuPaul] Thank you, ladies.

1324
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,945
I think we've heard enough.

1325
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,347
While you untuck backstage,

1326
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,349
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1327
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,886
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

1328
00:51:28,886 --> 00:51:32,790
I wanna know what you have
to say about my girls.

1329
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,292
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1330
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:36,727
She really kept the energy high,

1331
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:39,430
and her personality
definitely shone through.

1332
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,798
She was counting on her charm.

1333
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,232
Now, I bought it,

1334
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:44,068
but I couldn't get over looking
at how sloppy she looked.

1335
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,036
It really was messy.

1336
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:47,171
It just didn't work for me.

1337
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:49,473
You gotta come strong
all the time.

1338
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,774
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

1339
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,276
[Katherine] Yvie seemed
a little nervous to me

1340
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,111
on stage tonight
for the magic show.

1341
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,013
I felt like she was just
thinking about the words,

1342
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:58,682
getting it done, and then moving
to the side of the stage.

1343
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,618
If she was the one that wrote
something to open and close,

1344
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,853
then she could have been

1345
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,422
the only saving grace
in that performance.

1346
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,057
Didn't look like the other girls
thought it was true, though.

1347
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,326
Did you see Vanjie?
She was not having that.

1348
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,327
[Gina] Well, yeah,
there was disconnect

1349
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,462
definitely in that group,

1350
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,130
and you felt it
in the performance.

1351
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,199
[RuPaul] A'Keria C. Davenport.

1352
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:17,067
The team had a bit of
a tough time cohesively

1353
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,302
putting that performance
together,

1354
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,237
but I'd really like
to see more of her.

1355
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,539
Tonight on the runway,
it's a caftan challenge,

1356
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:24,074
and there's nary a caftan
to be found.

1357
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,543
You know, some of these caftans
were so good

1358
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:27,644
they were making me pant.

1359
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,380
Like...[pants]

1360
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,749
But A'Keria
was making me...pant?

1361
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,317
[laughs]

1362
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,852
I don't know if I've ever been
this mad in my entire life.

1363
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,520
[all laugh]

1364
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,756
Caftan it was not.

1365
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,391
Let it go, Ru.

1366
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:43,160
[all laugh]

1367
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,162
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1368
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,131
This has been week
after week after week

1369
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:48,766
where we're trying
to get character development,

1370
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,167
and we're not.

1371
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,869
[Katherine] Her personality
is definitely something

1372
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:53,270
that is really magnetic.

1373
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,073
[Ross] I just find her so
interesting and so funny.

1374
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,742
But I don't disagree
that at a certain point

1375
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,912
you've gotta bring more
than just one gear.

1376
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,080
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1377
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,249
She's been great
in this competition.

1378
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:07,551
I feel very attacked right now!

1379
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:11,522
And nobody owned the runway
like she did tonight.

1380
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,858
The dance background she has
has really come in handy.

1381
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,460
[Gina]
Brooke Lynn is a star.

1382
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,128
Not just kind of, sort of.

1383
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,630
She is a star.

1384
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,864
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

1385
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,433
Shuga gave me comedy blue balls.

1386
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,501
You know, when it came time
for her punchline,

1387
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,036
I was right there ready for it.

1388
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,337
