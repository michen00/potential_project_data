[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:05,766
You'll be performing
in your very own magic show.

3
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,568
[cheers]

4
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,436
Aah!

5
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,004
Wow.

6
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,973
I said ain't nothing--
no ketchup in here, baby.

7
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,642
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

8
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,878
You never quite landed
those jokes.

9
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,013
-Oh.
-Vanjie.

10
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,616
You need to give us more
or else it's done.

11
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,884
[RuPaul] Nina West.

12
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,053
Your energy was so up,
it was great to watch.

13
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,255
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

14
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,324
[applause]

15
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:33,126
Vanjie, shantay, you stay.

16
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,396
Shuga Cain, sashay away.

17
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,242
Vroom.

18
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,277
I'm a unicorn.

19
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,012
It's a rhino, mama.

20
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,714
Wait a minute.
Did you call me a rhino?

21
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,115
[all laugh]

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,384
So Shuga's gone,

23
00:01:57,384 --> 00:02:01,221
and I'm definitely saddened,
because Shuga's very talented

24
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,723
and she's a sweetheart
through and through.

25
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,326
"You all hold a very
special place in my heart.

26
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,662
Make Nana proud. Shuga."

27
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,197
We love you, Shug.

28
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,065
I'm still shook
from the lip sync.

29
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,568
Child, I'm just, whoo.

30
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,671
Baby, when I tell you all
the words was speaking to me,

31
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:21,108
I was just making sure they knew
Miss Thing is out of the drama.

32
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,076
All right, you lip synced twice.

33
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,079
No more, Mary.

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,614
Wake up and smell the coffee.

35
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,883
You get a new opportunity.
Don't take it for granted.

36
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,985
[A'Keria]
So, Silk, how you feeling?

37
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,588
'Cause I know like tonight
was one of those nights

38
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,690
where they really added
some pressure on your back.

39
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,692
Like, you almost was
gonna have to lip sync.

40
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:39,693
[Silky] I guess that's
what I have to work on

41
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,495
in this competition, right.

42
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,431
Did I do everything I
could have done in that moment?

43
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,867
But it's like I kinda
accepted the defeat.

44
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,435
And that's what
I'm kinda disappointed

45
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,870
in myself in right now.

46
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,607
Because, like, I'm a girl
that will fight to the very end.

47
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,810
After last week's
roach critique

48
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,213
and this week's body critique,
I'm completely embarrassed,

49
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,149
my pride is bruised,

50
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,750
and it makes me feel like

51
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,253
I'm getting worse and worse
in this competition.

52
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:10,157
But, bitch, I cannot fold and
crack under this damn pressure.

53
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,558
I just can't give up.

54
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,026
[Brooke Lynn]
Nina, congrats.

55
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,529
Oh, I feel fucking great.

56
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,731
I feel so good.

57
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,100
And I had a lot of fun
in this challenge.

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,536
I just want to soak up this win.

59
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,571
But I am not resting.

60
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:28,341
I have to bring everything
that's Nina and kill it.

61
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,976
Because everyone
who is here right now

62
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,978
is absolutely gunning
for top four.

63
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,382
And we've seen really
shocking things happen before.

64
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,650
No one is safe.

65
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,018
It's anybody's game
at this point.

66
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,286
Oh, my God, ow.

67
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,387
Bitches better
step our pussies up.

68

[RuPaul] Ooh, girl.

92
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,680
She done already
done had herses.

93
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,418
My queens, as my play cousin
June Bug used to say,

94
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,724
sometimes the past can come back
and bite you in the ass.

95

So if you want to be
America's next drag superstar,

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,430
I sure hope you got
some extra padding, okurr?

98
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,069

somebody from the past.

Hello, hello, hello.

[cheers]

101
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,244
Ladies, if I could pass on
just one life lesson

102
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,079
to each and every
single one of you,

103
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,383
when the going gets tough,
the tough gotta know

104
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:20,220
when it's time to fake
bitch-slap a mother tucker.

105
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,389
Yes!

106
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,425
So for today's mini challenge,

107
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,561
I'm bringing back
a little game we call

108
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,130
[imitates Cher]
Slap Out Of It.

109
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,399
[all laugh]

110
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,968
But since I'm still
in litigation

111
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:39,172
over allegedly slapping
a queen last season...

112
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,840
[all laugh]

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,542
You'll be fake-slapping
each other.

114
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,211
-Oh.
-Oh.

115
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,012
[RuPaul] This is how it works.

116
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,481
You come up
with some sassy lines

117
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,984
that inspires
your fellow queens

118
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,053
to fake-slap
the crap out of you.

119
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,554
And in the end,

120
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:58,091
the queen with the most
compelling reactions wins.

121
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,759
[cheers and applause]
All right, then.

122
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,061
I got this one.

123
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,462
First up, Nina West.

124
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,297
Assume the position.

125
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,567
All right, Dr. Ganache,
your patient is here.

126
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,803
[all laugh]

127
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,138
You big old chaperone-looking

128
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:15,175
grilled cheese
motherfucker, you.

129
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,409
I love grilled cheese.

130
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,844
I bet. Aah!

[all laugh]

132
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,515
You wanna hit people
with trash cans?

133
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,950
What?

134
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,020
You bot spiderville
beetle-looking motherfucker.

135
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,190
Aah!

136
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,359
[all laugh]

137
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,327
Beep, beep, beep.

138
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,562
I actually want you
to do something.

139
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,630
All right. You got it.

140
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,664
Get the hell
out of Brooke's ass.

141
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,665
That's Vanjie's position now.

142
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,066
Oh.

143
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,568
The shade.

144
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,702
Aah!

145
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,504
Ooh!

146
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,605
This is fun.

147
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,440
[all laugh]

148
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,377
I just know how easy
this all is for you,

149
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,279
since you only got
the same fucking character

150
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,613
every time she--

151
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,515
So do you. You always play
an ugly Naomi Smalls.

152
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,250
Aah!

153
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,719
Wrong week, ho.
Wrong week.

154
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,255
Can I get some baby powder?

155
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,556
Hold on.

156
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:06,293
I've been waiting to slap
your ass since week two.

157
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,662
-Aah!
-Oh, my goodness.

158
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,196
[groans]

159
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,932
It's so nice that you finally
gave Miss Celia her hair back.

160
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,603
I told you this bitch
wouldn't say it.

161
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,804
No, Ru, it's okay.

162
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,173
I'm gonna lead with love.

163
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,342
Oh, you feel
just like a water bed.

164
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,443
[all laugh]

165
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,145
Aah!

166
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,746
I think I speak for everybody

167
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:31,017
and really say that we all love
hearing your opinion.

168
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,320
Good, 'cause I've got plenty
where it came from.

169
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,555
Aah! Aah!

170
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,690
There's one you can take home.

171
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,191
I love your head.

172
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,927
It reminds me of my testicles
after two hours in the bath.

173
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,295
Oh, bitch.

174
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,798
Well, I'll give you a few hours
to soak into that.

175
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,603
Your makeup looks like
a kindergarten art project.

176
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:52,939
Aah!

177
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,108
[all laugh]

178
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,344
Are you skeered?

179
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,611
I wanted to talk
about her toupee

180
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,880
and how she ain't got
no edges to mesh.

181
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,816
-I ain't got no edges?
-Mm-mm.

182
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,318
That's 'cause all of your--

183
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,588
-[laughs]
-Honey, oh, no.

184
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,923
Oh, bitch,
we taking something off--

185
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,391
Oh, bitch,
I ain't scared of you

186
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,326
or that little brillo pad
you got in your hand.

187
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,528
You're still ugly as hell.

188
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,529
Oh, shit.

189
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,098
You made
your whole country proud

190
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,400
by completely terrorizing
Celine Dion.

191
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,801
How's that make you feel?

192
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,571
[both laugh]

193
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,706
Oh!

194
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,007
Everything's
a little easier in Canada.

195
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,209
That's what I'm feeling
right now.

196
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,210
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

197
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,378
What you got, bitch?

198
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,780
I'm gonna show you
a dancer's slap.

199
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,382
[all laugh]

200
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:38,485
Keep spinning, bitch,
right out of the competition.

201
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:42,489
I don't know a whole lot about
Canada or the people in it,

202
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,657
but judging by your
Snatch Game, neither do you.

203
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,627
Ohh.
[all laugh]

204
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,795
This feels wrong.

205
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,863
Am I allowed
to slap a homeless person?

206
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,665
-I think it's okay.
-Thank you.

207
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,067
Oh!

208
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,935
She slapped
the fuck out of you.

209
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,570
I think you broke my jaw.

210
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,671
[laughs]

211
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,873
Game over.

212
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,009
All right.
Y'all some slap-happy queens.

213
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,744
[all laugh]

214
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:09,315
But one of you served
some major drama, mama.

215
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,316
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

216
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,285
Con-drag-ulations.

217
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:17,357
You've won nails and lashes
from Kiss USA

218
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:22,762
and a wig and styling package
from luxelab.

219
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:23,763
Amazing.

220
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,998
Glue not included.

221
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,767
[all laugh]

222
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,170
Ladies, you've all come so far.

223
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,038
But it's lonely at the top,

224
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,842
so I've arranged
a playdate for you

225
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:39,045
with some of my favorite queens.

226
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,381
[laughs]

227
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,582
Are you intrigued?

228
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,917
-Yes.
-Yes.

229
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,586
[imitates Jerry Lewis]
Hey, ladies!

230
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,924
[cheers and applause]

231
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,796
What the fuck?

232
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,099
I really feel bamboozled.

233
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:03,536
Done brought all these old
stale-edge dry-ass bitches back

234
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,405
with bad mugs and beards.

235
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,639
Like literally beards.

236
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,042
What are y'all doing here?

237
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,176
Aah!

238
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,244
Hey, cyst.

239
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,679
We're back, back, back.

240
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,681
Bitch, hold the fuck up.

241
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,816
Why they brought
these bitches back?

242
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,118
I don't like games.

243
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,020
I don't play Uno, checkers,
fucking Monopoly.

244
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,522
I don't know what's going on.

245
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,757
Last time they brought other
girls that were eliminated in,

246
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,793
it ended up scaring Vanjie.

247
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,762
I worry and I pray

248
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,599
that they're not gonna replace
some of us with some of them.

249
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,738
Ladies, welcome back
the eliminated queens:

250
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:44,577
Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara,
Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace.

251
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,778
Yes.

252
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,014
-Honey Davenport.
-What's good?

253
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,282
Oh.

254
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,050
And Soju.

255
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,019
This is crazy.

256
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,420
Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

257
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,890
you need to make over
one of the returning queens

258
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:02,161
and transform her into a member
of your own drag family.

259
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,396
#DragRace.

260
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,634
Now, to my top six queens,
let me be clear.

261
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:11,604
This is your challenge
to win or lose.

262
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:15,175
The returning queens
are here for a makeover only.

263
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:19,479
They will not be returning
to the competition.

264
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:23,383
In fact, during crucial moments
of the makeover,

265
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,586
they'll have to wear
these stylish pink mittens

266
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:30,089
to assure all the work is yours.

267
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,391
May God help us.

268
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,126
[all laugh]

269
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,695
Now, Brooke Lynn,
you won the mini challenge,

270
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:39,032
so you get to pair up
the queens.

271
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,636
So first, who do you pick
for yourself?

272
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,138
I'm going to pick Plastique.

273
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:46,472
Yay.

274
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,141
[A'Keria]
I'm definitely not surprised

275
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,677
that Brooke picked Plastique,

276
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,146
because, I mean,
it's an easy makeover.

277
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,714
Plastique's an easy canvas.

278
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,383
Which queen
do you pick for Nina?

279
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,086
I'm gonna say Shuga Cain.

280
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,322
Wha!

281
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,257
[both laugh]

282
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,858
Which queen do you pick
for Yvie?

283
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,895
I'm going to say Scarlet.

284
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,563
-Come ova.
-Hi.

285
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,099
My chemistry lady.

286
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,235
Which queen do you choose
for A'Keria?

287
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,236
Honey.

288
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,172
-What's up?
-Hey, cousin.

289
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,941
That's right,
Davenports in the house.

290
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,478
It seems like Brooke Lynn
is trying to pair everybody up

291
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:29,616
with somebody that she thinks
would physically work out

292
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,684
or, you know, just have
a chemistry together.

293
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,519
And who do you pick for Silky?

294
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,754
Soju.

295
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,558
[A'Keria] But Silky and Soju?

296
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,593
Chicago queens.

297
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,295
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

298
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:44,831
Mama plays
a very strategic game.

299
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,833
This might work out for you,
Brooke.

300
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,502
[Brooke Lynn]
What is your face?

301
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,970
I'm smiling.

302
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,171
[all laugh]

303
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,673
[Soju]
You're not happy to see me?

304
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,742
I'm really happy
to see you, girl.

305
00:12:55,742 --> 00:13:00,346
Bitch, that quiet-ass,
shady-ass Brooke Lynn,

306
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,517
that bitch put me with Soju,
the bitch that went home first,

307
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,154
the bitch that came in week one
looking like Ronald McDonald.

308
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,857
You ain't gave me
shit to work with.

309
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,860
Obviously Brooke Lynn sees me
as a top competitor for her,

310
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,528
so that bitch trying
to get me out of here.

311
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,499
[RuPaul] That means Vanjie
will get Ariel Versace.

312
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,834
Just as I cyst-pected.

313
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,238
Yay!
[all laugh]

314
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,874
[RuPaul] Now, ladies,
to help you create

315
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,909
a strong family resemblance,

316
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,980
you can use materials
from the F&S Fabrics wall,

317
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,682
Fierce! Drag Jewels,

318
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,419
Rock Star Wigs,
and your own drags.

319
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,921
Ooh, this is gonna be fun.

320
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:46,492
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

321
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,963
Girl, I'm not gonna lie.

322
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,231
I'm happy I got you.

323
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,533
Well, yeah, hello.

324
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,934
How are you holding up?

325
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,636
Listen, the last few weeks
has been a fight.

326
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,404
It's getting down to the wire.
It's just a few of you.

327
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,806
Yeah. It's stressful.

328
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,108
If you have one stray hair
flying the wrong the way,

329
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,576
it could be the reason,
you know--

330
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:06,379
Speaking of hair,
I hear some of my hair's gone.

331
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,481
Right, what happened?

332
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,450
Girl, I just left it
by accident.

333
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,453
In the midst of things,
when I was eliminated,

334
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:15,455
I was like super, like,
emotional packing everything,

335
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:19,092
and I literally forgot
I had an entire rack of my wigs.

336
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,093
My wigs are like my babies.

337
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:21,427
And then when I got back home,

338
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,864
I realized, oh, my God,
I left a bunch of wigs.

339
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,899
They all thought you left hair
for real for them.

340
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,901
I left that red one for Silky,

341
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,638
and other than that,
those were all just by accident.

342
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,639
Yeah.

343
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,708
So I'm sure that's going to be--

344
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,176
There's been some drama
about the hair.

345
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,711
What happened with the hair?

346
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,846
People were fighting over it.

347
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:40,947
Are they all gone?

348
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,381
Yeah. I don't know
where they are.

349
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,183
Yeah.

350
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:47,353
So I guess some of these queens

351
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,655
thought that I left these wigs
behind for them.

352
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,058
I love that they all flock
to them like flies on shit,

353
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,292
but I want to know

354
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,861
who the hell's
snatching up my damn wigs.

355
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,063
So, Lucy, they got
some 'splaining to do.

356
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:00,566
Well, it could be Bad Girls Club
Season 11, hello.

357
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,437
Child, I need Ariel
to focus on the challenge,

358
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,605
'cause I need a win.

359
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,406
That's mine.
That's definitely mine.

360
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,842
[Vanjie] She's looking
for her tumbleweeds

361
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,612
that done went into
somebody else's station,

362
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,280
and she's freaking
the fuck out.

363
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,249
Aah, Lord, can I catch a break?

364
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,618
Well, the Jersey
will come out. Hello.

365
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,286
Oh, my God.

366
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,856
[Shuga] Ariel, she's been
waiting to stir the pot.

367
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:26,859
Get ready, honey.
It's about to blow up.

368
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,496
I love that.

369
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,167
This week's maxi challenge
is makeover time.

370
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,670
We have to do one of these
eliminated girls

371
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,971
in our drag style.

372
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,107
Who this man, miss ?

373
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,875
This is a full-on
dick magnet, honey.

374
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,177
[A'Keria] Oh. [laughs]

375
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,579
So I've got a really strong
concept for this.

376
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,014
Okay.

377
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,049
We're going to be actually
from the same denim tribe.

378
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,217
Okay.

379
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,553
I like the idea
of tribes and villages

380
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,955
more than I do
a traditional drag family.

381
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,057
It takes a village
to raise a queen.

382
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,158
A lot of the other girls

383
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,393
are going to serve
super-high glamour.

384
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:01,828
Uh-huh.

385
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,429
And even though I know you love
some super-high glamour--

386
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,964
I do love my glamour.

387
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,066
You're now going
to tap into the Odd-sizers.

388
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,167
Yeah, I can get weird.

389
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,169
These looks say
the House of Oddly

390
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,373
in the way that they are
deconstructing a material.

391
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,575
[Scarlet] Gorg.

392
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,809
[Yvie]
I love the beauty of things

393
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,779
that look like they're
just falling off of you.

394
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,147
But the danger is

395
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,884
I'm really just going to have
to fine-tune everything.

396
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,488
Yes, something magical.

397
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,457
-Yeah?
-Oh, ma'am, yeah.

398
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,992
That's the Tee.

399
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,861
[all laugh]

400
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,762
Oh, my gosh.

401
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,763
Jesus.

402
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:41,133
She's back in the workroom.

403
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,703
That's for sure.

404
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,238
[Vanjie]
Hide your mirrors, girls.

405
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,307
What the fuck is that?

406
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,176
A winning look.

407
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,944
[Shuga]
Yes, bitch, you betta.

408
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,949
Yvie is, in her own odd way,
very high fashion.

409
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,886
I'm very confident
in what Yvie and I

410
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,854
are going to bring
as fashion girls.

411
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,089
Yvie and I
are going to take this.

412
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,591
Somebody give her a mirror,
darling.

413
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,793
Yeah, it ain't working for me.

414
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,464
But nice.
E for effort.

415
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,968
I don't want you
to look like half-assed.

416
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,937
I'd rather
you look the prettiest.

417
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,272
I just need to excel,

418
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,774
because I just came
fresh off the bottom again,

419
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,677
and haven't had this wow moment
since the talk show,

420
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,046
where the judges are like,
Miss Vanjie is here.

421
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,714
And I want that
more than anything.

422
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:32,285
I have to take it in from
the bottom to bring it up.

423
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,153
Why don't you just put it
on the mannequin form?

424
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,288
[Vanjie]
Because it's already darted,

425
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,223
but I need to bring it in more.

426
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,491
So I'm tailoring it to her body.

427
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,326
I'm sewing it and making sure

428
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:42,194
I make this dress
fit her like a glove.

429
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,462
I want to make sure I do good,

430
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,698
'cause I'm listening,
believe it or not.

431
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,899
Oh, it fits you way better.

432
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,671
Oh, you brought my doughnuts.

433
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,105
Oh, yeah, I got them.

434
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,942
You know, I used these
to sit down when I had my cyst.

435
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:59,045
I was like
I could not sit on the hard,

436
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,148
so I sat like this
because it was hurting so bad.

437
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,718
What's the first thing
this bitch wanna talk about?

438
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,286
Her goddamn cyst.

439
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,555
I have a cyst.

440
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,823
I'm currently oozing.

441
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,695
Why did you bring it up
on the runway?

442
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:18,431
Well, the judges were like
you're having a hard time.

443
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,967
And I was like, yeah, I kinda
am having a hard time.

444
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,202
Like, I'm literally leaking
as we're speaking.

445
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,442
Now, another thing
is I don't wear big shoes,

446
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,444
because I have tendonitis
so I can't wear high heels.

447
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,212
[Silky] What kind of heels
you be wearing?

448
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:36,849
I wear those, um,
basic grandma heels.

449
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,485
But, you know, I just
call them sensible heels.

450
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,888
If my tendonitis are really
really bad, then I wear flats.

451
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:46,359
Child, now she's talking about
she's got tendonitis.

452
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:49,762
The motherfucking challenge
is to put a drag queen--

453
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:52,565
excuse me--
an experienced drag queen

454
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,266
in motherfucking drag.

455
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,569
Why do I feel like I'm about
to put somebody in drag

456
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,604
for the first motherfucking time
in their life?

457
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,573
I'm gonna see
if we can get a pair of shoes

458
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,707
from this wall, honey.

459
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,776
I mean, I can try it.

460
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,878
You gonna learn today, honey,
because I ain't going home.

461
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,147
You're gonna learn
how to walk in heels today.

462
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,784
Oh, my God, I've never worn
heels like this high.

463
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:14,854
Oh, no.

464
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17,957
Oh, my goodness.

465
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,159
Bitch, oh, hell--
Go back. Uh-uh.

466
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,094
You're walking like this, honey.

467
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,163
[Vanjie] Girl,
she had on jelly slippers

468
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,698
when she was on the runway.

469
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,400
Aah. Call me out.

470
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,101
Nobody could see them.

471
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,904
I could not believe
you had on jelly slippers.

472
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,539
[laughs]

473
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,341
She looks like a Teletubby

474
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,878
trying to strut
for the first time.

475
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,480
I can't walk
in heels like these.

476
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,382
[Vanjie] Wait, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

477
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,717
What heels
do you walk in, then?

478
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,020
I walk in like very small heels.

479
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,256
[Vanjie] Oh, my God.

480
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,727
There is no words
to describe the gag that I'm--

481
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,695
I'm at a state--
I've never been this gagged.

482
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,297
Girl!

483
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,132
And I thought
it was going to be halfway easy

484
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,601
because we're making over drag
queens that already do this.

485
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,970
How you gonna come
on Drag Race and not--

486
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,807
and they weren't like--
they weren't like stilettos.

487
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,209
They were like
a regular six-inch heel.

488
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,478
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
[laughs]

489
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,479
Oh.

490
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,214
Yes.

491
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,282
Listen, that walk.

492
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,451
[laughs]

493
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,620
Can we be like, you know,
like street?

494
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,755
[Silky]
Bitch, get your baby shoes.

495
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,890
Let's see
what you can do in those.

496
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,193
Yeah, girl, this is a setup.

497
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,698
Hey, twisted sisters.

498
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,699
-Hey!
-Hey!

499
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,801
It's a family reunion.

500
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,603
[cheers]

501
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,405
Question. Who brought
the potato salad?

502
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,373
-Oh.
-Okay, good.

503
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,811
The Davenports
are in the house.

504
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,480
How are you related?
You're Texas, you're New York.

505
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,349
Yes. Sahara Davenport
and Asia Davenport

506
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,750
both left
and moved to New York City,

507
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,119
which is how
I became a Davenport.

508
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,154
Well, how different
are the New York Davenports

509
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,655
from the Texas Davenports?

510
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,090
[Honey]
It's completely different.

511
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,559
It's definitely like more
of a pageant-y, pageant-y town.

512
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,128
New York, like,
while we have pageants,

513
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:06,165
it's more of a like fashion,
you know, kind of vibe.

514
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,967
She don't know nothing
about that Texas drag just yet.

515
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,603
I've gonna give her
a little A'Keria feel.

516
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,872
-Yeah.
-That Chanel La Bella feel.

517
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,840
Okay. This is
another design challenge.

518
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,042
Your last design challenge
was not good for you.

519
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,177
It was not.

520
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,446
Of course,
I've got to redeem myself.

521
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,381
I just want to make sure
that I embody

522
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,949
what it is
that I have to do this time,

523
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,253
because I want to make sure
Honey is a replica of A'Keria.

524
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:29,021
[RuPaul] Who do you think's
in trouble here?

525
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,923
Who do you think
is going to have a hard time

526
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,426
relaying their
family resemblance?

527
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,128
I'd probably have to say Silky.

528
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,664
I would say hers
would probably be a challenge,

529
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,899
because I know Soju

530
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,467
really doesn't walk in heels,
number one.

531
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:44,336
And also, I've never saw Silky
paint anybody else,

532
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,905
and, you know,
mama kind of blind.

533
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,606
[all laugh]

534
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,009
Well, listen, I can't wait
to see the Davenports

535
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,210
hit the runway.

536
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,878
Good luck,
and we'll see you out there.

537
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,547
-Thank you.
-All right.

538
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:57,149
Brooke Lynn and Plastique.

539
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,484
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi, Ru.

540
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,718
Why'd you pick Plastique?

541
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:01,787
Well, my walk on the runway
is something

542
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,556
that's very important to me
and my aesthetic.

543
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:05,090
And I knew she has a great walk,

544
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,127
and she's around my height
and around my build,

545
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,995
so I knew costuming
would be a lot easier.

546
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,064
What is the family aesthetic?

547
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,399
[Brooke Lynn]
We are pageant queens.

548
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,601
The walk, the look,
the elegance, the poise.

549
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:16,836
Mm-hmm.

550
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,837
That's a huge part
of my family aesthetic.

551
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,239
[RuPaul] Now, Brooke Lynn,

552
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:22,875
did you have a strategy
in pairing the other girls?

553
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,310
[Brooke Lynn] Not really.

554
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,347
I was really looking at
the girls who had just come in

555
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,682
and the girls
who were still here,

556
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,483
and kind of seeing
who would work well together.

557
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,852
Really, bitch?
I mean, Soju and Silky?

558
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,222
[laughs] Well...

559
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,025
What you mean to say
is, yeah, I'm a shady bitch.

560
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,293
[laughs] I'm not.

561
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,462
Honest, like,
Silky's a wonderful performer,

562
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:45,464
but I think in terms of looks,

563
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,632
I think putting her
with anybody,

564
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,600
it would have been
a bit of a struggle.

565
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,570
I'm a nice person.

566
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,705
[RuPaul] All right.

567
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,173
Well, give one for Toronto.

568
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,641
-Thank you, Ru.
-Thanks.

569
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,312
Silky and Soju.

570
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,580
-Hi, Ru.
-Hey, baby.

571
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,815
[RuPaul] Both from Chicago.

572
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,384
Now, Silky, you won
two challenges so far.

573
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,719
How are you going
to make a third?

574
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,721
Ganache girls,
we are a look queen

575
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,055
that moves around, honey.

576
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,357
Okay.

577
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,558
So I'm going to go
to what I love and enjoy,

578
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,592
and that's disco.

579
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:14,593
Ooh.

580
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:15,861
We're gonna be two disco queens,

581
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,197
and give, like,
our personality, our charm.

582
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:21,133
I love that.
Now, last week, you were read

583
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,602
because your padding
was visible.

584
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,272
There were
several many complaints

585
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,473
from the judges' table.

586
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:28,941
I know.

587
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,342
[Michelle]
Your jacket looked wrinkly.

588
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,211
You could see the outlines
of your hip pads.

589
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,179
Like, girl, we saw everything.

590
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,749
How you gonna avoid
that same mistake?

591
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,717
Um...

592
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:40,119
The first thing I did
this morning

593
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,221
was went to my pads
and I prayed.

594
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:44,556
And I said, you're gonna work
for me this time, honey.

595
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:46,892
Well, the pads worked.

596
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:49,295
It was just that you
didn't have enough leggings on

597
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,597
to covers up the ridges.

598
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:55,200
I, um, still got to figure
that out, honey.

599
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,269
I've been doing it in--

600
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,238
It's not rocket science,
is it?

601
00:23:59,238 --> 00:24:00,472
I mean,
everybody wears pads.

602
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:01,840
[Silky] Right.

603
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,310
And we just wear enough tights
to smooth it out.

604
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,011
-Okay.
-Uh, this--

605
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,279
I got more pads.

606
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,349
Okay, so in hindsight,
the mistake was what?

607
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,151
My pads needed work,

608
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:15,454
and whether that's gonna be
to add more layers on

609
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,491
or to see if my pads inside
the thing was like just bumpy.

610
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,859
It's a lot of things--

611
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:24,396
Bitch, we could literally
see your pads on the runway.

612
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,898
I know!

613
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:29,068
And that was the first time
you have in this competition.

614
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,169
I--

615
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,005
You have no answer for me?
Really?

616
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,239
Girl, let me tell you.

617
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,443
This whole situation
got me like frazzled.

618
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,845
Like it just don't
come to words.

619
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:45,284
In the great words
of a wonderful singer...

620
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,119
What singer?
Who are you gonna quote?

621
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,354
[Silky] Girl,
I had the guy so frazzled,

622
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:51,056
I couldn't even
get the lyrics out.

623
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,191
[all laugh]

624
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,693
In the fabulous words
of Bruno Mars,

625
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,729
"Don't believe me, just watch."

626
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,731
Huh.

627
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,233
Now, Brooke Lynn
paired you with Soju.

628
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,601
Do you think she's being shady?

629
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,902
Do you think
she was helping you out?

630
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,872
Um, you know what?

631
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,541
I am very glad
that she put me with Soju,

632
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,176
'cause I think
we both need redemption.

633
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,146
Redemption from week one,
redemption for my pads.

634
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,881
Yeah, yeah.

635
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,150
Y'all know I'm a church lady
and a pageant queen,

636
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:21,887
but, bitch, the true Tee is,
Miss Brooke Lynn,

637
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,922
you done gave me
motherfucking Soju,

638
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,225
the bitch
that can't walk in heels,

639
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,527
still talking about
her motherfucking cyst,

640
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,497
when you know I'm gonna
struggle bust my damn self.

641
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:32,931
She done set me up.

642
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,466
All right. So I can't wait
to see you out there.

643
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,235
Strong family resemblance.

644
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,836
-Get it, girls.
-Yeah.

645
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,171
-All right, see you later.
-Thank you, Ru.

646
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,208
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi, Ru.

647
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,209
-Hi, Shuga.
-Hi, Ru.

648
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,911
It seems like only yesterday.

649
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,912
-Right?
-That you were here.

650
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,180
I was saying the same thing.

651
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,316
Nina, you won
the challenge last week.

652
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,851
How are you going
to keep that momentum going?

653
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,622
I'm just going
to continue to bring me,

654
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:58,424
and what a great challenge
to bring me to, right,

655
00:25:58,424 --> 00:25:59,658
as the House of.

656
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,959
Yeah. This is something
you do a lot of,

657
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,962
You have 17 children
in your house?

658
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,130
-House of West, yeah.
-House of West.

659
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,565
My drag mother's Virginia West,

660
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,200
and I have a bunch of daughters.

661
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,770
What is the sort of creed
of the House of West

662
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,772
that we'll see
on the main stage?

663
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:16,041
Yeah, our drag family
is really charitable,

664
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,210
and we're activists,
and that's the one thing

665
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,112
that I'm really holding true to
in this challenge.

666
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,047
So I see a rainbow dress there.

667
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,315
Like the rainbow flag.

668
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,416
The drag flag,
and then the trans flag.

669
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,351
I really believe
in lifting people up,

670
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,420
and I really believe
in celebrating all of us,

671
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,955
because the second
one of us is pulled down,

672
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:32,024
we're all pulled down.
-Oh, I love it.

673
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,992
So can I see your outfit?
Let's see what you got there.

674
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,395
So mine is a corset,
some shorts,

675
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,030
and some fabulous boot covers.

676
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,032
This is a little cute bodysuit
with the flag.

677
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,268
Let me see.
It's got the transgender flag.

678
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,404
And then it has
the boot covers as well.

679
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:47,573
And this is really reflective
of kind of who we are.

680
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,908
We're showgirls, and I'm
constantly inspired by theater.

681
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:52,211
This is like kind of a wink
to Kinky Boots,

682
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:55,247
but still something that's
very familiar to my world.

683
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,150
All right. Well, I can't wait
to see y'all on the runway.

684
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,718
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

685
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,689
I love the message,

686
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,625
but do I feel like
they look circus-y?

687
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,560
Mm.

688
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,964
Are they cute? Mm-mm.

689
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:20,339
[Soju] Your padding's
going to have to look right.

690
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,642
Oh, girl, trust me.
I'm gonna prove a point, honey.

691
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,110
That's one thing it will be:
right, honey.

692
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,213
[Soju] Is it true
that you paint with sharpies?

693
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,349
[Silky] I do my eyebrows
with a sharpie.

694
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,984
Are you going to do my eyebrows
with a sharpie?

695
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,586
[Silky] Yeah, sure.
Family resemblance, ho.

696
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,823
[all laugh]

697
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,559
You know, not every family
look the same.

698
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,261
[laughs]

699
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,196
Miss Soju, bitch, now
you ain't been here to know.

700
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,564
I done won a few challenges

701
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:47,366
and I got a lot of compliments
about my makeup.

702
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:49,768
So that's one thing that
you ain't got to worry about.

703
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,803
-I use my natural brows.
-I know.

704
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:53,071
You gonna get
a little sharpie on them.

705
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:54,406
-Okay.
-[laughs]

706
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,941
[Vanjie] You better
count your blessings

707
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,643
and hope that Silky don't put
no sharpie on your lips, too,

708
00:27:57,643 --> 00:27:59,044
'cause you know
she do that, too.

709
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,345
[Soju] You do not put sharpie
on your lips.

710
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,446
[Vanjie] Yes, girl,
yes, ma'am, honey.

711
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,849
Wait. Does it erase
off your lips?

712
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,384
Do I got it on my lips now?

713
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:06,785
Do you do it every time?

714
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,086
Every time.

715
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,121
[laughs]

716
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,589
Every time.

717
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:12,291
And she's saying
like it ain't nothing.

718
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,859
Like, yes, girl, what you mean?

719
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,360
Like, girl,
you offended her, eh?

720
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,728
Good God.

721
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:20,532
How dare you, Miss Soju,
question my skills

722
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,700
because I use
a permanent marker?

723
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,735
I can beat a mug.

724
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,306
Even when I'm at home, bitch,
I make some ho's beautiful.

725
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:31,209
I mean, like, ho's that look
like Wesley Snipes,

726
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,579
like John C. Reilly,

727
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:35,347
ho's that look like Lil Wayne,

728
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,016
and I make them ho's
look beautiful.

729
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,219
It's an honor that I put
makeup on your face any day.

730
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,487
[Vanjie]
Girl, you're gonna have

731
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,922
a lot of cyst-tivity going on?

732
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,357
[all laugh]

733
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:48,026
All I'm gonna say is, bitch,
take care of you.

734
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:49,461
You come first, cyst.

735
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,063
[all laugh]

736
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,734
Question.
When you walked in the room,

737
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,970
is there anyone that you were
surprised was still here?

738
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,971
Silky.

739
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,339
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

740
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,140
Her personality is good enough
to get on the show,

741
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,277
but I think that she's honestly
just in over her head.

742
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,379
[Nina] Anyone else
you were surprised by?

743
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,282
Vanjie, kind of.

744
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:13,151
I mean, when Michelle told her

745
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,954
"I know what you're gonna
wear on this runway

746
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,123
before you even
come out on the runway,"

747
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,592
I don't know
how you come back from that.

748
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:24,096
So Miss Scarlet has some
opinions about Vanjie and Silky.

749
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,098
Well, girl, what's the Tee,
Christine?

750
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,499
Yeah, those are the two.

751
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:30,402
And I honestly think that
those are the two to next go.

752
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:32,437
But y'all know me.
I'm gonna call her out.

753
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:36,475
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

754
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,076
Come on, cysts.

755
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,045
Come on, cyst.

756
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,781
Guess what we're doing today?
Makeovers.

757
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,984
We gotta drag up
the eliminated ho's

758
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,153
in our own drag styles.

759
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:49,921
-Are you excited?
-I am excited.

760
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,189
I can't wait to be a Hytes.

761
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,659
Not only do we have
to make over these girls,

762
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,360
but they can't touch themselves.

763
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,397
I'm so nervous.
Make me a woman.

764
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,731
I ain't no magician.

765
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,299
[laugh]
You can do it.

766
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,467
[Brooke Lynn]
They can't do their makeup.

767
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,635
They can't touch their hair.

768
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,970
Whatever we give them
is what they get.

769
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,841
My face is going to be
bruised up by the end of this.

770
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,479
All right, ladies and gents,
boys and girls.

771
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,480
I have a question.

772
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,882
[Yvie] Uh-oh.

773
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,917
Y'all know I'm the girl
that likes to clear the air.

774
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,553
What was said about
the whole wig situation?

775
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,888
[Ariel] Oh, God, the wigs.

776
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,958
Oh, it's about to be
some shit,

777
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,227
and I'm not in it.
Thank God.

778
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,562
So what's that Tee?

779
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,698
You guys took all of
Ariel's wigs after she left?

780
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,833
Now, bitch, you've been gone
from the very beginning.

781
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,468
How you know all the Tee?

782
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:37,936
[all laugh]

783
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,871
What were you told?

784
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,273
[Soju] That Ariel
left a lot of wigs.

785
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,076
And it wasn't meant
for everyone to take it.

786
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,744
Am I clearing out
the wig bullshit?

787
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:48,380
Sure, you might as well,
since it's your wigs, baby.

788
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,314
Go ahead.

789
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,718
Well, all right.
So when I was packing,

790
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,721
I left those wigs
all on that shelf by accident.

791
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,457
And the only wig
that was actually left behind

792
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,392
was that big old red wig
for Silky.

793
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,694
-Uh-huh.
-And that was it.

794
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,929
[Ariel] But I heard there
was a lot of shit, like--

795
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,497
-Did you leave some for--
-Oh, this is for me.

796
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:07,132
[A'Keria] Did you leave some
for your best friend?

797
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,669
'Cause after we took the wigs,

798
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,171
Plastique said that
the wigs were left for her

799
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,973
because y'all
were best friends.

800
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:17,609
She put all that hair
at my station.

801
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,478
-Did she write you a note?
-No.

802
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:21,213
But we were best friends.

803
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:23,849
So we were trying
to get to the bottom of that

804
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,985
and see what was actually the
truth with that whole situation.

805
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:28,587
We squashed this.

806
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,222
I made a comment.

807
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,890
Apparently
we didn't all squash it.

808
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,191
Because I did not care.

809
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,593
But it was brought up
yesterday again,

810
00:31:34,593 --> 00:31:35,927
even though if it was squashed.
That was the thing.

811
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,462
So that's why
I'm clearing the air now

812
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,297
that the actual horses
are in the building.

813
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,066
But, guys, the wigs--

814
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,334
[A'Keria] So, Ariel,
are y'all best friends,

815
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,869
and did you leave the wigs
for her?

816
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,170
I mean, obviously

817
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,605
I consider myself closest here
with Plastique.

818
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,373
-We bonded a lot.
-Okay.

819
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,775
But the wigs were left behind
by accident.

820
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,276
But I just want to know
where the fuck they all are,

821
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,645
because I don't see any of 'em.

822
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,782
Okay, well, your black wig
and your purple wig

823
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,016
is right there at my station.

824
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,384
No, no, no. I don't care
about the purple wig.

825
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:02,120
I know that Miss Ra'Jah
left with a bunch of them.

826
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,190
Only wig I knew Ra'Jah had
was the big purple crinkly one.

827
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,858
[Ariel] That's what
I'm pissed off about.

828
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,361
All of a sudden, it's okay.

829
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,029
She really just wants one wig,

830
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,031
and it just so happens
to be from the person

831
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,433
who is not in the workroom,
Miss Ra'Jah.

832
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,402
[Silky]
But Ariel, I make it known.

833
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,471
I did grab one or two more
because they was there.

834
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,312
Ariel's silent
as a fucking mouse.

835
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,347
So all that huffing and puffing,

836
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,083
and now it's all like
a misunderstanding.

837
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:34,753
[Shuga]
I did feel like, Ariel,

838
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:35,687
you were a little more mad
about it yesterday

839
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,088
than you are right now.

840
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,256
[Shuga] That's what
I was going to say, too.

841
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,893
Ariel was pissed,
and now she's very calm.

842
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:42,994
[laughs]

843
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,062
Yeah, legit,
you were saying like,

844
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,397
I'm getting in there
and pop off,

845
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,866
and then you ain't really
pop off just now.

846
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,001
Okay, well, it's not like
the wigs are $5.00,

847
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,138
so I fucking want
the wigs back obviously.

848
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,106
So now as I'm addressing it,

849
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,108
she's backpedaling and quits
popping all over the place.

850
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,878
Say what you mean, mama,
and mean what you say.

851
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,315
I got another question.

852
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,583
Oh, God.

853
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,420
I heard yesterday that
Scarlet was surprised

854
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,323
Vanjie and Silky were still here
in this competition.

855
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,490
Is that true?

856
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,592
That is true.

857
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,094
And what were you
surprised about?

858
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,429
Now, before
I read your eyeballs out,

859
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,264
go ahead and tell me why.

860
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,533
Especially with Silky.
Come on, girl.

861
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,969
Well, um...

862
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,470
Well?

863
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,138
Why, Miss Scarlet,

864
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,841
you got my motherfucking name
in your mouth?

865
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,077
The world wants to know
at this point.

866
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,513
Because you've had the most
assistance from the other girls.

867
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,250
You got to clear that up
for me, honey.

868
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,553
Because in this competition,
as people have helped me,

869
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,622
I have helped
every bitch in here, too.

870
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,257
So what do you mean by that?

871
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:47,392
It's the top six,
and I feel like--

872
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,095
But, girl,
don't go around the issue.

873
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,730
What have I had assistance with?

874
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,132
Because I want to say
one thing to everybody.

875
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,935
I have been nice
to every bitch up in here.

876
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,837
And for y'all to run my name
through the mud,

877
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:02,407
I have done mostly everything
for myself, so clear the air.

878
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:04,276
Well, I do think

879
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:07,345
that your runways are held
to a different standard.

880
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:10,282
Bitch, your runways look worse
than mine, so clear the air.

881
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,583
[Yvie] You guys act like

882
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,818
if somebody has
a negative opinion about you,

883
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,888
it means they goddamn hate you,
and that's not the Tee.

884
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,157
Scarlet, I would never say this,

885
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,525
but, you know,
you came for me a little bit,

886
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,060
so I will say that
you should have went home

887
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,895
the first time you lip synced
in that six-way.

888
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,263
[Silky] You should have.

889
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,431
[Vanjie]
Because I don't know

890
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,599
how you're gonna come
to Drag Race

891
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,600
and think
you're gonna survive a lip sync

892
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,035
without knowing how to move.

893
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,269
Yeah, I'm going tit fo tat.

894
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,637
At this point
in the competition,

895
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,439
the last thing I need

896
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,107
is for people to be kicking me
while I'm down.

897
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:37,309
So you gonna come for me,

898
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,310
I'm gonna come for you
a little bit, too.

899
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,811
[Silky] This is my thing.

900
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,514
To come back here in this time
is a privilege and an honor.

901
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,349
Had I come back,

902
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,850
I wouldn't have said
a damn thing negative

903
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,018
to any of you all.

904
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,621
Bitch, you literally
just talked about

905
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,222
how you thought Scarlet
should have been home

906
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,958
after the first fucking dance.

907
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,592
That's my opinion.

908
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,461
-Exactly. Exactly.
-And that's her opinion.

909
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,831
You need to stop taking
everything so personally.

910
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,199
Well, I take
that shit personal,

911
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,467
because when you say
everybody's helped me,

912
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,768
how, Mary?

913
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,270
All my shit is right here.

914
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,005
None of this shit
is borrowed.

915
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,073
Most of it I made.

916
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,708
So how did people help me?

917
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,942
Silky, you have been getting
a lot of help

918
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,010
throughout the competition.

919
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,244
But how?

920
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,946
You and the rest
of your dream girls

921
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,181
have all been there
for each other's back.

922
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,416
So has Nina.
Nina's been getting help.

923
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,820
It's the truth.

924
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,224
Silky has had the help
of the dream girls all season.

925
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,625
And I'm not saying
it's a bad thing

926
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,960
to have help from your sisters,

927
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,528
but Scarlet's not wrong
in saying

928
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:34,165
that Silky hasn't done
all of this by herself.

929
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,768
This bitch can't even say what
anybody has ever done for me.

930
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,069
Bitch.

931
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,738
[Silky] Say what somebody
has done for me

932
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,239
in this competition
other than them.

933
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,241
Okay, your hair.

934
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,043
Your hair, for starters.

935
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,379
You went to half of the girls
for sewing this and sewing that.

936
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:50,181
That is not true.
I sew everything of my own.

937
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:52,117
Yeah, we have the dream girls.

938
00:35:52,117 --> 00:35:54,486
But what they give me
more so than anything

939
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,820
is emotional support

940
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,656
for bitches like that
who say shit about me.

941
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,458
Fuck.

942
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,793
[Shuga] Y'all are crazy.

943
00:36:01,793 --> 00:36:02,927
You'll be fighting this
to the death, honey.

944
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,430
It's just an opinion, girl.

945
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,865
You can't get
so pressed about it.

946
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,000
And I just
answered the question.

947
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,168
No, you just got super salty

948
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,103
'cause a bitch
put your name out.

949
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,339
I did.

950
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,342
Look, everyone has opinions.
Scarlet had an opinion.

951
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,778
Why are you offended, and why
you jumping down her throat?

952
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:20,779
Goddamn.

953
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,614
Scarlet's just hating.

954
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,582
That's it, that's all.

955
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,285
Y'all look like some
salty maltese up in here.

956
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,820
So I'm a salty malty today.

957
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,256
Well, I'll be a salty malty,
so you can be a pressed panini.

958
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,191
Opinions are like assholes,
you know.

959
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,093
Most of them are on my face.

I've ever made.

00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:37,081
And then I'm modeling
a more recent redo of it

1002
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:40,318
because I want to show the
judges I can do some elevation.

These outfits
are quintessential Nina.

00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,471
They're inspired
by Kinky Boots from Broadway,

a message behind it.

00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,471
[A'Keria] I'm giving you
very Davenport style

1043
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,573
high fashion eleganza.

1044
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,941
I'm wearing a keyhole

1045
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:12,677
with the jewels that sit
almost to my breast,

1046
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,178
and my sister Honey,
she has on

1047
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,580
a little old piece of ruffle

1048
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,582
covering up
all those man muscles.

1049
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:20,218
And of course, gotta have on
some Texas hair, baby.

1050
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,787
This makeover
is definitely a success

1051
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,289
We know we the Tee, baby.

1052
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,325
[RuPaul] The Landers sisters
are still going strong.

1053
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:30,428
[Wanda]
So slow, though.

1054
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,563
Like The Real Housewives
of Molasses.

1055
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,366
[all laugh]

1056
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:40,004
[RuPaul] Up next, Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,

1057
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,906
and her sister Soju.

1058
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,608
[Lena] Studio 69.

1059
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,677
[all laugh]

1060
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:48,146
[RuPaul] Remember when Nell
Carter was on The Cher Show?

1061
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:50,181
[Michelle] Yes.
[all laugh]

1062
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,649
My favorite episode.

1063
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,786
[Silky] The Ganache family
is going to the disco.

1064
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,955
I have my sister, Miss Soju,

1065
00:40:56,955 --> 00:41:01,159
wearing a full bodysuit
that shows all her curves.

1066
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,894
Her bell bottoms are pointed

1067
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,196
to show a little bit
more character,

1068
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,664
and so you can get a sneak peek

1069
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,833
that that bitch is actually
wearing heels, baby.

1070
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:11,035
[RuPaul]
All right, sister Soju.

1071
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,337
[all laugh]

1072
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,372
[Silky] And I'm wearing
a jumpsuit

1073
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,741
with my bell bottoms
on the sleeves, honey.

1074
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,043
I got a little belt to give you
a little more shape,

1075
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,945
a little bit more curve.

1076
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,415
We on this runway showing shape
and eating grapes, honey.

1077
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:26,684
And we're waiting
on the after party.

1078
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,220
The pads are messy again.

1079
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,789
[Lena]
Cagney and Lacey.

1080
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,424
[Ross] Gag-me and Lacey.

1081
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:34,993
[all laugh]

1082
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:39,030
[RuPaul] Vanessa Vanjie Mateo
and Ariel Versace.

1083
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,065
-Ooh.
-Nice reveal.

1084
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:43,568
[RuPaul] Two little girls
from Glitter Rock.

1085
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,103
[all laugh]

1086
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,804
[Ross] I feel awful.
I can never remember.

1087
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,306
Which one's Tia,
which one's Tamera?

1088
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,274
[all laugh]

1089
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:54,645
[Vanjie] Tonight on the menu
is the Mateo Vanjie takeover.

1090
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,281
Me and Ariel are pumping down
the runway Miss Vanjie style.

1091
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,918
Looking disco
extra-greasy shortening.

1092
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,353
Blonde waved hair,

1093
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,690
bombshells down
with a good old breast sequin.

1094
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,525
Very sparkle, bling, bling.

1095
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:11,529
We got disco pants on me,
a beautiful gown on Ariel.

1096
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,731
I'm looking sickening,
she's looking fierce,

1097
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,866
and I'm living for it.

1098
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,001
[both] Miss Vanjie.

1099
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,904
Miss Vanjie.
-Uh-huh.

1100
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,106
[both] Miss Vanjie.

1101
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,808
[all laugh]

1102
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:27,345
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes
and Plastique Tiara.

1103
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:29,580
[Michelle] Whatever they have,
I think it's spreading.

1104
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,782
[all laugh]

1105
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:31,883
[Lena]
Somebody call the gardener.

1106
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,284
[all laugh]

1107
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,552
[Michelle] Some bushes
need to be whacked.

1108
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,987
[all laugh]

1109
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,189
[Brooke Lynn] This week,
the Hytes family legacy

1110
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:39,424
is being carried on

1111
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:42,260
with my new drag sister
Harlem Hytes.

1112
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,196
We are serving you
classic Hytes pageant glamour,

1113
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:48,599
with a lovely velvet gown
with sequin appliques,

1114
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,102
1940s movie star hair,

1115
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:53,805
looking unbothered
sauntering down the runway.

1116
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:56,441
The concept is very like
pageant-y evening gown walk

1117
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,975
with floating and some dance.

1118
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,645
I just wanted to be very
graceful and beautiful.

1119
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,313
[laughs]

1120
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,249
I taught Plastique a couple
Hytes evening gown moves:

1121
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,984
kick the train, you do
a little rond de jambe

1122
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,753
and the train kind of
flows in front of you.

1123
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,755
I want her to take her time

1124
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:13,458
to just really move her hips
and let the light bathe you.

1125
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,859
Alyssa Edwards
better watch out.

1126
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:16,661
She might have a daughter
jumping ship.

1127
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,429
[Lena]
There she is, Miss America.

1128
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,431
[Ross] I just feel bad
for the ugly sister.

1129
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,666
[all laugh]

1130
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,470
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

1131
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,739
It's time for
the judges' critiques.

1132
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,142
First up, Yvie Oddly.

1133
00:43:31,142 --> 00:43:32,810
I thought it was really fun
when you guys came out.

1134
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,278
Obviously you guys
are rock stars.

1135
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,813
I thought the look
was really great, you know,

1136
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:38,983
feeling a bit of an Ursula denim
situation happening,

1137
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,352
and I loved watching you guys.

1138
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,388
What I'm struggling with
is the construction of this.

1139
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:48,392
It's almost chic in
a futuristic almost kinda way,

1140
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,828
but it just looks
a little crafty.

1141
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,531
[Wanda] I mean,
I buy that you're sisters,

1142
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:56,300
except that it's like the little
sister trying to tag along.

1143
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,872
And you're giving her
your scraps of your scraps.

1144
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:03,574
This is the best that
my sisters have ever gotten.

1145
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,643
[all laugh]
Right, right.

1146
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,046
Up next, Nina West.

1147
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:11,215
-Hi, Shuga.
-Hi, Ru.

1148
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:13,351
Well, look, I know all about
wearing a rainbow, okay.

1149
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:15,620
[all laugh]

1150
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,955
I wear my pride
on my sleeve a lot,

1151
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,091
so I appreciated
that you guys did that tonight.

1152
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:22,827
You know, we have the rainbow
and you have the trans flag,

1153
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,495
but really we're sisters.

1154
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,364
So I got the message,
and I loved it.

1155
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,766
But I feel like
Shuga's lost in this.

1156
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:33,271
The hairdo, mm, mm.
And Shuga's makeup.

1157
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,072
I just know
how beautiful Shuga is and...

1158
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,742
-Okay.
-You know.

1159
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,210
And I can imagine
how hard it was

1160
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,213
for all of you queens to have
another queen do your face

1161
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:43,614
when you can't do a thing.

1162
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:47,518
Unfortunately, Shuga,
it's almost bordering on clowny.

1163
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,387
And you're--
Fashion should say something,

1164
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,655
and you're certainly
saying something

1165
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:51,956
on the runway tonight.

1166
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,291
The issue is this.

1167
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:56,027
These look like costumes
for a pride parade,

1168
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57,895
not fashiony for a runway.

1169
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,997
There's just certain boxes
you have to check

1170
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,832
in this challenge.

1171
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:06,971
Up next, A'Keria C. Davenport
and her sister Honey.

1172
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,673
-Hey.
-Hey.

1173
00:45:08,673 --> 00:45:10,174
I buy that you're sisters.

1174
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:14,745
It's very pageantry in
a Vanessa Williams kind of way.

1175
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:15,813
[all laugh]

1176
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:16,914
The hair's the same color,

1177
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,716
styled similarly, but different.

1178
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,484
You painted her beautifully,

1179
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,687
and I like what you did
with the keyhole.

1180
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,322
I have an affinity for it.

1181
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:28,125
There's just a lot that's
simple but effective here.

1182
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,528
And I love this kind
of pageant drag.

1183
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:33,764
You're not reinventing the wheel
with this,

1184
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,267
but sometimes the wheel's
just fine as it is.

1185
00:45:36,267 --> 00:45:40,538
Up next, the Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache

1186
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,139
and Soju.

1187
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,175
-Hi, Soju.
-Hi.

1188
00:45:44,175 --> 00:45:45,209
I missed you.

1189
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:48,346
I have to ask you,
how is the cyst?

1190
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,548
Haven't had any complaint, Ross.
Haven't had any complaints.

1191
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:51,682
[all laugh]

1192
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,184
I thought you guys
were a lot of fun.

1193
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,785
I really liked
the seventies of it all.

1194
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,320
That's my favorite era.

1195
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,156
But I do think there's
something about the costuming

1196
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,559
that felt
a little bit too Halloween.

1197
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,327
[Wanda]
I agree with Lena.

1198
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,597
I mean, it was more of a theme
instead of sisters.

1199
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,201
It's like somebody threw
Sonny and Cher in a blender

1200
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,136
and threw in a Jackson Five,

1201
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:15,740
and this is what,
you know, what we have.

1202
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,241
I made all of this.

1203
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,110
Probably the only queen
that made both looks.

1204
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,511
I just wanted to showcase Soju.

1205
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,047
Soju was the first one
to go home,

1206
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,449
and I wanted her to come out
in a different light

1207
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,718
and to be beautiful.

1208
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,286
But I'm going to call you out
again, Silky,

1209
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,890
'cause your makeup is gorgeous,
Soju's a little rough.

1210
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,792
That cheek is very heavy.

1211
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,594
Looks like it was blended
with a Dremel.

1212
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:40,831
And I see issues with your
padding again in the back.

1213
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,534
Also, I didn't feel like
I was looking at the Silky

1214
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,236
I've come to know and love.

1215
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,738
It felt like you kept
like looking over at Soju

1216
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:48,939
and being like,
oh, that's right,

1217
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:49,874
I'm supposed to go
like this now.

1218
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,275
You felt a little lost to me.

1219
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,812
I know that I can go
like at a thousand

1220
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,380
and leave my partner behind.
-Uh-huh.

1221
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,150
And so tonight I wanted to
bring it down a few notches.

1222
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,453
But unfortunately I guess
I brought it down too much.

1223
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:08,826
Up next, Miss Vanjie
and her sister Ariel Versace.

1224
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,462
You made me so proud tonight.

1225
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,597
-Ariel...
-Hi.

1226
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,700
She absolutely
looks like your sister.

1227
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,401
She looks better than me.
I was like...

1228
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,869
[Ariel laughs]
She took a lot of time

1229
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,806
to like really tailor this dress
in to like perfectly fit me

1230
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:24,775
and put a lot of detail
into everything.

1231
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,976
I didn't pay her
to say that, either.

1232
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,112
Y'all came out
and dropped those coats,

1233
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:29,980
and it was just stunning.

1234
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,551
Truly. It was very
Beyoncé-esque. It was good.

1235
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:37,922
And what I love about this
is how well executed it is.

1236
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,657
It's so smart to put
one of you in a dress

1237
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:40,858
and one of you in pants.

1238
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,926
It's so good.

1239
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:48,132
I just really wanted
to make you guys proud.

1240
00:47:48,132 --> 00:47:51,068
It was getting frustrating.

1241
00:47:53,938 --> 00:47:55,906
Up next,
it's Brooke Lynn Hytes

1242
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,342
and her sister Plastique.

1243
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,944
Silky, this is a great example.

1244
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:03,347
So we have an Asian sister,
and though we're not twins,

1245
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,149
you can tell there's
a family resemblance.

1246
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:07,485
And what I also liked
about the performance tonight,

1247
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,553
you told a story out there.

1248
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,589
When Plastique
stepped in front of you

1249
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:14,525
and there was a look--
no, no, no--

1250
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,693
it was so funny.

1251
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,461
[Lena] It was so classic.

1252
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:20,097
It was so beautifully done.
It was fantastic.

1253
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,966
You took my breath away
when you guys walked out.

1254
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,402
[Brooke Lynn] Sorry.

1255
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,406
I'm just really happy
the story came across,

1256
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,741
'cause this was kind of
a love letter to my drag mother,

1257
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,943
because she taught me
everything I know,

1258
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,379
and she's the reason
I'm here today.

1259
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,748
So it just really means
a lot to me that you got it.

1260
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,750
So thank you.

1261
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,885
Whoo.

1262
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:43,587
All right, ladies.
One more question.

1263
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,157
Who should go home tonight...

1264
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:50,194
and why?

1265
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,297
Start with Yvie Oddly.

1266
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,203
Silky is the one girl

1267
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:01,872
who's gotten the same critiques
a few times,

1268
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:03,374
and hasn't ever polished out

1269
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:05,743
the things that
you want to see from her.

1270
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,978
Scarlet Envy.

1271
00:49:07,978 --> 00:49:09,647
Well, it came out
in the workroom today,

1272
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:13,384
so Silky knows, I guess,
already.

1273
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,518
Nina West.

1274
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:15,920
Based on her critique tonight,

1275
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,522
I'm going to have to say
Yvie Oddly.

1276
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:19,523
Shuga.

1277
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,858
Unfortunately, Silky.

1278
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:24,461
Just because the critiques
that you've given her

1279
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,730
you've given her before,
and today was an opportunity

1280
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,300
for her to really pay attention
to those and execute,

1281
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,202
and it didn't happen.

1282
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:32,269
A'Keria.

1283
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,737
I'm gonna have to say Yvie,

1284
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,640
and that's based on
overall growth.

1285
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,310
At this point
it should be only elevation.

1286
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,779
Honey Davenport.

1287
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:44,715
Silky's outfit was the least
polished on the runway tonight.

1288
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,852
Silky.

1289
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,186
I would choose Yvie.

1290
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,655
As America's
next drag superstar,

1291
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,058
you have to be kind to people,

1292
00:49:54,058 --> 00:49:58,395
and she has not been
the most kind or the most nice.

1293
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,396
Soju.

1294
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,232
I would also have to Yvie,

1295
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,967
because I don't think her drag

1296
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:06,370
is on the level
of everyone else in the top six.

1297
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,907
Vanjie.

1298
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:11,976
Based on tonight,
I would say Yvie.

1299
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,444
Just because I feel like

1300
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,880
she kind of left her sister
a little behind.

1301
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,948
Ariel.

1302
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,183
I would also have to say Silky,

1303
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,019
just based off the critiques.

1304
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,954
-Brooke Lynn.
-I would have to say Silky.

1305
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:26,223
I just didn't think
the look was finished,

1306
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,326
and I just don't think there
was a great family resemblance.

1307
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,527
Plastique.

1308
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,230
I agree.
Silky just fell short.

1309
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,666
Thank you
for your honesty, ladies.

1310
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:38,903
Now, while you
untuck backstage,

1311
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:40,704
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1312
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:44,942
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

1313
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,144
what do you think?

1314
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,879
Let's start with Yvie Oddly.

1315
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,681
Yvie is an original.

1316
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,950
That is the toughest thing
to do in show business.

1317
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:55,019
-Don't I know it.
-[laughs]

1318
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:57,187
And when I look at this outfit
from way back here,

1319
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,958
I go, yeah,
that's an Yvie Oddly look.

1320
00:51:00,958 --> 00:51:02,860
The problem is
when you get a little close.

1321
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,528
[laughs]

1322
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:08,065
It looks like she put
a lot of time in her outfit--

1323
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,266
well, I mean, the scraps.

1324
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,668
But she put some time into 'em.

1325
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:14,138
But it's just like some
hand-me-down for her sister

1326
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:17,207
and told her to just
bring a pair of shoes.

1327
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:18,542
[Michelle]
Crystal shoes with that

1328
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,744
was not as good
as the denim shoe with that,

1329
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,813
which seems like little,
but at this point, it's not.

1330
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,782
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

1331
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:27,985
I love a rainbow look,
but it can be hit or miss.

1332
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,287
[Michelle] I mean,
she was wearing bike shorts.

1333
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:31,488
[chuckles]

1334
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,857
That she used her time
on this runway

1335
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,927
to make that kind of statement
is gorgeous.

1336
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,495
Unfortunately,
the outfits weren't.

1337
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,465
And whilst I appreciate
so greatly

1338
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,233
the rainbow flag
and the trans flag

1339
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:45,636
coming together as a statement,

1340
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,904
at the end of the day,

1341
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:49,373
this is a drag family
resemblance challenge,

1342
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,375
and there was no resemblance.

1343
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:54,178
[RuPaul]
A'Keria C. Davenport.

1344
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,547
Those two sold it,
and they looked beautiful.

1345
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,415
I think it kept true
to a Davenport.

1346
00:51:58,415 --> 00:51:59,750
They got it right.

1347
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,985
[RuPaul] The color scheme
was beautiful.

1348
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:03,654
They looked like
they were from the same house.

1349
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:05,622
In fact, I think Honey
has never looked better.

1350
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,691
That's really not Honey's style.

1351
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,259
She's a New York
sort of edgy queen.

1352
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,061
I told them
they didn't reinvent the wheel,

1353
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,830
but there's nothing wrong
with the wheel.

1354
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,198
You know, it's round, it works.

1355
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:15,265
You know,
if it ain't broke--

1356
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,367
-Put a wig on it.
-Exactly.

1357
00:52:16,367 --> 00:52:18,002
[all laugh]

1358
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:22,239
The Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1359
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,807
I think we should call Issa Rae,

1360
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,642
because that whole thing
was a little insecure for me.

1361
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,012
[all laugh]

1362
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:31,782
I didn't like that she tried
to use Soju as an excuse.

1363
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,852
She said, well, I had to
bring it down to help Soju out.

1364
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,553
She didn't need to do that.
Soju's red hot.

1365
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,890
Nope, sorry, that's her cyst.
[laughs]

1366
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,159
Tonight, Silky had some issues.

1367
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,361
She was looking a bit lumpy.

1368
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,896
The outfits
were a bit tattered,

1369
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,631
and I felt like there was
no family resemblance.

1370
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,633
These were two girlfriends
going out to a disco.

1371
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,235
[Ross] I love Silky.

1372
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,704
I think she has what it takes
to get to the finish line.

1373
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,073
I just hope
she's not running out of gas,

1374
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:57,674
'cause it kind of
feels that way.

1375
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,143
[RuPaul] Miss Vanjie.

1376
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:02,179
I think they just came out
with such confidence and swag

1377
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,515
that we were immediately
won over.

1378
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,450
[Wanda] They were
just gorgeous, stunning.

1379
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:07,851
I bought the whole thing.

1380
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,522
Loved the whole
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes look

1381
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,290
that Marilyn
and Jane Russell had.

1382
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,625
[Michelle]
Everything was on point.

1383
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,959
The way they were walking.

1384
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,795
The way that she did Ariel
was beautiful.

1385
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,229
[Ross]
I warned all the queens

1386
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:22,433
use every tool in your toolbelt
before it's too late,

1387
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:23,934
and Vanjie this week,

1388
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:27,071
she pulled out a hammer
and a wrench and a screwdriver,

1389
00:53:27,071 --> 00:53:28,739
and that's all the tools I know.

1390
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:30,841
-So proud of you.
-Yes, thank you.

1391

[all laugh]

1392
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,544
But she did it.

1393
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,412
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1394
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:37,681
Listen, what they did tonight
was classic Brooke Lynn,

1395
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:38,882
and it worked.

1396
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,518
There's no edge
to what she's bringing,

1397
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,719
which is the one thing

1398
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,854
that I'm sort of missing
from Brooke Lynn.

1399
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:46,690
But what she does
is so well done.

1400
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,158
You can't deny it.

1401
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:50,727
And I really liked
the story behind it.

1402
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,930
There was meaning to it.

1403
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,199
She didn't just pull something
out of her ass.

1404
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,967
She really wanted
to tell a story.

1405
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,168
Well, I mean, she really is

1406
00:53:58,168 --> 00:53:59,470
pulling something
out of her ass.

1407
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:00,471
Oh, that's true.

1408
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,638

Hey-oh.

1409
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,041
All right. Silence.

1410
00:54:04,041 --> 00:54:06,443
I've made my decision.

1411
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:08,378

1415

the Davenport family proud.

1427
00:54:43,914 --> 00:54:47,718
Tonight, you gave us
two sophisticated ladies.

1428
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:49,286
Yes.

1429
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,256
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

1430
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,191
Yes, bitch, work.

1431
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,261
You've won a trip to Aruba,

1432
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,697
including airfare
and a five-night stay

1433
00:55:00,697 --> 00:55:04,902
at the Aruba Marriott Resort
and Stellaris Casino.

1434
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,870
Come on, Aruba.
We're going to Aruba.

1435
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:07,938
Ah-ah-ah.

1436
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,506
Vanjie, we're going on vacation.

1437
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,941
Oh, yes.

Silky, we love your soul sister,

1445
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:36,700
but this week,
you dropped the disco ball.

1446
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,673
Nina, you wear your pride
on your sleeve,

1447
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:46,343
but the judges weren't feeling
your rainbow connection.

1448

[sighs]

1449
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:52,683
Yvie, being odd
is in your jeans,

1450
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,686
but your denim drag
gave us the blues.

1451
00:55:59,323 --> 00:56:00,691
Yvie Oddly...

1452
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:04,795
You're safe.

1453
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:08,131
Yes!
[cheers]

1454
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,001
You may join the other girls.

1455
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:13,337
Thank you.

1456
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:17,474
[RuPaul] Nina, Silky,
I'm sorry, my dears,

1457
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:20,210
but you are both up
for elimination.

1458
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,879
I'm fighting.

1459
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,014
I want to be here.
I want to make the five.

1460
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,782
I will not give up on this.

1461
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:28,018
-Has Nina lip synced yet?
-No.

1462
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,019
Neither one of them have.

1463
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,153
Silky hasn't lip synced, either.

1464
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,722
First time for both of them.

1465
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,658
[RuPaul] Two queens
stand before me.

1466
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:39,196
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1467
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,965
and save yourself
from elimination.

1468
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,469
The time has come...
[thunder]

1469
00:56:45,469 --> 00:56:48,138
for you to lip sync...

1471

This big body
can get really high,

1472
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,880
it can get really low,

1473
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,983
it can split, deal,
so I ain't worried for me.

1474

The bitch might as well pack
before I even get started.

the adventure that awaits me.

1551
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:28,258
Con-drag-ulations,
my top five queens.

1552
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,360
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1553
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,229
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1554
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,197
Can I get an amen up in here?

1555
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:35,432
-Amen.
-All right.

1556
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:36,733
