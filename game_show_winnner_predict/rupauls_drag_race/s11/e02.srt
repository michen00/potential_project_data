1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,696
Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:05,232
You need to create
your own unique look

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:08,702
using only the junk
inside these trunks.

4
00:00:08,703 --> 00:00:09,803
This is my first dress
I'm making.

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,740
Hey, what's up?
It's Miley Cyrus.

6
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,076
I wanted to go undercover
with the ladies.

7
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:19,179
-Wait a minute.
-Aah!

8
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,082
Drag Race is crazy.

9
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,517
Soju.

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:24,651
The tulle is
hitting at different lengths.

11
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:25,652
There's giant knots
in the back.

12
00:00:25,653 --> 00:00:28,188
Kahanna Montrese.

13
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,190
How would you describe
your drag?

14
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:31,959
This is not a good
representation of my drag.

15
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:34,461
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

16
00:00:34,462 --> 00:00:36,530
That is a mic drop, bitch.

17
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:38,765
-It's that star power.
-Thank you.

18
00:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,401
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

19
00:00:41,402 --> 00:00:43,704
Kahanna Montrese,
shantay you stay.

20
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:44,771
Thank you so much.

21
00:00:44,772 --> 00:00:47,407
Soju, sashay away.

22
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:58,752
Oh, girl.

23
00:00:58,753 --> 00:01:01,021
-Rough.
-First one done.

24
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,222
Literally the hardest thing

25
00:01:02,223 --> 00:01:04,257
I think I've ever
had to do in my life.

26
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:08,562
Soju. "I love all of you
cysters."

27
00:01:08,563 --> 00:01:10,497
That's fun.

28
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:12,432
We miss you, cyst.

29
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,534
-Oh, cyst.
-Disgusting.

30
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:16,503
So on the runway,

31
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:18,972
Soju starts to talk about
how she has a cyst

32
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:20,874
on her...taint.

33
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,376
I grew a cyst

34
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:24,578
and then it popped
in the plane ride here.

35
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:28,548
So like right now I'm oozing,
and it's just been a messy week.

36
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:32,319
She was like,
it's actually leaking now.

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,222
There's just some things
you don't do.

38
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:37,124
I don't give a fuck
if it was inflamed

39
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,759
to the size
of "Guantamano" Bay.

40
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,561
You never say "cyst"
when Mama Ru's in your presence.

41
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,063
Girl!

42
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:43,964
Congratulations, mama.

43
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:47,734
How do you feel, girl?

44
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:49,302
I feel amazing.

45
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,171
Go ahead.
Go to Paris, girl.

46
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:53,106
Let her go on her trip
tomorrow.

47
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,541
We're watching you now, girl.

48
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,510
Go ahead.

49
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:58,311
Not only did I survive
the first elimination,

50
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,380
I thrived
in the first elimination.

51
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:05,419
I was disappointed that I
didn't win the first challenge.

52
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,554
When we were talking,
a lot of the girls said

53
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:10,357
that my dress was something
that they would actually wear.

54
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:15,162
Scarlet is delusional.

55
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,463
I'm gonna say
this is a beautiful dress,

56
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,265
but I'm looking at it now

57
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:20,634
and I see tons of holes.

58
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,671
Believe it.

59
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:27,207
Girl. Bitch.

60
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,143
Brooke Lynn
won the first challenge.

61
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,045
I'm gonna cry
this feels so good.

62
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,747
So of course
she's feeling her oats

63
00:02:33,748 --> 00:02:35,515
the hardest of everyone.

you forget that
there are other oats there.

68
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:47,961
And to discount anyone
in this competition...

69
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:51,998
is a huge mistake.

70
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:58,138

Miss Vanjie is still here.

81
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:27,300
I'm here to deliver.

82
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:28,635
I ain't walking backwards
no time soon.

83
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:30,070
Catch that.

84
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,105
I'm about to get
some shit started now.

85
00:03:32,106 --> 00:03:34,007
As always. What's new?

86
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:36,643
Bang, marry, kill.

87
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:40,013
You start first, baby.

88
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,414
-Oh, my God.
-Careful. Careful.

89
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,150
I know.
This is a hard one.

90
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,151
I'd marry Plastique.

91
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:46,553
As Bianca Del Rio says,

92
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:49,756
beauty fades, bitch.
Beauty fades.

93
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,124
You gotta get you a bitch

94
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:53,293
that can fry some chicken
like me, bitch.

95
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:55,495
I would bang Silky.

96
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:00,567
All right, all right.

97
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:03,136
And he would also kill Silky.

98
00:04:03,137 --> 00:04:03,703
Yeah, I feel like
I would have to.

99
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:08,441
So much for that chicken, girl.

100
00:04:08,442 --> 00:04:10,277
I'm deciding backward.
I'm gonna kill Silky.

101
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:13,647
And I would definitely
have to kill Silky.

102
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:15,715
Is everybody gonna kill me?

103
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:16,683
Bitch, I'll kill
all the rest of you,

104
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:17,784
'cause somebody's got to win.

105
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:18,985
That's the only way
you will win.

106
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,558
Oh, girl!

107
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:28,061
She done already
done had herses.

108
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:29,062
Hey, tootsies.

109
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:32,465
Wanna be queen of the desert?

110
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:35,001
Because some do like it hot.

111
00:04:35,002 --> 00:04:37,304
Strap on those kinky boots,

112
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:39,306
don't forget your hair spray,

113
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,741
and thanks for everything,
Julie Newmar.

114
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,880
Hello, hello, hello.

115
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,050
Hey, it's Ru, bitch.

116
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:53,153
Ladies, America's
next drag superstar

117
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:56,456
needs to know how to pull focus.

118
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:59,359
So today, you'll be
stealing the spotlight

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,062
in one of my favorite
mini challenges:

120
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:05,599
the celebrity photobomb.

121
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,303
The two queens who are the most
extra at photobombing win.

122
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:12,572
-Okay.
-#DragRace.

123
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:15,475
Now, you have 15 minutes
to get into quick drag.

124
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:17,077
Ready, set, go!

125
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,748
What the fuck, bitch?

126
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,584
Girl, this is ricky ticky, baby.

127
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,152
Time's up, ladies.

128
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:28,755
All right, first up, Nina West.

129
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,357
Now, you're going to be
photobombing

130
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:32,425
Cardi B at the VMAs.

131
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:35,028
I am her long-lost
second cousin Sennahe.

132
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:36,429
-Sennawho?
-Sennahe?

133
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,298
-Sennawhat?
-Sennehe, dear.

134
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:40,133
-Ooh, girl.
-Big uhh!.

135
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:42,035
Say queen.

136
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:44,004
Now, you're
going to be photobombing

137
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,206
Amber Rose doing a selfie.

138
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,141
I'm just going to be
like straddling her?

139
00:05:48,142 --> 00:05:50,043
-Get in there.
-Oh, yeah.

140
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,378
-Give it to me.
-I'm just like shook.

141
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,748
[RuPaul] Oh, you are shook.

142
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:56,349
Are you the flower girl?

143
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,917
No, I was supposed
to be the wedding girl.

144
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,488
I'm so sad.

145
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,090
I'm gonna snap.

146
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:08,495
You're going to be photobombing
Tom Brady making a pass.

147
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,697
Silky sometimes brings
all the ho out in me.

148
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:12,966
Tom Brady
about to get all of this.

149
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,171
Ain't no Deflategate
going on here, girl.

150
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:19,706
You're not modest at all.

151
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:21,374
Oh, what you--
oh, you gonna show more?

152
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,543
Oh, girl.
Oh, let me catch all of this.

153
00:06:23,544 --> 00:06:25,378
Get these cookies.

154
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:29,749
Yes to all that
Silky Ganache.

155
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,119
Touchdown!

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,454
What's your favorite
Celine song?

157
00:06:34,455 --> 00:06:36,289
Good old Titanic,
My Heart Will Go On.

158
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,357
How boring.

159
00:06:39,092 --> 00:06:41,027
Yeah, you right up in there.

160
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:42,996
Look at you.

161
00:06:42,997 --> 00:06:44,597
You're so pretty.

162
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:45,598
Oh, sis.

163
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,233
Oh, sis.

164
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,401
That's gorgeous.

165
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:52,505
God. Oh, oh, that's hot.

166
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,441
You think Mariah's
never seen that before?

167
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,143
The shade of it all.

168
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:58,611
You wanna see Shallow Hal?

169
00:06:58,612 --> 00:07:01,147
Bitch, here's your Shallow Hal.

170
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:03,483
That's a mouthful.

171
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:04,584
Oh, you want his autograph.

172
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,252
Nice.

173
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:09,122
N-N-Nicki Minaj.

174
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:12,258
Her anaconda don't,
but yours do.

175
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:14,060
Brooke Lynn Hytes
and the Macrons

176
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:15,662
and some other people.

177
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:18,064
Oh, okay, yeah.

178
00:07:18,065 --> 00:07:19,699
I think I'll get
a few extra ones of this one.

179
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,168
Impressive how you can

180
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:23,703
keep your legs up like that
for so long.

181
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,438
I've had lots of practice.

182
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,442
Welcome to America.

183
00:07:29,443 --> 00:07:31,378
Kellyanne Conway

184
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,347
with the leaders
of the Black Caucus.

185
00:07:34,348 --> 00:07:36,983
I'm checking
if she's wearing panties.

186
00:07:39,052 --> 00:07:40,754
She's just gonna
take a little nap.

187
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,256
I think Bush
is back in the White House.

188
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:46,726
Ra'Jah O'Hara
photobombing Anna Wintour.

189
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,228
I'm with this bitch
right here.

190
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,729
Yes, mommy.

191
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,233
You're going to be photobombing
Madonna and Kim K.

192
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:54,367
Get 'em like this, mommy.

193
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:56,136
-Okay. Yeah, yeah, mama.
-Get those cookies.

194
00:07:56,137 --> 00:07:58,471
Ooh, coo-coo-coo-cookies.

195
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,373
What the f-stop?

196
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:03,710
Ladies,
two of you really bombed.

197
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,212
In a good way.

198
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:07,414
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

199
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,517
Thank you.

200
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:12,719
And Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

201
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:19,993
You've each won
a $1.000 gift certificate

202
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,695
from Fierce Queen.

203
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:26,466
Ladies, Hollywood
is breaking stereotypes

204
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:28,568
and box office records

205
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,739
with blockbuster films
celebrating black empowerment.

206
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,974
And now it's our turn.

207
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,577
Now, for this week's
maxi challenge,

208
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:41,247
you'll be starring
in two breakthrough films

209
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:45,919
featuring, get this,
an all drag queen cast.

210
00:08:51,524 --> 00:08:56,329
Now, the first film is called
Good God Girl, Get Out!

211
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,333
Now, the second film is called

212
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:02,402
Why It Gotta Be Black,

213
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:05,004
Panther?

214
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,440
Now, you'll work in two teams.

215
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,677
Brooke Lynn and Silky,
you're team captains.

216
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:13,046
You get to choose your cast.

217
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,348
All right, Suzanne Somers.

218
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:18,418
I mean, Brooke Lynn,
you choose first.

219
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:19,419
Nina West.

220
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,354
Let's get some drag empowerment.

221
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:23,056
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

222
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:25,191
-A'Keria.
-All right.

223
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:27,961
-Come on, Ra'Jah.
-All right, girl.

224
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:29,462
Miss Vanjie.

225
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:31,531
Come on, bitch, let's do this.

226
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:32,465
Honey, Honey, Honey, Honey.

227
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:35,235
Mercedes.

228
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:37,504
-Come give me some Shuga.
-Yes!

229
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:38,671
Yvie.

230
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,973
Okie diddly dokey.

231
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,744
-Plastique Fantastique.
-Thank you.

232
00:09:44,745 --> 00:09:47,213
-Kahanna.
-Silky, Silky, Silky, Silky.

233
00:09:47,214 --> 00:09:51,017
Now, that leaves Scarlet Envy
and Ariel Versace.

234
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,153
Ariel, come be part
of this world.

235
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:56,022
Thanks, bitch.

236
00:09:56,023 --> 00:09:58,525
Miss Scarlet
is looking pressed

237
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,026
like a panini, bitch.

238
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:01,227
She is pissed off.

239
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,563
Which means, Scarlet Envy

240
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:07,000
is with Team Silky
Nutmeg Ganache.

241
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:08,935
Come on, bitch,
I got Scarlet fever. Come on.

242
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,171
I should not be the last pick,

243
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:14,440
especially
on an acting challenge.

244
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,743
I am Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

245
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:18,745
Big mistake.

246
00:10:18,746 --> 00:10:19,779
Huge.

247
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,516
Gentlemen, start your engines,

248
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:25,785
and may the best woman win.

249
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:30,089
Silky's team, they're
a lot of big personalities.

250
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,458
It's gonna be chaos.

251
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:35,195
Like...girl.

252
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,229
Good luck.

253
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:39,199
For today's maxi challenge,

254
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,234
we are going to be acting
in hit movies.

255
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,469
This is our first
big acting challenge,

256
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,139
so we really got to impress them
at this point.

257
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,141
I don't know
if this is too stereotypical,

258
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:49,642
but if you could read Nails

259
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:52,312
in like a Vietnamese
like nail technician.

260
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:53,613
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God, okay.

261
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,517
Dragkanda is a mystical land

262
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:58,718
where drag queens run free

263
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,219
-and wigs grow on trees.
-That's it.

264
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,987
Can I take that?

265
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:05,291
I have very little
acting experience.

266
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,293
However,
I wanted to show the judges

267
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:10,730
I can be more than just
the prettiest one, so...

268
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:12,298
All right, ladies.

269
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,268
I want the main role
to go to Scarlet.

270
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:18,004
I want you to get real white
on that, honey.

271
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,373
I don't know if Silky
is trying to sabotage me

272
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:22,275
by giving me the most lines
to memorize,

273
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:24,711
but, I mean,
this is the lead role.

274
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:26,412
This is where I belong.

275
00:11:26,413 --> 00:11:29,015
And then we got Kahanna
as Henrietta.

276
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:30,650
I'm looking at the script,

277
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:33,553
and I'm seeing
there's only two lines.

278
00:11:33,554 --> 00:11:37,523
I'm just super worried
that my lines are so short.

279
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,524
No, but that's the thing.

280
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,059
You've seen this in the past.

281
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,227
Like you just punch them out.

282
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:43,096
So you're at an advantage.

283
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:44,030
You don't have to memorize much.

284
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,465
I really don't know

285
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,100
which direction to go in
with this character,

286
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:50,370
but after having to lip sync
for my life last week,

287
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,537
I've got to bring it
to the table.

288
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,740
Let's read, bitch.

289
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,575
Marnie, we're driving
all the way

290
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:57,210
to visit your
heterosexual parents,

291
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:59,679
but do they know
I'm a drag queen?

292
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,418
Oh, Christine, I'm just a plain
old hetero-normative girl.

293
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:08,688
Now you're in
the between-me-down-there.

294
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:10,556
What the fuck is that?

295
00:12:10,557 --> 00:12:12,425
Baby, I'm looking at this script

296
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:14,093
like it's the Da Vinci Code
or some shit.

297
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,396
I don't even know
what is on this paper.

298
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:17,664
I need somebody to give me
some syllables or something.

299
00:12:17,665 --> 00:12:19,165
I don't know.

300
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,566
I mean, you're not really
supposed to know

301
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:21,534
what it is, anyway, so it
kind of makes sense, you know.

302
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:22,702
Well, I really don't know.

303
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:25,104
Method, honey, method.

304
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:27,306
Right. It's my first
acting challenge,

305
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:29,642
and I know, baby,
the pressure is on.

306
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:32,278
I gotta show that I can channel
all this bullshit energy

307
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,480
that I got into some
shit constructive.

308
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:39,085
Hey, kitty girls.

309
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:40,553
-Hey, Ru.
-Hey.

310
00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:44,590
-Hello, team.
-Hi, Ru.

311
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,026
-So you're the team leader.
-Uh-huh.

312
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:47,760
How did you assign roles?

313
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:49,529
I picked the people

314
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,497
I thought had the strongest
theater backgrounds,

315
00:12:51,498 --> 00:12:54,233
and people I thought worked well
as a group together.

316
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:58,471
So who on the other team do you
all think is the one to beat?

317
00:12:58,472 --> 00:13:00,440
Are there any theater majors
over there?

318
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,241
Not that I know of.

319
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,043
I feel like there's a
lot of personality over there,

320
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,245
and it might...clash.
-Clash.

321
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:08,414
Who on the other team
is problematic?

322
00:13:08,415 --> 00:13:11,150
I think their team captain
is a little problematic.

323
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:14,187
She's very loud,
she's a big personality,

324
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:16,656
and I feel like at this point,

325
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:21,027
she's not gonna let anybody else
on her team shine over her.

326
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:24,297
So they might be in trouble.

327
00:13:24,298 --> 00:13:26,999
Has anyone else on this team
experienced that?

328
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,469
I think we've all
experienced it

329
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,536
-being in the workroom.
-How could you not?

330
00:13:30,537 --> 00:13:32,638
Yeah, she knows she's on TV

331
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,040
and she's gonna get her moment

332
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:36,209
and they're gonna see her.

333
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,543
She's gonna get her TV time.

334
00:13:37,544 --> 00:13:39,278
Like when we were in
with Miley,

335
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,247
she picked her up,
she was on her back.

336
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:44,283
Like, it was all her,
and it's just a lot.

337
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:46,719
Wow. Are you all
trying to one-up her

338
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,554
in the attitude department?

339
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:50,790
-No.
-I don't think so.

340
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,792
No? Well, you might want
to think about it.

341
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:54,527
You know. You know.

342
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:55,795
I just think that
there's a difference

343
00:13:55,796 --> 00:13:57,830
between having a strong
personality and being obnoxious.

344
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:03,970
-Okurrr, damn.
-I mean, listen.

345
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,404
Whatever.

346
00:14:05,405 --> 00:14:07,006
Well, I'm gonna
go check in with her

347
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:07,874
and see what she says
about you guys.

348
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,546
All right, well, get to it.
Make me laugh.

349
00:14:13,547 --> 00:14:14,614
Thank you, Ru.

350
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:17,250
Hey, ladies.

351
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:18,484
-Hi, Ru.
-Hi.

352
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:21,220
So, Silky, why did you
choose these girls?

353
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:23,055
I wanted all girls of color
and one white girl.

354
00:14:23,056 --> 00:14:24,657
So you're racially profiling.

355
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,660
So, now, Silky,

356
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:30,129
would you say you're a success
as a team leader?

357
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,698
I am successful because
I have a successful cast.

358
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,101
Well, the other team

359
00:14:35,102 --> 00:14:37,170
had some words
about your performance,

360
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:39,939
not just in this challenge,
but about before.

361
00:14:41,707 --> 00:14:43,276
Did you hear any of the Tee?

362
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,411
No, tell me the Tee.
What's the Tee?

363
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:48,481
Well, they're saying that you
dominate all the conversations

364
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:51,417
and they can't get
a word in edgewise,

365
00:14:51,418 --> 00:14:53,519
and you suck the air
out of the room.

366
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,856
I'm sorry that I was given
a big straw to suck.

367
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,628
Tell me,
how big is that straw?

368
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:04,697
Real big, Ru.

369
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:09,135
You know what?

370
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,003
Certain people have a perception
about me at this point.

371
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:12,672
This is something
that many of you may not know,

372
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:15,441
but I have a master's degree
in organizational leadership.

373
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,476
-Really?
-I actually do,

374
00:15:17,477 --> 00:15:19,745
and I just applied for the Ph.D.
program in global leadership.

375
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:22,682
So when business come,
I'm gonna go handle business.

376
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:25,318
But when it's time for pleasure,
I'm gonna have pleasure.

377
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,257
How about that?

378
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,726
Well, good God, girl,
get it on.

379
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:38,431
Look, I cannot wait
to see this movie

380
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:41,100
by the future
Dr. Silky Ganache.

381
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:42,735
Remember your lines,

382
00:15:42,736 --> 00:15:45,304
and let the other kids either
have a word in edgewise or not.

383
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:46,606
Or not.

384
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:49,075
Thanks, Ru.

385
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:52,078
That's so ridiculous.

386
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,379
The other team got to go.

387
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,416
They have criticized me
and my leadership skills.

388
00:15:57,417 --> 00:15:59,552
They have talked about me
like a dog.

389
00:15:59,553 --> 00:16:01,687
They have drug me
through the mud.

390
00:16:01,688 --> 00:16:03,422
It really, really pisses me off.

391
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,291
If that's what y'all
think about me for real,

392
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:06,959
I'm glad I chose
the bitches I chose.

393
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,029
You mad 'cause you ain't
on the team, bitch.

394
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,231
Girl, you're the team leader.

395
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,367
If you fall apart,
we're all lost as hell.

396
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:15,635
Boy, them bitches
done pissed me off.

397
00:16:15,636 --> 00:16:18,604
They have just
worked my nerves, honey.

398
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:22,241
Good God, girl,
snap the hell out of it.

399
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,711
It's time for our team
to shoot our movie

400
00:16:25,712 --> 00:16:27,113
with Ross and Michelle.

401
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:29,048
Instantly
I already get nervous.

402
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:32,351
Hi, ladies.
Welcome to the set

403
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,452
of Why It Gotta Be Black,
Panther?

404
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,555
All right,
let's go to Dragkanda.

405
00:16:35,556 --> 00:16:38,391
Places, ladies, places.

406
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:39,458
And action.

407
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,627
Great-Aunt Max'ine,
is that you?

408
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:45,064
There is a rival panther
coming for your crown.

409
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:47,300
-Beyon-what?
-Cut.

410
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:50,036
-Brooke Lynn, Beyoncé what.
-Beyoncé what.

411
00:16:50,037 --> 00:16:52,271
Yeah, so make sure you get out
the Beyoncé into what.

412
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:54,173
Beyoncé what?

413
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:57,209
Brooke Lynn, do you understand
the Beyoncé what line?

414
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,513
Just get that "cé",
"Beyon-cé" what?

415
00:17:00,514 --> 00:17:01,580
Okay.

416
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:02,648
So we know it's the "say what."

417
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,317
That's the joke, you see.

418
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,319
Beyoncé what?

419
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Action.

420
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:09,255
Beyoncé what?

421
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,590
If you stay woke... [coughs]

422
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:13,492
You won't need to get woke.

423
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,094
And cut.

424
00:17:15,095 --> 00:17:17,964
Yeah, Auntie Max'ine,
I really like what you're doing.

425
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:19,465
One quick note.

426
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,133
I've seen people do marijuana.

427
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,703
They inhale and then sometimes
they talk when it's in there,

428
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:24,737
and then exhale.

429
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,005
Try it there.

430
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,106
And action.

431
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:33,412
If you stay woke...
you won't need to get woke.

432
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,683
Nailed it.

433
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:41,687
So here we are in
Sissy's drag closet laboratory

434
00:17:41,688 --> 00:17:43,055
with all her gadgets.

435
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:45,057
And action.

436
00:17:45,058 --> 00:17:46,993
Chicago Black Panther

437
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:50,129
is coming to try to snatch
my crown, and I need your help.

438
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,065
Girl, Chicago Black Panther?

439
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:55,501
Girl, I follow her on Instagram.

440
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:57,203
Have you see her?

441
00:17:57,204 --> 00:17:59,238
Girl, all I'm saying is

442
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,207
if it's a battle of looks
between the two of you,

443
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,242
girl, you gonna lose.

444
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:07,113
Cut. Ariel, your adding
the affectation

445
00:18:07,114 --> 00:18:10,549
of "girl" onto everything.
Don't need it.

446
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,019
Let's pluck a couple
of those girls out of there.

447
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,553
-Okay.
-Action.

448
00:18:14,554 --> 00:18:17,289
Chicago Panther is coming
to try to snatch my crown.

449
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,357
I need your help.

450
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:21,027
Girl, I follow her
on Instagram.

451
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:22,695
Have you seen her?

452
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:25,231
These killer heels,

453
00:18:25,232 --> 00:18:28,567
well, girl, they will
make your booty pop.

454
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:30,403
Okay, let's move on
to the next scene. Thank you.

455
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:35,674
Not only am I the legitimate
heir to the throne of Dragkanda,

456
00:18:35,675 --> 00:18:37,209
I'm legitimately hotter.

457
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,477
Right, Nails?

458
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:41,280
Whatever you say, Chicago.

459
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,616
But now that
we are inside Dragkanda,

460
00:18:43,617 --> 00:18:47,486
I can get my hands on the
all-powerful charisminum.

461
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:48,754
[laughs]

462
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,690
Now give me the charisminum

463
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:52,124
or feel my wrath!

464
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:57,696
Can you say it again for me?

465
00:18:57,697 --> 00:18:58,531
Charisminum.

466
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:03,102
And action.

467
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:06,439
Chicago Panther and Nails
have breached the panty shield.

468
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,641
Oh, no,
I think they're coming.

469
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:15,247
Not only am I the legitimate--
I'm sorry.

470
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:16,115
Why don't we go back
to the top?

471
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,383
Why don't we go back?

472
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,051
Do I hit the spot
and then say the line?

473
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,119
Take a few steps and start.

474
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,621
And action.

475
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:24,957
Not only am I
the le...gitimate--

476
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,959
Ra'Jah, have fun.

477
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,094
Don't get caught up
in the lines.

478
00:19:28,095 --> 00:19:29,228
You look stressed.

479
00:19:29,229 --> 00:19:31,464
And your character is so badass

480
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:33,532
that you can't look like
you're thinking.

481
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,201
Okay.

482
00:19:35,202 --> 00:19:36,435
This is going to be
your last take,

483
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,104
so really go for it, okay?

484
00:19:38,105 --> 00:19:38,971
Action.

485
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,709
Not only am I the legitimate
queen of Dragkanda,

486
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,545
I'm also legitimately hotter.

487
00:19:49,682 --> 00:19:51,550
This is not good for Ra'Jah.

488
00:19:51,551 --> 00:19:54,286
There--there's danger,
Will Robinson.

489
00:19:54,287 --> 00:19:57,022
That's a wrap on
Why It Gotta Be Black, Panther?

490
00:19:57,023 --> 00:20:00,526
Oh, God, Ra'Jah.
This fucking sucks.

491
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:04,530
That's how I'm feeling
right now.

492
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:07,600
This is me waving
a white flag of surrender.

493
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,471
-Hi, ladies.
-Hello.

494
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:13,772
Ladies?

495
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:16,075
I definitely don't look like
no lady right now.

496
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,244
Our moment is here,
so I have to turn the party.

497
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:20,246
I gotta be a standout
in this group.

498
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,548
Come on, Beyoncé.

499
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:26,252
Welcome to the set of
Good God Girl, Get Out!

500
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:29,388
I love it.
We got some flavor up in here.

501
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:30,689
Yeah, adobo.

502
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,358
All right, let's set up
for the driving scene.

503
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,159
Come on, sis.

504
00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:36,061
Action.

505
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:39,465
I'm just a plain old
hetero-normative girl,

506
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:42,034
but all of my best friends
have been drag queens.

507
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:49,308
Cut.

508
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:50,543
I want more out of
that laugh from you.

509
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:53,546
-More?
-I like how it built. Yeah.

510
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:56,582
But all of my best friends
have been drag queens.

511
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:06,258
Great.

512
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,060
-Thank you.
-Moving on.

513
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:11,564
Oh, my God, Dad,
why are you wearing a wig?

514
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:14,300
You're embarrassing me.

515
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,268
Hello, hello, hello,
Christine.

516
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,071
I'm not a regular dad.
I'm a cool dad.

517
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:21,740
Vanjie, right now it's just
coming across like you.

518
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:23,309
So I wonder if there's a way

519
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,277
to find a little more
dorky dad in there.

520
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:27,546
Hello, hello, hello.

521
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,248
I can try dorky.
Let's do dorky.

522
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,650
-Action.
-Hello, hello, hello.

523
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,519
Hi, Christine.

524
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,054
I'm a regular dad.

525
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:38,023
I'm not a regular dad.
I'm cool.

526
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,758
And I've been to DragCon
three times.

527
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,160
Okur-ka-ka-ka-kurrr?

528
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,761
Wait. Vanjie, do me a favor.

529
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:44,330
I love the energy, but
it's a little Cookie Monster,

530
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:45,364
and the crumbs are everywhere.

531
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:46,632
Soften it a little bit.

532
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:49,101
-Duly noted.
-And action.

533
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:51,237
Hello, hello, hello, Christine.

534
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,605
What the fuck?

535
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:57,810
Okay, let's go back
to Cookie Monster.

536
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,712
-I like the other one.
-Go back to Cookie Monster.

537
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:01,680
Let's move on
to the next scene.

538
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:03,249
And action.

539
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,720
Upulence.
You own everything.

540
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,455
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

541
00:22:09,456 --> 00:22:11,357
Mercedes, opulence.

542
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:12,358
Make sure we hear that, okay?

543
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,359
Upulence.

544
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,760
And action.

545
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:19,398
Upulence,
you earn everything.

546
00:22:19,399 --> 00:22:21,667
Opulence,
you own everything.

547
00:22:21,668 --> 00:22:23,469
Action.

548
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,406
Upulence, you earned--

549
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,608
Own. You own.

550
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,577
-You own it.
-Own.

551
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:35,214
Opulence is like you're so
ridiculously opulent and rich

552
00:22:35,215 --> 00:22:36,682
that you can buy
whatever you want.

553
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:38,284
So you own everything.
It's yours.

554
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:39,385
Own.

555
00:22:39,386 --> 00:22:41,320
Don't forget,
you own everything.

556
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:43,255
-You own.
-You own. Here we go.

557
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:48,560
Upulence,
you own everything.

558
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:50,429
Touch this skin.

559
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:56,302
It's still just like opulence,
you have everything.

560
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:59,805
And Kahanna is trying to do,
you know,

561
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:02,341
what it is that's over the top,

562
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:05,711
but it just still looks
like a flapping duck.

563
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:07,112
Let's set up
for the last scene.

564
00:23:07,113 --> 00:23:08,447
Okay, this is it.

565
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:09,481
Action.

566
00:23:09,482 --> 00:23:11,984
Girl, you haven't
realized by now

567
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:14,486
this entire movie is a metaphor

568
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:20,192
on...mainstream society's...
appropriation

569
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:22,428
for the drag queen culture.

570
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:24,363
Real quickly, Silky,
give me your line one more time.

571
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,699
You haven't realize this
by now...

572
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,133
That?

573
00:23:28,134 --> 00:23:31,637
That this entire movie is...

574
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:33,105
Metaphor.

575
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:34,640
-Oh, that this entire.
Right.

576
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:38,277
-Go, go.
-This entire movie is based on--

577
00:23:38,278 --> 00:23:40,379
A metaphor.
Not based on true anything.

578
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,014
Just bullshit society.

579
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:44,149
This entire movie
is based on--

580
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,351
Metaphor.

581
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:47,519
Have you not
realized this by now

582
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,023
that this entire movie
is a metaphor

583
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:54,226
on the mainstream society's

584
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:56,695
appropriated
a drag queen culture?

585
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:58,097
Stay in the moment.

586
00:23:58,098 --> 00:23:58,764
Look at them.
Look at them.

587
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,232
[flick]

588
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:02,701
Step away from the mother
clucking drag queen.

589
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,105
That fan won't stop us.

590
00:24:06,106 --> 00:24:08,040
Silky, that's you.

591
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:09,641
That fan ain't gonna do shit.

592
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:12,244
No, but my
DMV-issued taser will.

593
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,348
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Listen.

594
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:18,751
Silky, you can't laugh, girl.

595
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:20,652
This is like Fight Club.

596
00:24:20,653 --> 00:24:22,454
Guys, I don't want
to do this anymore, please.

597
00:24:22,455 --> 00:24:23,655
Wrap it up.

598
00:24:23,656 --> 00:24:25,457
Stop laughing, you're dead.

599
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,659
Great. Tase her titties.
Good.

600
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,660
-Well put.
-Thank you.

601
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,329
Luckily my character

602
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,097
is supposed to be concerned
and confused,

603
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:33,999
because I'm both
of those things.

604
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,601
Okay, this is the last take.

605
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:37,302
And action.

606
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:39,505
Oh, you a big bitch.
I gotta get you twice.

607
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:43,776
And that's a wrap.

608
00:24:43,777 --> 00:24:46,044
That was quite a journey.

609
00:24:46,045 --> 00:24:47,479
That means this could go
either way, y'all.

610
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,015
Oh, God.

611
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,483
I think we're in trouble.

612
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,718
Thank you.

613
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,186
I hope the other team did bad.

614
00:24:58,223 --> 00:24:59,625
You better come through, girl.

615
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:02,661
Let's get this party started.

616
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:05,697
It's elimination day,
and I'm feeling very confident.

617
00:25:05,698 --> 00:25:07,399
So this is going to be

618
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,836
a nice either validation
or wakeup call.

619
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,041
Girl, what are you doing?

620
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,377
I'm trying
something different.

621
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:19,445
-Girl, you look like--
-I'm about to go contour

622
00:25:19,446 --> 00:25:21,513
with blue and turquoises
and all of that,

623
00:25:21,514 --> 00:25:23,449
then put like a gold forehead.

624
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,051
Oh, 'cause, girl, I'm over here
confused as hell.

625
00:25:26,052 --> 00:25:28,253
I'm confused, too,
until I get it together, bitch.

626
00:25:28,254 --> 00:25:29,988
That's why I said
I need all this time.

627
00:25:29,989 --> 00:25:31,824
♪ Oh, give me
some chicken wings ♪

628
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:36,028
How do you feel about
what Ru brought up,

629
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:38,197
you know, with the other girls
talking about

630
00:25:38,198 --> 00:25:40,332
how loud and rambunctious
you are?

631
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,201
[Silky] I'm gonna let
y'all bitches know,

632
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:44,036
I'm gonna be here,
I'm gonna be loud as hell.

633
00:25:44,037 --> 00:25:45,037
Fuck you all.

634
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:46,605
[all laugh]

635
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:49,575
I'm ready to figure out
who said that shit

636
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:51,310
to come forward.

637
00:25:51,311 --> 00:25:52,778
Brooke Lynn, I got a question
for your team, bitch.

638
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,246
[Brooke Lynn] Go.

639
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,348
[Silky]
So which one of you bitches

640
00:25:56,349 --> 00:25:57,549
was the one
that said it about me?

641
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,385
Y'all legit.

642
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,554
Because everyone's
being quiet about it.

643
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:04,089
-Right.
-Said what?

644
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,557
Was the one who threw her name
out to fucking Ru.

645
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:08,026
I did.

646
00:26:08,027 --> 00:26:09,428
I knew it was you, bitch.

647
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:11,063
I'm not gonna lie to you.

648
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:12,731
[Yvie] No, it's just
everybody else on your team

649
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:13,999
was being all cute
and quiet about it.

650
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,534
But why would you say that
about me?

651
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,536
You know, I'm feeling
a little bit overwhelmed,

652
00:26:17,537 --> 00:26:19,438
because I'm the only one
that admitted it.

653
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:22,207
Anybody else, like,
y'all said shit, too,

654
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:25,244
but, okay, let me be--
let me be the villain.

655
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:26,144
The way it came off
was just like

656
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:28,547
I'm a loud, obnoxious person,

657
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:31,183
and I'm not gonna allow
my team to speak.

658
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:33,185
You do have a big personality,
and you know that.

659
00:26:33,186 --> 00:26:34,353
I do.

660
00:26:34,354 --> 00:26:35,754
And I'm saying
I was curious to see

661
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,222
how that was going to mix
in a teamwork environment.

662
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:38,991
That's--that's it.

663
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,592
That's the Tee. Thank
you for speaking up, Ariel.

664
00:26:40,593 --> 00:26:42,761
The rest of y'all need
to step your pussies up.

665
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:44,363
No, but I think we all agreed.

666
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:45,631
Whether or not you agreed--

667
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,165
if you agreed then
fucking speak up about it.

668
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:49,268
If you have enough balls
to tell Ru,

669
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:51,203
then tell Silky
to her goddamn face.

670
00:26:51,204 --> 00:26:53,405
Hey, so, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

671
00:26:53,406 --> 00:26:56,074
I'm not liking
this energy at all.

672
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:57,776
Instead of asking
everybody else

673
00:26:57,777 --> 00:26:59,578
and then going off
about this shit

674
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:00,512
that you know nothing about.

675
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,014
-Uh-huh.
-Bitch, like--

676
00:27:02,015 --> 00:27:03,315
It's not that I don't know
nothing about it.

677
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:05,150
I've heard it from
half of y'all anyways, so...

678
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:09,221
I am shook that Yvie
has come for me.

679
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:12,424
She messing with
the absolute wrong bitch.

680
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,192
The bitch in the room
that you don't mess with

681
00:27:14,193 --> 00:27:15,627
and don't fuck with is me.

682
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:17,162
Put that shit on ice.

683
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:19,231
Girl, you better
your own self on ice.

684
00:27:19,232 --> 00:27:21,066
Better focus on
this goddamn challenge.

685
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:22,601
Oh, I'm focused, boo.

686
00:27:22,602 --> 00:27:24,269
Your makeup says otherwise.

687
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,572
Ooh. Girl.

688
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:31,577
Not only does she attack me,
she attacks my makeup.

689
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:33,212
Now, bitch.

690
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:35,080
Girl, Miss Yvie,
look at yourself and then ask--

691
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,015
say whose makeup is doing what?

692
00:27:37,016 --> 00:27:38,450
Right, you need to focus.

693
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:40,085
Bitch, you are
sitting over there

694
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:42,187
rubbing gray paint on your face.

695
00:27:42,188 --> 00:27:45,290
Uh, have you ever seen somebody
finger-paint with their feet?

696
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,392
That's Yvie's mug.

697
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,027
Focus on that blending, boo.

698
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,028
Bitch, I don't know
you're talking about.

699
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,029
Focus on that blending.

700
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,030
She's a goddess.

701
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:53,432
No, bitch, you can never.

702
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:55,767
A girl that looks like you,
smells like you,

703
00:27:55,768 --> 00:27:58,270
acts like you, no, ma'am.

704
00:27:58,271 --> 00:28:00,005
An ugly girl can never come
for a pretty girl.

705
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:03,041
No, it's an ugly bitch like you

706
00:28:03,042 --> 00:28:05,510
crawling out of the swamp
to come for me?

707
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:06,678
Mm-mm, girl, I'm over it.

708
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,082
Bitch, I gotta go
put on a beauty mug.

709
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:11,316
I don't know what the fuck
I was thinking.

710
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,554
I don't know what
you were thinking. Fuck.

711
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:18,624
Whatever it was
definitely ain't working.

712
00:28:23,261 --> 00:28:25,364
So who all has traveled
for pageants?

713
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:27,032
I've traveled a lot
for pageantry.

714
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:28,634
I did a pageant in Memphis.

715
00:28:28,635 --> 00:28:30,502
I did pageants in Nashville.

716
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,605
I did pageants
in Mississippi.

717
00:28:33,606 --> 00:28:35,240
I used to travel a lot.

718
00:28:35,241 --> 00:28:37,743
It was just like
so hard for me to fly

719
00:28:37,744 --> 00:28:41,713
that I ended up like I used to
drive state to state for shows.

720
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,582
You know what my problem was?

721
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:45,317
Why they put me
on a no-flight list?

722
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:47,986
Like, girl, I couldn't fly.

723
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,221
You're on the no-fly list?

724
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:51,990
I used to be
for the longest time.

725
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:52,991
Bitch, are you kidding me?

726
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,993
-Seriously.
-Why?

727
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,228
My name, and you know,

728
00:28:56,229 --> 00:28:58,363
especially what's going on
now these days.

729
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:02,267
Oh, you mean some cute, casual,
societally built-in racism?

730
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:05,137
I'm originally
from Mombasa, Kenya,

731
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:07,606
and my name sounds Muslim,

732
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:10,342
so they put me
on the watch list.

733
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:13,011
And I was like,
I'm a drag queen.

734
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:15,180
Like, what you think
I'm gonna do?

735
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,482
It was just--it was just
so hard getting--

736
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:20,318
On top of that, my body
gave out one time, girl--

737
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,720
Your body gave out?

738
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:24,623
Yeah, girl, like, not getting
enough rest and stuff.

739
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:27,159
Bitch, I had a stroke
in the middle of a pageant.

740
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,660
What?

741
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:30,128
And then I ended up
being in a wheelchair.

742
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,530
Like, I had to take off
from shows.

743
00:29:31,531 --> 00:29:32,531
Oh, girl, now
I ain't know it was that bad.

744
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,566
Like, I couldn't walk.

745
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:37,335
Because I couldn't fly,
I was on the road all the time,

746
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,438
and so my body
couldn't take it anymore.

747
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:41,039
I was in a wheelchair.

748
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,375
I lost the whole feeling
on my right side.

749
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:46,745
It was scary.

750
00:29:46,746 --> 00:29:48,980
I had to hide from social media.

751
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:51,650
I didn't want people
to see me in public, like...

752
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,357
It was just like
literally so hard.

753
00:29:59,358 --> 00:30:02,394
I was like, what did I do,
like, you know?

754
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:08,233
Being an immigrant
in the U.S. is hard.

755
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,669
It's really, really hard.

756
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:14,406
I cannot believe
that we have a man in office

757
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:17,442
who thinks that it's okay
to try and block out more people

758
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:18,810
who bring more culture
to this place.

759
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:23,381
All right, now let's start
talking about our cysts.

760
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:26,184
Bring cyst back.

761
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:29,755
Bring back my cyster.

762
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:32,057
Oh, my God.

763
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:33,358
I don't know what this is.
I popped it.

767
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:58,650
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

768
00:30:58,651 --> 00:31:02,120
Now in 3D,
it's Michelle Visage.

769
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,523
Now, what was it like
directing two films?

770
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:07,993
Well, Ru, you know I'm known
for my double features.

771
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:08,894
Who do you use as a DP?

772
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:13,999
Our fabulous co-director
Ross Mathews.

773
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,333
I loved directing, Ru.

774
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:16,968
I felt like a regular
Alfred Bitchcock.

775
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:21,773
The hilarious Bobby Moynihan.

776
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:23,408
Now, have you done drag before?

777
00:31:23,409 --> 00:31:25,310
I haven't, but I do have
a drag name.

778
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:26,511
Might be a little un-PC,

779
00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:28,346
but I think I would go
with Fatti LuPone.

780
00:31:28,347 --> 00:31:31,116
Fatti LuPone, oh, my God.

781
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:31,783
Either Fatti LuPone
or Better Midler.

782
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,155
From Glow and Black Panther,
Sydelle Noel.

783
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:39,591
Dragkanda forever, Ru.

Don't you mean whomp-whomp?

785
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,063
This week we challenged
our queens

786
00:31:45,064 --> 00:31:49,067
to over-act in two
breakthrough feature films.

787
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:51,703
And on the runway,
category is

788
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,171
What's Your Sign?

789
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:56,107
Gentlemen, start your engines,

790
00:31:56,108 --> 00:31:58,109
and may the best woman win.

791
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:02,180
♪ We got a mighty love ♪

792
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:05,116
Category is What's Your Sign?

793
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:08,486
First up,
Brooke Lynn Hytes, Pisces.

794
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:10,655
This makes me
wanna rent Splash.

795
00:32:10,656 --> 00:32:12,624
Oh, my cod.

796
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:15,093
I may not be feeling confident
about the challenge,

797
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:16,628
but I feel really confident
in my runway.

798
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:19,264
I have two koi fish
swimming across my chest,

799
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:22,067
and this giant neckpiece
that's all water.

800
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:23,168
It's really uncomfortable
to be in,

801
00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:25,036
but I look fucking good.

802
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:26,571
She's totally shellfish.

803
00:32:28,273 --> 00:32:31,243
Plastique Tiara, Aries.

804
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:33,478
I love that she
just kept her knees hairy.

805
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,113
People don't do that anymore.

806
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:36,615
-We don't.
-No, they don't.

807
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,483
Last time I gave them
just a pretty runway,

808
00:32:38,484 --> 00:32:41,786
but this time I decided
to go sexy, seductive.

809
00:32:41,787 --> 00:32:44,756
I look the best.
I smell the best.

810
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,558
This is my runway.

811
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,093
This is the hostess
at every restaurant

812
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:50,395
-in Game of Thrones.
-Yes.

813
00:32:50,396 --> 00:32:52,330
Today, mutton.
Tomorrow, muttoned.

814
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:57,369
Ra'Jah O'Hara, Capricorn.

815
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,770
Capricorn is a what?
It's a ram?

816
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:00,272
It's a ram poodle.

817
00:33:00,273 --> 00:33:02,340
Capricorn sign

818
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:04,476
is a mixture
of a goat and a fish.

819
00:33:04,477 --> 00:33:06,745
The mug was right,
the hair was tight.

820
00:33:06,746 --> 00:33:08,446
Goats are very agile,

821
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:10,448
and that's very much
my personality.

822
00:33:10,449 --> 00:33:12,217
I thrive in rough terrain.

823
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:14,753
I believe that's
a Jean-Paul Goat-ier.

824
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:16,621
Oh, no, you didn't.

825
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:19,057
Goated it.

826
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:21,726
Nina West, Leo.

827
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:23,662
Her fire's on pussy.

828
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:27,465
I decided
to really be inspired

829
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:29,200
by the mane of a lion

830
00:33:29,201 --> 00:33:32,537
and show the judges that
I am this fiery competitor.

831
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:34,572
As a lion, I've killed before,
and I will kill again.

832
00:33:36,274 --> 00:33:38,276
Stop re-lion
on that body.

833
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:43,081
Honey Davenport, Leo.

834
00:33:43,082 --> 00:33:45,083
I've heard of a brown noser,
but this is ridiculous.

835
00:33:46,685 --> 00:33:49,120
I'm serving it
like as if Diana Ross

836
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:51,089
was the lion in The Wiz.

837
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:56,061
You can see every inch of this
fully rhinestoned lion goddess.

838
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:58,763
Brings a whole
new meaning to the mane stage.

839
00:33:58,764 --> 00:34:00,565
The lion sleeps around.

840
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,569
Shuga Cain, "Scorpico."

841
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,639
That girl is poison.

842
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,641
This outfit is all me,

843
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:11,609
because I want to serve body,
I want it like tight,

844
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,111
I want to feel that sexy vibe.

845
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:14,579
I'm a little dark
and mysterious

846
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,614
and a little scary.

847
00:34:15,615 --> 00:34:17,349
You better watch out.

848
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:19,451
Now we know
where Jane Child went.

849
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:21,953
Thank you.
It's a nineties reference.

850
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:26,625
Ariel Versace, Aries.

851
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:29,494
She's the purple sheep
of the family.

852
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:32,130
A unicorn and a ram
walk into a bar

853
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,598
and the rest is history.

854
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,434
I'm an Aries, so I'm loud,
obnoxious, and crazy.

855
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:38,403
My runway looks
are always going to be fun,

856
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:39,704
over the top,
and definitely me.

857
00:34:39,705 --> 00:34:41,439
I'm living.

858
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,510
Ewe better werk.
E-W-E--

859
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:47,545
-You write it out, yeah.
-Write it down.

860
00:34:47,546 --> 00:34:51,182
When you get home,
you're going to laugh.

861
00:34:51,183 --> 00:34:54,686
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,
Capricorn.

862
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:56,421
I call this
my goat of many colors.

863
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:01,559
I'm giving you
deep-fried catfish

864
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,696
with a side of potato salad,
baked beans,

865
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:07,232
and a tall glass of sweet tea.

866
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,100
That's what I'm serving
on the runway today, baby.

867
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,535
I am just simply in love.

868
00:35:10,536 --> 00:35:12,570
I don't think
you're yeti for this jelly.

869
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,672
-Uh-uh.
-Definitely not.

870
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:16,174
Capri-corn?

871
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:17,308
I don't remember
having Capri-corn.

872
00:35:18,576 --> 00:35:20,645
Yvie Oddly, Leo.

873
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:23,715
Rum Tum Tugger,
the early years.

874
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:27,719
My look is this digital
lion quintessential Yvie.

875
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,621
I'm showing
an attention to detail

876
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:31,322
with all my little bits
and gadgets

877
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:34,325
and broken pieces of computers.

878
00:35:34,326 --> 00:35:35,727
This lion
is my digital fantasy.

879
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,328
I did not know
they were filming Avatar.

880
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:40,565
Her litter box is filthy.

881
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,736
Beep, beep, beep.

882
00:35:44,737 --> 00:35:48,039
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo,
Libra.

883
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,041
Now this is a balanced look.

884
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,042
Hey, Vanjie,
how's it hanging?

885
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:52,343
Well hung.

886
00:35:52,344 --> 00:35:54,679
I'm giving you
flower girl realness.

887
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,216
I gotta balance these fucking
red roses on my head.

888
00:35:58,217 --> 00:35:59,517
I hot glued that bitch.

889
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:02,187
Ooh, my God,
I can feel the pain,

890
00:36:02,188 --> 00:36:03,521
but, baby,
that's what you have to do.

891
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:04,622
She has rosen.

892
00:36:06,658 --> 00:36:11,362
A'Keria C. Davenport,
Pisces.

893
00:36:11,363 --> 00:36:13,932
On a scale of one to five,
I give this an Omega 3.

894
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:17,535
Clearly I'm a fish.

895
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,404
My body is still
a little claustrophobic.

896
00:36:19,405 --> 00:36:21,506
I'm usually about showing
my body-ody.

897
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:23,074
I just wanted
to show the judges

898
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:25,443
that, you know, she's not
always that sex kitten.

899
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,612
She can give you variety.

900
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:29,981
She's all about that bass,
about that bass.

901
00:36:29,982 --> 00:36:31,216
Fish, fish, fish.

902
00:36:33,017 --> 00:36:36,321
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

903
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:38,156
She really knows
how to handle her weapon.

904
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:40,225
Shoot that poison arrow.

905
00:36:40,226 --> 00:36:42,127
Girl, I'm gonna show you

906
00:36:42,128 --> 00:36:44,362
how Mercedes owns this stage.

907
00:36:44,363 --> 00:36:47,499
I am giving you this big hair.

908
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,168
And, bitch, I'm from the
jungles, don't forget that.

909
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:51,169
She does make a point.

910
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,370
Duck, Michelle, duck.

911
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,508
Kahanna Montrese, Aries.

912
00:36:56,509 --> 00:36:58,343
Ram tough.

913
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,245
Yes, she is.

914
00:37:00,246 --> 00:37:01,679
I'm really trying
to channel Tyra Banks,

915
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,015
because I'm feeling
like top model fish.

916
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,084
I am moving this chiffon
around the stage.

917
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:10,488
Okay. Well, bitch,
there goes that moment.

918
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:12,724
Wham, bam, thank you, ram.

919
00:37:15,627 --> 00:37:17,996
Scarlet Envy, Pisces.

920
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:19,998
I hate to burst your bubble,

921
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:21,699
but you're blowing it.

922
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,334
I don't remember
Frozen being like this.

923
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:29,073
I am a Pieces goddess
directly from the sea,

924
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:31,376
right into your heart.

925
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:36,314
She is giving you waves
of fluid, beautiful glitter.

926
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:37,649
Call me bubbles, darling.

927
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,516
Everybody does.

928
00:37:40,084 --> 00:37:41,553
In honor of Michael Jackson.

929
00:37:41,554 --> 00:37:42,921
-Bubbles.
-Bubbles.

930
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:47,225
It's time
for Team Brooke Lynn Hytes

931
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,360
and the global premiere

932
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:51,963
of Why It Gotta Be Black,
Panther?

933
00:37:55,366 --> 00:37:58,269
Nails, I just got
my DNA test results,

934
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,407
and, bitch, I'm 50%
Dragkanda royalty,

935
00:38:02,408 --> 00:38:04,576
and I didn't even know
that was a real place.

936
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:06,077
Oh, honey.

937
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,246
Dragkanda
is this mystical place

938
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:10,114
where drag queens run free.

939
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:11,950
But how do we get there?

940
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:12,951
I know a way.

941
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:14,385
And when we get inside,

942
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:17,121
you can take
the rightful place as queen,

943
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:19,090
and I will become rich.

944
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,625
Rich, I say!

945
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:24,662
-Next hand.
-Bitch!

946
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:26,164
You know I only got one hand,

947
00:38:26,165 --> 00:38:27,565
and I'll cut you with it!

948
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:34,606
Deep within the dunes
of Fire Island

949
00:38:34,607 --> 00:38:36,107
lies the world's

950
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:40,378
most technologically advanced
civilization: Dragkanda.

951
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:44,515
Powered by charismium,
this great drag nation is ruled

952
00:38:44,516 --> 00:38:48,987
by my drag daughter,
the whitest Black Panther.

953
00:38:48,988 --> 00:38:51,489
Excuse me,
but we can't say Black Panther.

954
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,024
Copyright issue.

955
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:56,094
How about Pink Panther?

956
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:57,195
-Oh, my God, I love pink.
-No, try again.

957
00:38:57,196 --> 00:38:59,030
Purple Panther?

958
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:01,065
Yes! I love the color purple.

959
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:03,034
Oprah was right.

960
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:05,303
Listen.
Enemy forces are coming

961
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:08,339
to threaten the...
Purple Panther.

962
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,474
Oh, my God.

963
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:11,509
And undermine
our drag way of life.

964
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,645
BeBe Zaharaaaah!

965
00:39:13,646 --> 00:39:16,681
Ra-ka-ta-titi-ta-ta.

966
00:39:16,682 --> 00:39:17,782
Wrong movie, ma'am.

967
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:22,120
To harness your pussy power,

968
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:25,056
you must smoke this mystical
charismium flower.

969
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:27,859
Exhale, baby, exhale.

970
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:36,567
What?
It's legal in Dragkanda.

971
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:44,042
Oh, my God, Great Aunt Max'ine,
is that you?

972
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:46,544
There is a rival panther
coming for your crown.

973
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:48,980
Beyoncé what?

974
00:39:48,981 --> 00:39:53,351
You have a half-drag sister,
and, bitch, she is from Chicago.

975
00:39:53,352 --> 00:39:56,654
I don't start drama,
but I definitely finish it.

976
00:39:56,655 --> 00:40:01,592
You need to get some gadgets
from your sister Sissy, honey.

977
00:40:01,593 --> 00:40:04,829
If you stay woke,
you won't have to get woke.

978
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:10,601
Whoo-hoo! Damn,
that is some good shit.

979
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:16,407
Sissy, our half-sister
Chicago Panther

980
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:18,710
is coming to try
to snatch my crown.

981
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,011
I need your help.

982
00:40:20,012 --> 00:40:22,280
Chicago Panther?

983
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:23,781
Oh, I follow her on Instagram.

984
00:40:23,782 --> 00:40:27,452
Clearly she got
the looks in the family.

985
00:40:27,453 --> 00:40:28,753
Can we move on?

986
00:40:28,754 --> 00:40:31,356
These killer heels,

987
00:40:31,357 --> 00:40:33,491
well, girl,
they will make your booty pop.

988
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:35,660
Absolutely not.

989
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:37,328
Now here they are.

990
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:40,631
These tactical tucking panties.

991
00:40:40,632 --> 00:40:45,103
These have the ability to absorb
even the strongest of shade,

992
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:50,041
and then clapback with
the intensity of 10.000 reads!

993
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:50,908
Yes!

994
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:57,548
Chicago Panther and Nails
have breached the panty shields.

995
00:40:57,549 --> 00:40:58,516
I think they're coming.

996
00:41:00,718 --> 00:41:04,655
Not only am I the legitimate
heir to the throne of Dragkanda,

997
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:06,657
I'm also legitimately hotter.

998
00:41:06,658 --> 00:41:08,426
Everybody says so.

999
00:41:08,427 --> 00:41:10,194
Right, Nails?

1000
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:12,130
Whatever you say, Chicago.

1001
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:14,499
But now I can get my hands--

1002
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,203
I mean, hand, on
the all-powerful charisminum.

1003
00:41:19,204 --> 00:41:23,074
Hey, Nails.
You ready to lose another arm?

1004
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:26,577
Oh, honey, I can fight you with
one hand tied behind my back.

1005
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:30,481
Now give me the charisminum
or feel my wrath.

1006
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:35,520
We will fight you to the death
Dragkanda style.

1007
00:41:37,155 --> 00:41:39,457
Purple Panther, you're so ugly

1008
00:41:39,458 --> 00:41:41,726
your family had to tie
a pork chop around your neck

1009
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:42,794
for the dog to play with you.

1010
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:44,295
Ho, is you a squirrel?

1011
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:47,632
Because your cheeks
are full of nuts.

1012
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:50,034
Your shade is just
too intense for me.

1013
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:57,275
How come I ain't got
no dialogue in this scene?

1014
00:41:57,276 --> 00:41:59,510
Reclaiming my lines.

1015
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:01,446
Reclaiming my lines.

1016
00:42:07,151 --> 00:42:11,689
Next up,
Team Silky Nutmeg Ganache

1017
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:16,027
and the global premiere
of Good God Girl, Get Out!

1018
00:42:19,197 --> 00:42:20,765
Marnie, we're driving

1019
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:24,502
all the way to your
heterosexual parents' house.

1020
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:27,205
But do they know
I'm a drag queen?

1021
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,674
Oh, Christine,
they're gonna love you.

1022
00:42:29,675 --> 00:42:31,642
They love me, don't they?

1023
00:42:31,643 --> 00:42:34,312
Yeah, but you're definitely
not a drag queen.

1024
00:42:34,313 --> 00:42:35,546
I know.

1025
00:42:35,547 --> 00:42:38,449
I'm just a plain old
hetero-normative girl.

1026
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,818
But all of my best friends
have been drag queens.

1027
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,129
Was that--

1028
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,332
An eerie foreshadowing
of something to come?

1029
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:58,035
No, I think
that was Derrick Barry.

1030
00:42:58,036 --> 00:43:00,671
Good God, girl, get--

1031
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,182
Hello, hello, hello,
Christine.

1032
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:13,551
I'm no regular dad.
I'm a cool dad.

1033
00:43:13,552 --> 00:43:15,219
I watch Drag Race every night

1034
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,188
and I've been to DragCon
three times.

1035
00:43:17,189 --> 00:43:18,623
Okurr-ka-ka-ka-kurrr?

1036
00:43:18,624 --> 00:43:20,324
As a psychologist,

1037
00:43:20,325 --> 00:43:23,060
I found that Vivian
Mahogany Davenport's

1038
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:24,595
new panel discussion

1039
00:43:24,596 --> 00:43:27,298
on the new movement
of soft sculpture

1040
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:29,467
is truly fascinating.

1041
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:32,670
Oh, I'm sorry my parents
are being so weird.

1042
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:37,408
They're definitely not trying
to plot something bad.

1043
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:40,278
What? No, I don't think
anything's weird.

1044
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,015
Upulence!

1045
00:43:44,016 --> 00:43:46,684
You own everything.

1046
00:43:46,685 --> 00:43:48,486
Touch this skin.

1047
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:51,822
Touch all this skin, bro.

1048
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:56,427
Okay, that was weird.

1049
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:59,697
Oh, no, they're the drag queens
who work for us.

1050
00:43:59,698 --> 00:44:04,235
And they're definitely
not my grandparents.

1051
00:44:04,236 --> 00:44:06,571
♪ Guess who's back
in the house? ♪

1052
00:44:06,572 --> 00:44:08,506
♪ Guess who's back
in the house? ♪

1053
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:10,608
New phone. Who's this?

1054
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:13,578
It's your best friend
Rhonda from the DMV.

1055
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,481
Excuse me, can't you see
I'm on my lunch break?

1056
00:44:17,482 --> 00:44:19,650
So they haven't killed you yet?

1057
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:22,253
I think they like me.

1058
00:44:22,254 --> 00:44:24,422
Don't you watch
scary movies?

1059
00:44:24,423 --> 00:44:27,258
The drag queen is always
the first to be murdered.

1060
00:44:27,259 --> 00:44:29,527
I'm pretty sure
it's the black guy.

1061
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:32,430
Oh, time for dinner, hon.

1062
00:44:32,431 --> 00:44:34,332
Ready to be served?

1063
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:35,299
Who dat?

1064
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,072
Hi-ee.

1065
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,743
Leave while you still can.

1066
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:47,778
What did you say to her,
little girl?

1067
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:49,680
I'm so not a man.

1068
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:52,450
-Sashay away.
-What was that?

1069
00:44:52,451 --> 00:44:54,585
I just asked her
if she would like some eggs.

1070
00:44:54,586 --> 00:44:57,321
Oh, no, thank you.
I brought my own hot sauce.

1071
00:44:57,322 --> 00:45:00,324
Good God, girl, get out!

1072
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:01,626
Hold that thought.

1073
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:03,427
I gotta get this.

1074
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:04,762
Who's this?

1075
00:45:04,763 --> 00:45:08,666
Oh, thank God, girl,
they haven't killed you yet.

1076
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:10,301
Girl, listen.

1077
00:45:10,302 --> 00:45:12,169
According to my DMV database,

1078
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,537
drag queens have been
coming up missing

1079
00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:16,040
for the past 11 seasons.

1080
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:19,644
Like, falling off social media,
canceling gigs.

1081
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:22,680
Marnie's family is a part
of some secret society

1082
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:26,517
that kidnaps, brainwashes, and
trades places with drag queens.

1083
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:30,021
Like, Christine, like,
you in danger, girl.

1084
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,389
Time to go, Christine.

1085
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,432
Would you like some tea,
Christine?

1086
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:44,535
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not thirsty.

1087
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:47,405
I've never met a queen
that didn't like tea.

1088
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:48,606
What's the tea?

1089
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:50,474
What's the tea?

1090
00:45:50,475 --> 00:45:51,809
What's the Tee?

1091
00:45:53,444 --> 00:45:55,446
Bitch, please--

1092
00:45:55,447 --> 00:46:01,218
Now the time has come for you
to sink, sink, sink, sink.

1093
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:04,088
Now you're in
the between-me-down-there.

1094
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:06,090
That's how you say it, right?

1095
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:07,992
You're paralyzed, Christine.

1096
00:46:07,993 --> 00:46:11,996
Like when Valentina didn't
know the words to Greedy.

1097
00:46:13,698 --> 00:46:17,068
OMG! What's happening?

1098
00:46:17,069 --> 00:46:20,271
Girl, you haven't realized
by now what's going on?

1099
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:23,107
This whole entire movie
is a metaphor

1100
00:46:23,108 --> 00:46:27,344
on mainstream society's
appropriation of drag culture.

1101
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:32,683
Now I'm gonna put the snatch
in body-ody-ody snatcher.

1102
00:46:32,684 --> 00:46:34,752
Wait!

1103
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,288
I recognize that sound.

1104
00:46:37,289 --> 00:46:40,224
Step away from
the mother clucking drag queen.

1105
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:42,693
Oh, that fan
ain't gonna stop us.

1106
00:46:42,694 --> 00:46:44,695
No, bitch,
but my DMV-issue taser will.

1107
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,168
Oh, you a big bitch.
I gotta get you twice.

1108
00:46:53,637 --> 00:46:57,608
Yes, bitch!
But how did you know?

1109
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:00,311
At the DMV, oh, bitch,
we get shit done.

1110
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:04,115
Actually, you guys
don't really get anything done.

1111
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:06,317
Shut up, bitch.
Let's go.

1112
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:07,885
'Cause I'm still on
my motherfucking lunch break.

1113
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:15,092
Wow.

1114
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:18,028
Ladies,
I've made some decisions.

1115
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:23,234
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1116
00:47:23,235 --> 00:47:24,034
Nina West.

1117
00:47:25,703 --> 00:47:28,572
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1118
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:31,642
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1119
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:33,344
Honey Davenport.

1120
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:36,680
A'Keria C. Davenport.

1121
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:39,483
Ra'Jah O'Hara.

1122
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:42,419
You are safe.

1123
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:47,258
You may leave the stage.

1124
00:47:52,096 --> 00:47:54,598
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1125
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,502
starting with Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1126
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:01,205
I love this outfit.
I think it's like one of my top.

1127
00:48:01,206 --> 00:48:04,975
As far as your performance goes,
it was only one note.

1128
00:48:04,976 --> 00:48:06,310
Oh, my God.

1129
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:08,045
So it kind of flatlined.

1130
00:48:08,046 --> 00:48:10,614
I was actually on the set.
I was incog-Negro.

1131
00:48:12,616 --> 00:48:14,185
Watching you guys,

1132
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:15,219
and one of the notes
that Michelle gave you

1133
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,289
was "Beyoncé what?" line.

1134
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:19,957
And I never heard you
nail that one.

1135
00:48:19,958 --> 00:48:21,125
Let me hear you say it.

1136
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:23,327
Beyoncé what?

1137
00:48:23,328 --> 00:48:25,596
A little bit more.
'Cause the joke is "say what?"

1138
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:27,998
-Beyoncé what?
-There you go.

1139
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:28,666
Eight times the charm.

1140
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,668
Well, you know.

1141
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:32,536
Plastique Tiara.

1142
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:35,306
Tonight on the runway
you look stunning.

1143
00:48:35,307 --> 00:48:37,641
I wish, however, you weren't
wearing the same boots

1144
00:48:37,642 --> 00:48:39,577
that you had on in the thing.

1145
00:48:39,578 --> 00:48:42,112
I thought you were a standout
in the video.

1146
00:48:42,113 --> 00:48:44,281
-Rich, I say!
-Absolutely hilarious.

1147
00:48:44,282 --> 00:48:45,716
You were a scene-stealer.

1148
00:48:45,717 --> 00:48:47,484
Every time you said a line,
I was laughing.

1149
00:48:47,485 --> 00:48:50,354
This is a good season
of Drag Race.

1150
00:48:50,355 --> 00:48:51,589
I'm in love with you all
already.

1151
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,490
That will go in the promo.

1152
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:59,363
Up next, Shuga Cain, "Scorpico."

1153
00:48:59,364 --> 00:49:01,232
You look beautiful.
Your makeup is stunning.

1154
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:04,201
But I could not tell you
that you're a Scorpio.

1155
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:07,404
Literally, I got no Scorpio.

1156
00:49:07,405 --> 00:49:10,674
But your performance
as Auntie Max'ine--

1157
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:13,544
That is some good shit.

1158
00:49:13,545 --> 00:49:15,179
You blew me away.

1159
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,714
Your job is to come in,
knock it out of the park,

1160
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:17,715
and get out of there.

1161
00:49:17,716 --> 00:49:18,549
You did that perfectly.

1162
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,017
Thank you.

1163
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:22,319
Up next, Ariel Versace.

1164
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,488
I love this look.
It's just so sweet.

1165
00:49:24,489 --> 00:49:26,323
I will say it didn't make sense
for you to pick your shirt up

1166
00:49:26,324 --> 00:49:27,725
when you were
all the way back there

1167
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:29,360
and we could barely see it.

1168
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:31,028
Okay.

1169
00:49:31,029 --> 00:49:32,529
In the challenge, I feel like
I could see you in your head.

1170
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,098
You could see you
trying to get to your moment.

1171
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,735
It was a little clunky,
your timing together.

1172
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:41,138
Up next, Scarlet Envy.

1173
00:49:41,139 --> 00:49:42,473
I really love the fact

1174
00:49:42,474 --> 00:49:45,209
that you contoured your breasts
with turquoise.

1175
00:49:46,677 --> 00:49:48,212
That's amazing.

1176
00:49:48,213 --> 00:49:50,114
I've been watching this show
for a long time,

1177
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,682
and I don't think I've seen
anyone come out with bubbles.

1178
00:49:51,683 --> 00:49:53,384
That was a genius idea.

1179
00:49:53,385 --> 00:49:54,752
That part that you played,

1180
00:49:54,753 --> 00:49:57,621
a lot of people play that
sort of, "Oh, I'm in peril!

1181
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:00,691
What do I do?" thing
at this level the whole time.

1182
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:01,892
And I'm already annoyed
with myself.

1183
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:05,429
What you were able to do

1184
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,464
was find peaks and valleys
in the performance.

1185
00:50:07,465 --> 00:50:11,302
I didn't know
how much you had to offer.

1186
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,469
I just want to say
I was chosen last.

1187
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:13,671
Yeah, she was, fuck.

1188
00:50:13,672 --> 00:50:17,074
And that shook me.

1189
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,075
I really enjoyed it.
Nice work.

1190
00:50:18,076 --> 00:50:19,076
Thank you.

1191
00:50:19,077 --> 00:50:21,679
Up next, Yvie Oddly.

1192
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,647
Your acting, superb.

1193
00:50:23,648 --> 00:50:27,251
It was fun to work with someone
with such passion for it.

1194
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:28,252
Thank you.

1195
00:50:28,253 --> 00:50:30,220
You two have good chemistry.

1196
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:32,356
You guys work well together.

1197
00:50:32,357 --> 00:50:34,725
And Yvie Oddly, you are weird
and you are fierce

1198
00:50:34,726 --> 00:50:36,226
and I love it.

1199
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:37,361
Yeah,
and out of all the runways,

1200
00:50:37,362 --> 00:50:39,263
yours was the best,
most committed.

1201
00:50:39,264 --> 00:50:42,366
As a fan of the show,
I can't wait to see what you do.

1202
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:46,303
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

1203
00:50:46,304 --> 00:50:50,174
Your outfit, um, compared to
what I'm seeing on this stage,

1204
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,176
it just really fell flat for me.

1205
00:50:52,177 --> 00:50:53,177
You have to kick it up a notch.

1206
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,244
Okay.

1207
00:50:54,245 --> 00:50:56,447
-Your performance.
-Upulence.

1208
00:50:56,448 --> 00:50:58,515
Sometimes when I was trying
to get you to say opulence,

1209
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:01,318
it really sounded like you
were saying upland.

1210
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:02,419
Like Upland, California.

1211
00:51:06,223 --> 00:51:09,994
I feel amongst these girls that
you get quiet and I lose you.

1212
00:51:09,995 --> 00:51:13,063
Even right now on this stage,

1213
00:51:13,064 --> 00:51:15,432
your shoulders is forward
and your hand is like this.

1214
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:17,167
You're diminishing yourself.

1215
00:51:17,168 --> 00:51:19,470
I almost feel sad for you,

1216
00:51:19,471 --> 00:51:22,006
like, maybe you don't feel
like you're worthy.

1217
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:28,712
I just don't feel comfortable.
I...

1218
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:30,681
Four years ago I had a stroke.

1219
00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:35,652
And I lost half of my body.

1220
00:51:35,653 --> 00:51:39,456
And after that, I pretend
like I'm comfortable

1221
00:51:39,457 --> 00:51:41,125
when people see me.

1222
00:51:41,126 --> 00:51:45,596
But inside, I'm like I don't
feel as pretty as I used to.

1223
00:51:46,764 --> 00:51:48,665
You are beautiful, Mercedes.

1224
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:55,472
Don't allow that saboteur
to block your blessing here.

1225
00:51:55,473 --> 00:51:58,609
Your moment is now.

1226
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,611
Thank you.

1227
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:01,845
Thanks, Mercedes.

1228
00:52:04,248 --> 00:52:05,749
Kahanna Montrese.

1229
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:09,486
Your outfit, compared to these
girls who just went for it,

1230
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:11,021
I feel like
all you pretty much did

1231
00:52:11,022 --> 00:52:13,023
was the horns
and some glitter.

1232
00:52:13,024 --> 00:52:14,691
If I can do it, then no.

1233
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:15,826
I feel like I can do that.

1234
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:21,632
On set, I saw you
trying really hard,

1235
00:52:21,633 --> 00:52:23,000
and I could really
appreciate that.

1236
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:26,136
I don't think
you got all the way there.

1237
00:52:26,137 --> 00:52:28,272
Did you and Mercedes
try to sort of

1238
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:31,008
come up with a routine
or a stunt together?

1239
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:33,777
Because your roles really
did depend on one another.

1240
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:36,513
Um, no. I was--
Maybe if I just would have

1241
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:39,616
been more in sync with her,
we would have landed it.

1242
00:52:39,617 --> 00:52:41,385
So it was
a missed opportunity,

1243
00:52:41,386 --> 00:52:42,619
because you all
felt disconnected.

1244
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,122
Yes, ma'am.

1245
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,757
Thank you, ladies.

1246
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,158
I think we've heard enough.

1247
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:50,394
While you untuck backstage,

1248
00:52:50,395 --> 00:52:52,129
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1249
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:56,700
Now just between
us squirrel friends,

1250
00:52:56,701 --> 00:52:58,035
what do you think?

1251
00:52:58,036 --> 00:52:59,503
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1252
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:02,106
For me, on the set,
the thing she didn't do

1253
00:53:02,107 --> 00:53:04,708
was be willing
to bend a little bit.

1254
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:06,543
Take after take
she did the same thing.

1255
00:53:06,544 --> 00:53:09,713
Second and third take was
an opportunity to loosen up,

1256
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:11,248
actually breathe some life
into it.

1257
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:13,150
Plastique Tiara.

1258
00:53:13,151 --> 00:53:15,719
Memorable, super-super funny.

1259
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,321
All around
really, really fantastic.

1260
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,623
If you're checking boxes
on week two,

1261
00:53:19,624 --> 00:53:21,592
you've got talent,
you've got looks.

1262
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:23,727
I'm intrigued
by what she's gonna do next.

1263
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:26,063
I mean, what more
do you want on week two?

1264
00:53:26,064 --> 00:53:27,498
Shuga Cain.

1265
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:29,766
As Auntie Max'ine,
she was a standout.

1266
00:53:29,767 --> 00:53:32,336
One of the best, if not
the best in that team.

1267
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:35,305
It was funny
take after take after take.

1268
00:53:35,306 --> 00:53:37,641
She played that auntie role.
She did. She did.

1269
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:39,476
Ariel Versace.

1270
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:41,311
Every time we gave direction,
she listened,

1271
00:53:41,312 --> 00:53:43,480
but she didn't know what to do
with the information.

1272
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:46,450
Comedy's hard, and I think
she tried as best as she could,

1273
00:53:46,451 --> 00:53:48,519
but it wasn't there yet.
I wanted more.

1274
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,521
Scarlet Envy.

1275
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:53,590
She was the most natural actress
out of all of them.

1276
00:53:53,591 --> 00:53:55,159
Scarlet is a leading lady.

1277
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,362
Yvie Oddly.

1278
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,398
I am really intrigued by her.
I love her acting.

1279
00:54:01,399 --> 00:54:02,966
I think she did
a really good job.

1280
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:03,967
I thought she was really funny.

1281
00:54:03,968 --> 00:54:05,702
I dig that vibe.
I'm a big fan.

1282
00:54:05,703 --> 00:54:07,504
Mercedes Iman Diamond.

1283
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:10,107
I do feel for her.
It's horrible what happened.

1284
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:14,545
But I feel like, use those flaws
and make it work for you.

1285
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:17,481
Look, there was no character
development in the movie.

1286
00:54:17,482 --> 00:54:19,683
I don't remember
a thing she did.

1287
00:54:19,684 --> 00:54:23,153
Also, her bow and arrow work
was--it was a lot of this.

1288
00:54:24,488 --> 00:54:26,223
It was weird.

1289
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:28,392
-Kahanna Montrese.
-I needed more

1290
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,293
than just splashing
a little glitter on your pecs.

1291
00:54:29,294 --> 00:54:30,561
The glitter on the chest

1292
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:32,229
looked like hair on her chest.

1293
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,030
-That's what I thought it was.
-Did you see that?

1294
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:34,364
It looked like hair.

1295
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:36,533
I tell you,
when we were directing her,

1296
00:54:36,534 --> 00:54:38,168
I don't think
she understood this part.

1297
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:39,303
There is something
very sweet about her.

1298
00:54:39,304 --> 00:54:42,172
I just don't know
if she's ready yet.

1299
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:45,142
Silence.
I've made my decision.

1300
00:54:45,143 --> 00:54:47,211
I'll have the tuna fish on rye.

1301
00:54:49,313 --> 00:54:50,447
Welcome back, ladies.

1302
00:54:50,448 --> 00:54:53,183
I've made some decisions.

1303
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:55,319
Shuga Cain...

1304
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,620
you're safe.

1305
00:54:56,621 --> 00:54:58,488
Thank you.

1306
00:54:58,489 --> 00:54:59,489
Plastique Tiara,

1307
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:02,359
You're safe.

1308
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,760
Thank you.

1309
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:08,365
Scarlet Envy,

1310
00:55:08,366 --> 00:55:11,969
Yvie Oddly,

1311
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,471
good God, girls, you've got it.

1312
00:55:14,472 --> 00:55:17,474
Chemistry.

1313
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:19,376
Con-drag-ulations.

1314
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:21,578
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

1315
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:26,750
You've each won
a $2.500 gift card

1316
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:28,452
from The Crème Shop.

1317
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:29,653
You may join the other girls.

1318
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:35,425
I think
I have shown these ladies

1319
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:37,294
who they're fucking with.

1320
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,232
Mercedes Iman Diamond,

1321
00:55:42,233 --> 00:55:46,003
this week, your performance
lacked sparkle.

1322
00:55:48,238 --> 00:55:49,840
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1323
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:52,743
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1324
00:55:54,211 --> 00:55:55,012
You're safe.

1325
00:55:58,215 --> 00:56:01,718
Ariel Versace,
your ram was glam,

1326
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:03,387
but your Sissy wasn't sassy.

1327
00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:09,293
Kahanna Montrese, you took
this challenge by the horns,

1328
00:56:09,294 --> 00:56:11,461
but you still seemed sheepish.

1329
00:56:15,532 --> 00:56:17,968
Kahanna Montrese,
I'm sorry, my dear,

1330
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:19,069
but you are up for elimination.

1331
00:56:21,305 --> 00:56:23,240
Ariel Versace, you are safe.

1332
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:24,508
You may join the other girls.

1333
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:25,776
Thank you.

1334
00:56:27,511 --> 00:56:29,646
Two queens stand before me.

1335
00:56:29,647 --> 00:56:34,251
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1336
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:38,088
and save yourself
from elimination.

1337
00:56:40,524 --> 00:56:42,426
The time has come...

1338
00:56:42,427 --> 00:56:44,661
for you to lip sync...

1339
00:56:44,662 --> 00:56:50,367
for your life!

1340
00:56:50,368 --> 00:56:52,536
Kahanna Montrese, this is it.

1341
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:53,704
Show the world what you got.

1342
00:56:55,238 --> 00:56:59,343
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

She was giving Toni Braxton
tease up under there.

Mercedes Iman Diamond,

1380
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:47,050
shantay, you stay.

1381
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:52,689
You may join the other girls.

1382
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:58,495
Kahanna Montrese, you are
a young queen with a big future.

1383
00:58:58,496 --> 00:59:02,132
Now go out there
and work, bitch.

1384
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:05,469
Now sashay away.

1385
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,870
Thank you guys for everything.

1386
00:59:09,406 --> 00:59:11,441
Love you, Kahanna.

1387
00:59:11,442 --> 00:59:12,576
Something's coming, bitch.

1388
00:59:12,577 --> 00:59:14,511
Something is coming.

1389
00:59:17,147 --> 00:59:19,416
It hurts to go home second.

1390
00:59:19,417 --> 00:59:22,018
Had I just had one more shot,

1391
00:59:22,019 --> 00:59:24,521
they would have got
exactly who I am.

1392
00:59:24,522 --> 00:59:26,122
That's why you gotta bring it
every single time.

1393
00:59:28,959 --> 00:59:31,661
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1394
00:59:31,662 --> 00:59:35,065

if you can't love yourself,

1395
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:37,067
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1396
00:59:37,068 --> 00:59:38,435
Can I get a whomp-whomp?

1397
00:59:38,436 --> 00:59:40,136
-Whomp-whomp.
-Whomp-whomp.

1398
00:59:40,137 --> 00:59:41,538
Now can I get an amen?

1399
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:43,440
-Amen!
-All right.

00:59:43,441 --> 00:59:44,641
