00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,795
[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

2
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,032
You need to create
a farm-to-runway look.

3
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,868
Who do you think
should go home?

4
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,136
Yvie should go home.

5
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:11,972
She's hurt,
and we ain't got time for that.

6
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,441
I'm really pissed
that Silky would say that,

7
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,577
especially when she saw me
finish that last challenge

8
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,546
on a sprained ankle.

9
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,614
Who do you think should go home?

10
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,916
Silky Ganache.

11
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,486
Why you pressed, ho?

12
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,288
[RuPaul] Ra'Jah O'Hara.

13
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,924
Tonight on the runway,
I am seeing the root.

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,292
A'Keria.

15
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,394
The shoulder pads, I hated them.

16
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:35,896
[RuPaul] Plastique Tiara.

17
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,433
Designers want you to emote
through the clothing,

18
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,567
and I really got that from you.

19
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,969
[RuPaul] Con-drag-ulations.

20
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:44,004
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

21
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,138
[applause]

22
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,841
A'Keria C. Davenport,
shantay you stay.

23
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,242
Thank you so much.

24
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,678
Ra'Jah O'Hara, sashay away.

25
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,256
Oh, my God.
I got war wounds a mile deep.

26
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,458
Whew.

27
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,728
Ra'Jah is eliminated,
and I feel so bad.

28
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,896
But I got my own struggles
right now.

29
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,167
I really don't trust Yvie
in this competition,

30
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,571
because I feel that
she view me as a threat.

31
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,573
Now, with that being said,

32
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,909
I have to keep a stern eye
on Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes.

33
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,945
For example,
Miss Brooke Lynn Hytes

34
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,681
say that I should have been
in the bottom for my runway.

35
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,849
No Tee, I thought
you were going to be

36
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,051
in the bottom this week
for this look.

37
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,553
But she let her good Judy Nina

38
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,489
go out looking
the hot donkey fool

39
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,057
and praised that bitch.

40
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:40,093
How you feeling, Yvie,
off of all of your critiques?

41
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,263
[Yvie] I got mostly
positive critiques.

42
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:44,798
I like wanted to bring
a journey to the judges

43
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,000
and show them that like
I can elevate my drag,

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,638
despite how like anyone
may or may not feel.

45
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,974
There's definitely tension.

46
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,643
It's so thick you couldn't even
cut through it with a knife.

47
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,145
You're gonna need a chainsaw.

48
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,747
Silky, what are you thinking?
You're really quiet.

49
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,450
For me as a person,
like, it's stressful.

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,985
Ultimately, I'm just
tired of the fake.

51
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,586
I'm tired of the phony.

52
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,422
Who do you feel is being fake?

53
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,458
I'm not even going to bring
that up at this moment.

54
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,193
If you're a judge, you need
to be on the judges' panel.

55
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:16,263
And that's all I got to say.

56
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:19,266
Yvie has called me talentless.

57
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,701
Talentless?

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,570
You think safe
is gonna get you somewhere?

59
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,238
Sasha Velour
was safe every week.

60
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,440
And won.

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,241
That's 'cause Sasha Velour
was talented.

62
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,977
Oh, shit.

63
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,479
Bitch, I'm from Chicago.

64
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,481
When you called me talentless,

65
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,249
I wanted to square up
with your ass.

66
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,354
Before I was trying to be
at least cordial.

67
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,323
Like I was cool with Yvie.

68
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,559
But now I know we just
need to just let it go.

69
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
Don't worry, girl.
I won't be giving you

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,061
any more unasked-for advice.

71
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,996
I'll just let you be in
the bottom if you go that way.

72
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,465
[Vanjie]
Yeah, I don't need it.

73
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,866
I mean, after just looking
at the skirt, I don't need it.

74
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,501
I was trying to help you.

75
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,502
Don't worry so much
about what I'm doing--

76
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,703
I was trying to help you, sis.

77
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,705
Being real with someone
isn't called being fake.

78
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,941
Being fake? Girl,
one minute you're being kind

79
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,676
and being cool, and that's
what I was talking about.

80
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:05,078
People have
multiple feelings, girl.

81
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,746
Just because
I'm being kind to you

82
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,215
doesn't mean I'm not allowed
to be real.

83
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,716
It ain't no feelings.
Multiple personalities.

84
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,285
So how about you shut
the fuck up with your skirt,

85
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,420
and whatever you--

86
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,622
Okay. What else
are you going to repeat?

87
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,557
Whatever I feel like
repeating, bitch.

88
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,093
So shut the fuck up
and mind your business.

89
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,362
She feels like I'm fake

90
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,531
because I was kind to her
one minute,

91
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,867
and then honest with her
the next.

92
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,803
I didn't come here to lie
and sneak around corners,

93
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,905
and I don't care
how incendiary that is.

94
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,073
That's all I gotta say.
I don't give a shit.

95
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:36,776
Guys, guys, guys.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

96
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,678
I know y'all have drama,
whatever,

97
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,814
but let's take a moment
to celebrate the fact

98
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,082
that this is
motherfucking top eight.

99
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,985
Top eight and we love you

100
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:47,220
and...and bye.

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,191
I'm kind of tired of feeling
like some villain to them,

102
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:53,560
when really I'm just
like the one bitch

103
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,861
who's telling it like it is.

104
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:58,331
Miss Vanjie
just let that bitch have it.

105

We ain't going home for no
ratchet ho that drag cost $3.00.

00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,877
[all laugh]

177
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,079
Based on true-life events

178
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,114
and a little bit of fabrication.

179
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,782
[RuPaul] Judge this book
by its cover,

180
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,285
and she will judge you
right back.

181
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:08,154
Hi. My name's Plastique Tiara.

182
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,659
Buy my new book, Personality:
Not Everybody has One.

183
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,930
[RuPaul] Oh, Eckhart Tolle,
you better watch out, honey.

184
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,898
Plastique is coming for you.

185
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:23,403
Booty Food: Confidence From
the Kitchen to the Bedroom.

186
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,840
You'll learn how to serve cakes
and eat them, too.

187
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,642
[RuPaul] Oh, you're like
the Bareback Contessa.

188
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:34,114
Odd-acity: Release Your Meek
and Get Your Freak On.

189
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,850
Go oddballs to the sugar walls.

190
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,952
Eat a baby.

191
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,321
[RuPaul] Are you there, God?

192
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,490
It's me, Crazy.

193
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,892
The Broad Broad:
Tips and Tricks

194
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,261
From the Football Field
to the Runways of Paris.

195
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,231
Forget about proportionizing,
it's about shoulderizing.

196
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,232
[laughs]

197
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,167
[RuPaul] Touchdown.

198
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,668
Go get my new book,

199
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,738
Eat It: The Chronicles
of the Buffet, Honey.

200
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:00,106
[all laugh]

201
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,808
You've got to know
how to have your food

202
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:02,909
and how to get it ready, bitch.

203
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,144
[laughs]

204
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:07,080
I shipped a copy of this book
to Monique,

205
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,716
but she says she don't rub
the big bitches no more,

206
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,484
so fuck you,
you skinny bitch.

207
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,319
[all laugh]

208
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,358
I wrote this book due to
the fact that I was hungry.

209
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,959
[all laugh]
Girl.

210
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,594
[RuPaul] I don't think
the Food Network

211
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,396
is ready for this jelly.

212
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,098
From Bitter to Glitter:

213
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:28,168
The Story of How Cross-Dressing
Changed my Life.

214
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,437
My three best pieces
of advice are:

215
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,338
Lie on your resumé.

216
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,873
Sleep with your boss.

217
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,909
After parties
are the new job fairs.

218
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,043
[all laugh]

219
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:41,080
Hillary Clinton called it
sad, but true.

220
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,148
[laughs]

221
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,983
[RuPaul] Okay. Oh, yes, churl.

222
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,719
Oh, my God, you're like
a slutty J.K. Rowling.

223
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,421
[all laugh]

224
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,290
Well done, ladies.

225
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,558
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

226
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:54,727
But one of your books
drove me Oscar Wilde.

227
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,962
[all laugh]

228
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,298
The winner of today's
mini challenge is...

229
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,836
Silky Nutmeg Ganache, Ph.D.

230
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,038
[cheers and applause]

231
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:09,242
You've won a $1.000 credit
from Postmates.

232
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,511
Oh, yeah.
[doorbell rings]

233
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,146
Oh, they're here now.

234
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:17,951
[cheers and applause]

235
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,186
Oh, look, it's the
hardest-working queen

236
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,355
in show business,
Morgan McMichaels.

237
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,691
Ah, body.

238
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,626
Listen, I love Postmates.

239
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,295
-Why do you do it?
-I do it for the tips.

240
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,298
You know, I've always relied
upon the kindness of strangers.

241
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,400
Yes, I've heard.

242
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,035
[all laugh]

243
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,004
Well, I gotta go back to work.

244
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,106
-Bye.
-Bye.

245
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,407
Oh, Morgan.

246
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,409
Haven't you forgotten
something, darling?

247
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,580
[pop]

248
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,951
[all laugh]

249
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,287
I was wondering
where I left this.

250
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,388
[all laugh]

251
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,791
Ladies,
it's that time of year,

252
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,594
and I sure hope your
charisma, uniqueness,

253
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:04,197
nerve, and talent floats,

254
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:09,168
because this season we're
playing the Snatch Game at Sea.

255
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,870
[cheers and applause]

256
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,071
Oh, my God.

257
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,141
Brought to you
by our friends at Vacaya,

258
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,212
a fresh new approach
to LGBT+ travel.

259
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:23,616
With amazing destinations,
stellar entertainment,

260
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,652
and world-class hospitality.

261
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,489
Now, landlubber rules
still apply.

262
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:31,624
You need to impersonate
a celebrity,

263
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,128
play the game,
and make us laugh.

264
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:40,533
Gentlemen, start your engines,
and may the best woman win.

265
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,503
[cheers and applause]

266
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:46,339
Bitch! I've made it
to the Snatch Game.

267
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,674
If you don't do good, bitch,

268
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,576
everybody's going to remember
your Snatch Game,

269
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,311
ain't no ifs, ands, or buts.

270
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,946
Whatever you do
is going to follow you

271
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,914
like the shadow
followed Peter Pan,

272
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,184
and haunt you
till death do you part.

273
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,023
When I curl synthetic hair,
does it go on a low setting?

274
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,225
[Plastique]
The lowest setting possible.

275
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,927
Our challenge today
is Snatch Game,

276
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,495
and I cannot wait.

277
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,730
I'm so excited.

278
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,965
This is your strength, though.

279
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,199
-I'm so excited for you.
-I hope so.

280
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,034
I hope it's my strength.

281
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,803
I don't want to jinx myself.

282
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,904
It's going to be fun.

283
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,072
This is a celebrity
impersonation.

284
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,206
The whole goal of this

285
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,507
is to be in character,
have fun,

286
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,176
and make Ru laugh.

287
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,677
I'm gonna curl this hair.

288
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,045
[Yvie] Who are you thinking
about doing, girl?

289
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,983
I'm going to do something
for my Latinos out there, Charo.

290
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:31,985
-Charo.
-Yes.

291
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,786
-La-cuchi-cuchi.
-[laughs]

292
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,321
-Who you doing?
-Tiffany Haddish.

293
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,390
-Is she from Girls Trip?
-Yeah.

294
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,692
The one that was ready
to cut her bra if she needed to.

295
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,693
Yeah.

296
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,730
♪ She read, aah ♪

297
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,264
-Oh, my snatch.
-The tricks, bitch.

298
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,004
Impersonations are not exactly
my strongest suit.

299
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,739
I'm freaking out a little bit.

300
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,107
Or a lot bit.

301
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,976
-Hi, boo-boo.
-Hey.

302
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,745
-How are you?
-What's up?

303
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:02,682
I'm just--I don't really do
a lot of characters ever,

304
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:07,754
and so it just feels
like a mental block.

305
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,023
It's just like...

306
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,424
Sucks.

307
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,660
Brooke Lynn is looking at me
with those googly eyes,

308
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,462
and she's shook, 'cause
she doesn't think of herself

309
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,730
as a funny queen.

310
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,865
Who you gonna do?

311
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,066
I think I'm gonna do
Celine Dion.

312
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:21,934
-Celine Dion.
-Yeah.

313
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,269
Is that your final answer?

314
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,140
[both laugh]

315
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,775
Last time
I had to do a character,

316
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,443
it was Rosie...

317
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:31,644
-O'Donnell.
-O'Donnell.

318
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,880
I was gonna say Rosie Parks.
Rosie O'Donnell.

319
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,348
You know that was not
my jush, either.

320
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,749
I don't really do characters.

321
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:39,352
Just be--you know,
make them laugh.

322
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,420
Just don't
freak yourself out before.

323
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,721
Yeah.

324
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,689
Make them laugh, bitch,

325
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,890
even if you're not doing Celine

326
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,325
and you're doing Snoop Dogg
or whoever.

327
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,827
While I'm telling her, bitch,
I'm telling myself, too.

328
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,862
[sighs]

329
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,664
Bitch, count to 25.

330
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,032
If not 30.

331
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,368
My ass had to count
to 40 the other night.

332
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,636
And that didn't even
leave me nowhere.

333
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,504
Don't freak yourself out.

334
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,939
Come back later.

335
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,776
Hey, cysts.

336
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,379
We've got company.

337
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,881
[screams]

338
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,616
Yes! Jinkx Monsoon is here.

339
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:14,420
Oh, you all look
absolutely fantastic, honestly.

340
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,855
[all laugh]

341
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,191
Jinkx won Season 5
of Drag Race,

342
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,692
and she's in the history books

343
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,962
for being one of the most
amazing Snatch Game winners

344
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,097
as Little Edie.

345
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:25,198
The label is faded.

346
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,766
I can never tell if it's paté

347
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:28,267
or if it's giblets
for the cats.

348
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,802
[laughs]

349
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,805
[RuPaul] Now, Jinkx Monsoon
is here

350
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,575
to help you get shipshape
for the Snatch Game.

351
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,211
Who's our first victim?

352
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,615
Dr. Silky Ganache,
meet Jinkx Monsoon.

353
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:43,883
-Hi.
-Hello, Jinkx.

354
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,184
-How are you?
-Nice to meet you.

355
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,619
I'm wonderful.
How are you?

356
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,354
Oh, I'm wonderful now, honey.

357
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,289
So now please tell me

358
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,760
you're going to be doing
Oprah's second cousin Cornetia.

359
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,762
-[laughs]
-Cornetia Winfrey.

360
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,963
Is that what you're doing?

361
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,964
Very similar.

362
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,565
-Well, who is it?
-Ts Madison.

363
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,868
-You're doing Ts Madison?
-Yes.

364
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,903
What a great choice for you.

365
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,371
Welcome to my chateau.

366
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,974
Yeah.

367
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:11,177
She quits porn, so now
like a social media mogul,

368
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,112
and she's everywhere
doing everything.

369
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,580
Are you worried at all about--

370
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,616
-No.
-[laughs]

371
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,951
I think she gonna love me, and
I'm gonna become best friends,

372
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,586
and we gonna have a good time.

373
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,122
Now, Jinkx knows a thing or two
about Snatch Game.

374
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,123
Do you have any questions
for her?

375
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,324
I got a question for you.

376
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,325
Mm-hmm.

377
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,332
Can I get your phone number?

378
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,935
Aah!
[all laugh]

379
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,870
Dr. Ganache, I just never know

380
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,572
what's going to come out
of your mouth.

381
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,741
And that's a good quality
for Snatch Game,

382
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:42,875
because you've gotta
keep it fresh.

383
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:43,943
You've gotta keep it funny.

384
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,044
Absolutely.

385
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,546
You've got
such a big personality.

386
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:50,650
And you filter that through
Ts Madison and you're golden.

387
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,985
You know I'm gonna give you
everything, plus a little more.

388
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,187
[RuPaul] You better.

389
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:55,488
Listen, can't wait
to see you out there.

390
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,323
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, Dr. Ganache.

391
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,294
Oh, my wig.

392
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,229
Yvie Oddly.

393
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,832
Now, I see sort of
a dreadlock wig here.

394
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,700
Are you going to do
Whoopi Goldberg?

395
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,435
I am gonna do Whoopi Goldberg.

396
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,037
Is this a strong character
for you?

397
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,973
I don't do impersonations
very well.

398
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,442
What would you say
your biggest strength is?

399
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,412
I won the first acting challenge
that we had.

400
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,247
-Yes.
-That's a good sign.

401
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,449
Last week you surprised us
with this glam look.

402
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,418
You looked really pretty.

403
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:29,155
I didn't realize that
I wasn't turning any of that...

404
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,356
[laughs] For y'all.

405
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,557
Oh, bitch, come on.

406
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,726
You know you were serving
freakazoid before.

407
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,429
[laughs]
This all sounds so familiar.

408
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,131
[RuPaul] Yes, that's right.

409
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,200
So if you've already won
the acting challenge,

410
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,002
you already know
what you're doing here.

411
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,338
So if you can get yourself

412
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,173
to where you've transformed
into Whoopi,

413
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,077
and then you use your own
natural wit and cleverness,

414
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,411
like I think you can handle it.

415
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,147
You're funny.
You're already funny.

416
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:56,716
So just make me
fucking laugh, Yvie.

417
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,817
Okay. Thank you.

418
00:16:57,817 --> 00:17:00,086
Thank you. Bye.

419
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,756
-Hello.
-Brooke Lynn Hytes,

420
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,291
meet Jinkx Monsoon.

421
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,628
You know, Jinkx
is a Snatch Game assassin.

422
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:11,097
Now, we're here
to guess who you're doing.

423
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,698
So don't tell me
because I want to guess.

424
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,900
I see a white jacket.

425
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,101
Sammy Davis Jr.?

426
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:16,903
[all laugh]

427
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,004
Celine Dion?

428
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,238
-Thank you.
-Is it?

429
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,306
You are doing Celine.

430
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,341
[Brooke Lynn] Celine, yeah.

431
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,776
Do you have Celine's voice down?

432
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,678
Because that's really
the most important part, right?

433
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,179
Yeah, the accent,
the French Canadian accent.

434
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,247
Uh-huh.

435
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,582
Yeah, 'ello, 'ow are you?

436
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,651
It's good to see you, Jinkx.
You look beautiful.

437
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,723
Um, she's trying.

438
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,625
-Do you feel good?
-I feel good.

439
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,297
My heart will go on.
Love you.

440
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:47,233
How about this. Celine,
what'd you have for lunch?

441
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,068
Poutine.

442
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,537
-Poutine.
-Poutine.

443
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,572
It's a French-Canadian delicacy.
You will love it.

444
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,075
It's French fries
with cheese curd and gravy.

445
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,643
It's amazing!

446
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,078
Hilarious.

447
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,146
-Really?
-No.

448
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,449
I--to be completely honest
with you,

449
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,751
I'm just not feeling
super confident about any of it.

450
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,553
I just feel like
I have a mental block.

451
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,654
It's just...

452
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,856
Sometimes also
an over-exaggeration

453
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:15,294
can make up for maybe you're
not the best at doing her voice.

454
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,929
-Yeah.
-I love doing Bette Davis,

455
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,297
but it's not accurate.

456
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,633
It's just me going, ahh...

457
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,436
ahh...as much as I can.

458
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,038
It works.
That works.

459
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,075
I see the worry in your eyes.

460
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:30,576
Can't wait to take a Xanax
after we finish.

461
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,244
[RuPaul] All right, all right.

462
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,579
-We'll see you out there.
-Thank you, Ru.

463
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,114
Come on, Jinkx.

464
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,449
I'm gonna die.

465
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:41,387
-Hi, Nina.
-Hi, Ru. How are you?

466
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,455
Meet Jinkxy.

467
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,756
-Hi, Jinkx.
-Hi, Nina.

468
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,792
So, now, Nina, you're
a comedy theater queen.

469
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,094
I am.

470
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,596
I would think that
if anybody in this workroom

471
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,199
knows what Snatch Game is,
it would be you.

472
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:56,469
I think so.
This is improv, riffing,

473
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,404
and it's knowing your character
and trying to make you laugh.

474
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,505
[RuPaul] Yeah, I love to laugh.

475
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,639
Which is really
what I want to do.

476
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,308
You know,
even if it's halfway funny,

477
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,809
I'll fucking laugh. True.

478
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,910
[all laugh]

479
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,679
I have brought--

480
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,014
I'm between
two different characters

481
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:10,116
who I think I can embody.

482
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,184
Is that Betty Rubble?

483
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,753
Close. Jo Anne Worley.

484
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,088
Oh, oh, Jo Anne ♪ Worley ♪

485
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,256
-♪ Worley ♪ Yeah.
-Yes.

486
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,792
And is that Eleanor Parker?

487
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,661
Close. [deep voice]
Harvey Fierstein.

488
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,496
-Yeah.
-Yes.

489
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,831
I'm trying to decide
really between the two,

490
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,701
and what's going to be
the best decision.

491
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,103
A lot of the kids
watching this show these days,

492
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,772
they're not going to know
either of these people.

493
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,774
-Right.
-Now you have to do it so well

494
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,443
that even though they don't know
who these people are,

495
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,644
they're going to laugh at it

496
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:39,945
just because
it's a good performance.

497
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,380
When I did Little Edie,

498
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,351
I had certain things that I knew
that I could always go to.

499
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,154
I could always go to the cat tin
and talk about cat food

500
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,990
and I could always say
her certain catchphrases.

501
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,459
But I also had to be able
to go on the fly.

502
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,194
So I had to be able
to just trust

503
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,596
that if I stay in character,
I could say something

504
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,065
that Little Edie probably
never would have said,

505
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,967
like she goes into
the voting booth in seizures.

506
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,603
Spelling? You know,
she never said that.

507
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,872
But it's a funny thing
that I did in character.

508
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,274
-And it's in her character.
-Yeah.

509
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,875
I mean, she would say that.

510
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:13,479
Listen, I can't wait to see one
of these characters out there.

511
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,947
And make me laugh.

512
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,382
-I'm gonna try.
-All right.

513
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,583
So nice to meet you.

514
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,884
Nice to meet you, too.

515
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,252
I'm torn between
these two characters.

516
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,654
I'm not sure
what I'm going to do.

517
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,988
But if I'm going to make
a bold decision,

518
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,323
this is where I need to do it.

519
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,059
[sighs] Now what do I do?

520
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,295
[RuPaul] Hello, Miss--

521
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:31,130
Vanjie.

522
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,865
Oh, Miss Vanjie.

523
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,867
[laughs]

524
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,635
So now I see a red wig here.

525
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:38,170
Is it Lindsay Lohan?

526
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,107
It's not Lindsay.
She was on Dr. Phil,

527
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:43,309
the little "cash me outside"
viral girl.

528
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,244
-Oh, yes.
-Danielle Bregoli, yes.

529
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,180
Well, what are you going to do
besides cash me outside?

530
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,482
It's just basically
acting like her.

531
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,151
I was going to address RuPaul
as Dr. Phil.

532
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,452
Stuff like that.

533
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,621
That sounds like
a goddamn laugh riot.

534
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,756
It's not funny talking about it.

535
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,258
It's funny acting, I guess.

536
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,960
You know what?
Everybody says that.

537
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,565
Because on your audition reel,
you had L.A. Toya.

538
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,734
Did you think about doing
Latoya Jackson?

539
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:09,835
No, I'm not doing
Latoya Jackson.

540
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,036
Why not?

541
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,571
Because I know
she's friends of the show,

542
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,473
so I didn't--and then I would
have felt like uncomfortable,

543
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,808
probably stepping over
those bounds.

544
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:16,876
Oh, please, bitch.
If you're doing it with love,

545
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,677
there's no disrespect.

546
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,380
I just--the most person
I would be able to for me

547
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,751
I feel like turning it out
when I'm on set would be her.

548
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,587
And her whole thing
is that she's a rebellious kid

549
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:31,423
who is--bucks authority,
is that the thing?

550
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,993
Remember, Detox playing Ke$ha,

551
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,061
took a pee on stage.

552
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,165
It was like, how are we supposed
to laugh at that, you know?

553
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,267
And Detox learned
a big lesson from that,

554
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,869
that like just going for
the lowest common dominator

555
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,038
doesn't always cut it
if you've got someone else

556
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,007
doing a sophisticated
performance

557
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:48,974
up against you, you know.

558
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,212
Now you done flipped the script,

559
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,014
got me over here,
don't know what to do.

560
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,082
I'm about to go back through
my luggages again

561
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,784
and figure out
what I'm about to pull.

562
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,553
No, it's up to you, honestly.

563
00:22:00,553 --> 00:22:02,421
It's just we're just questioning

564
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,857
your ability to make
this character come to life.

565
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,659
You've seen Snatch Game before.

566
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,860
[buzz buzz buzz]

567
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,563
You know what happens
on Snatch Game.

568
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,764
Make it funny.

569
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:12,965
Can you do a character
that's just that?

570
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,000
That already was
the funniest thing you did.

571
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,336
[RuPaul] Funniest thing
of the day.

572
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,771
Well, you decide.
Can't wait to see you out there.

573
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:19,805
[Vanjie] Okay.

574
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,273
[RuPaul] Thank you, Vanessa.

575
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,210
Bitch, I'm shook, scared,

576
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,012
panicking,
stand-still mannequin.

577
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,715
I don't know what the fuck
gonna happen now.

578
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,953
-Hello, Plastique.
-Hi, Ru.

579
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:34,987
Meet Jinkx Monsoon.

580
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,021
-Hi, Jinkx.
-Hi.

581
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,156
So good to meet you.

582
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,524
There's
an unaccompanied minor here?

583
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,692
[all laugh]

584
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,262
[Asian accent]
Hello. Good to see you.

585
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,497
Oh, my goodness,
are you in character now?

586
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,732
Yes, yes, I am.

587
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,100
[RuPaul] Who are you doing?

588
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,336
I'm actually going to do
Lovely Mimi.

589
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:51,971
She's on Love & Hip Hop.

590
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,372
She's like this nail tech
from Atlanta,

591
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,941
but she's like--
she pulls out an accent.

592
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,776
She jumps in and out
of that Asian character.

593
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:59,111
But how different is she

594
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,081
from the nail lady
you performed in the Wakanda?

595
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,583
She's a little different,
because like, you know--

596
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,285
A little different or--

597
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,586
A little different.

598
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,989
So she jumps in and out
of different dialects.

599
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,390
What's her other dialect?

600
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,659
-Is she very 'hood, also?
-Yeah, she's very 'hood.

601
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,895
Can I hear a little bit
of your 'hood voice?

602
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,097
Where you wanna go
to lunch?

603
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,898
Lady Bunny's Glory Holes.

604
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,735
Well, it feels like you've got

605
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,470
one half of this character down.

606
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,904
[RuPaul] Yeah.

607
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,640
But it kind of sounds like
you've done it before.

608
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,341
Are you a one-trick pony?

609
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:32,411
I've done it before,
but I stick to my guns.

610
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,046
I know that
I can do this really well.

611
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,347
I know that I can do the accent.

612
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,116
This is actually my drag voice.

613
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,286
[laughs] The accent
is actually my real voice.

614
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,186
Yeah.

615
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,928
Your challenge
is to not be exactly like

616
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,464
Why it Gotta Be Black?
and also make me laugh.

617
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,599
Yes.

618
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,301
Plastique already
did this character

619
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,635
in Why it Gotta Be Black,
Panther?

620
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,538
Plastique did this character
in mini challenges.

621
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,974
Plastique has did this character
walking around the workroom.

622
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:05,444
I guess Plastique's gonna try
to do this character again.

623
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,180
All right, ladies.
Look, y'all,

624
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,481
I don't care how you do it.

625
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,551
You just better make us laugh.

626
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,086
Bon voyage,

627
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:18,657
and don't fuck it up.

628
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,026
[cheers and applause]

629
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,127
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

630
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,562
Shall we, darling?

631
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,098
-Thank you, Jinkx.
-Bye, y'all.

632
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:29,902
[Michelle]
It's Snatch Game at Sea,

633
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,603
brought to you by Vacaya,

634
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:35,574
a fresh new approach
to LGBT+ vacations.

635
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,543
How do you Vacaya?

636
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:41,180
Welcome aboard.
We've been expecting you.

637
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,717
Let's meet our Snatch Game
at Sea contestants.

638
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,453
Our first guest
loves escape rooms.

639
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:48,487
It's Clea DuVall.

640
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,356
-Hi, Ru.
-You look fantastic.

641
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:51,523
Thank you.
So do you.

642
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,392
Good luck
getting out of here alive.

643
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,194
I never want to.
[all laugh]

644
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:58,530
Now, our next guest
is obsessed with cruise ships.

645
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,966
Welcome Tony Hale.

646
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,801
Hello. I love cruises.

647
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:06,105
It's like a floating mall,
and the food feels free.

648
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,574
Well, there's
no shopping on this ship,

649
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:09,608
only mopping.

650
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,743
Bummer.

651
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,311
All hands on deck.

652
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,446
Let's meet our stars.

653
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,217
First up,
a social media maven

654
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,286
who has stepped her pussy
all the way up.

655
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,921
Ts Madison is here.

656
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:24,490
-Is it on?
-Yes.

657
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,758
Is it on?

658
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,594
The question of the day
and every single day

659
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,563
is this bitch recording?

660
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,599
[laughs]

661
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,803
Good morning, Baltimore.

662
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,906
It's Broadway's
Harvey Fierstein. Hello.

663
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,242
-I want to clear things up.
-Okay.

664
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:46,445
-I'm not Harvey Weinstein.
-No, you're not.

665
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,781
The only thing I've assaulted
is a cheese plate.

666
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,984
Yes. [laughs]

667
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:55,587
Now, all the way from
Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,

668
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:59,024
it's Instagram superstar
Lovely Mimi.

669
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:02,127
Hi, Lovely Mimi
in the house.

670
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,963
Hi, Mimi.
Would you do my nails?

671
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,932
Any day of the week, honey.
Come in.

672
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,334
I do the cuticle.
I do the extension.

673
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,969
-Everything for you.
-Oh, wow.

674
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:11,904
[Silky] Let me tell you
something, RuPaul.

675
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,105
Oh, what's that?

676
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,040
I let Mimi do my nails
in Atlanta, bitch.

677
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,843
I was the first bitch bitch
walking around Atlanta

678
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,211
with athlete's feet on my hands.

679
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:21,313
Don't you trust Mimi, honey.

680
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,448
Don't do it.

681
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,149
I will check you, ho.

682
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:26,018
This one's got two voices.

683
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:30,322
Next up,
she won an Emmy, a Grammy,

684
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,724
an Oscar, and a Tony.

685
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,193
It's Whoopi Goldberg,
everybody.

686
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:35,527
Hey, Whoopi.

687
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,362
You know, it's funny
that you should mention that

688
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,031
because I actually brought them
all here with me.

689
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,900
Oh, those are
all of your awards.

690
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,535
Yes. Trying
to get rid of them on eBay

691
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:47,739
since I haven't had a role in a
good five or six thousand years.

692
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,875
Aren't you on The View?

693
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,911
I am on The View, but after
interacting with these ladies,

694
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:55,814
something tells me I'm gonna
quit show biz altogether.

695
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,083
[RuPaul] All right, up next,

696
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,685
it wouldn't be a cruise
without her.

697
00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:01,386
My good friend Charo is here.

698
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,623
Hola, RuPaul.
It's so nice to be here.

699
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,024
Can I get one cuchi-cuchi?

700
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,861
Oh, claro que sí.
Oh, cuchi-cuchi-cuchi.

701
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:11,463
[all laugh]

702
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,733
Up next, we've got someone
that you know from Dr. Phil.

703
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:18,203
Problem child Danielle Bregoli
is here.

704
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,304
What's up, Dr. Phil?

705
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,607
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.
What's up, Ru?

706
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:24,243
Are you gonna behave here
on the Snatch Game?

707
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,744
-Fuck no.
-You're not gonna behave.

708
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:27,746
No. This fucker
is ratchet as fuck

709
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:30,082
and knocked my mom out
a few times.

710
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,517
I had to beat her ass,

711
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,951
and now I'm here
trying to get this check.

712
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,520
[RuPaul] Yeah, good, good.

713
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,922
Up next,
from the movie Girls Trip,

714
00:27:36,922 --> 00:27:39,858
the hilarious Tiffany Haddish
is here.

715
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,127
I hope you went to the ladies
room before we started the show.

716
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:45,164
Oh, there'll be no
golden showers as of right now.

717
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,266
[laughs] Tell me this.

718
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:50,068
Now, I know you became close
friends with Will and Jada.

719
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,937
-How they doing, girl?
-Girl, listen.

720
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,572
I had tried to take them
on a boat trip

721
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,507
that I had bought on Rupon--

722
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,742
'cause you can't say
the other thing.

723
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,310
[all laugh]

724
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,712
And girl, everybody wanted to
take pictures of Will and Jada,

725
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,415
and I just felt
so non-celebrity-like.

726
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,449
Oh, dear.

727
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:05,584
-But, girl, guess what?
-What?

728
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,252
I still got my Rupon.

729
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:08,687
[laughs]

730
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,989
She's calling it Rupon.

731
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,125
[laughs]

732
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,394
A'Keria as Tiffany Haddish
was spot-on.

733
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,262
Yes, ma'am.
Y'all caught that mug.

734
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:18,931
[RuPaul] Last but not least,

735
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:23,435
oh, my goodness, one of my
favorite voices of all time.

736
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,270
Celine Dion is here.

737
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,806
I'm a little bit confused.
I'm not sure why I'm here.

738
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,743
I thought this was a Titanic
20th anniversary reunion.

739
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,945
Oh, no.

740
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,079
I don't know
who any of these people are.

741
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,147
I know.
There is a nautical theme--

742
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:36,348
Is it Alzheimer's?

743
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:38,050
You got Alzheimer's, baby?

744
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,752
-No, baby, no.
-But you--

745
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,054
I have a show in Vegas, though.

746
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,555
[RuPaul] Let's see
how the show goes,

747
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,725
because it might end up
like the Titanic, actually.

748
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,194
All right,
let's play the game.

749
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,463
First question is for Tony Hale.

750
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,633
Bianca Del Rio is so mean.

751
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,836
Recently when someone yelled
"man overboard,"

752
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:00,172
she didn't throw
a life preserver,

753
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:01,273
she threw blank.

754
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,277
Another man.

755
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,979
-She threw another man.
-Yeah.

756
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,480
All right, let's go
to the celebrities

757
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,815
and see if you got a match,
okay?

758
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:11,583
Let's start with Ts Madison.

759
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,419
Bianca Del Rio is so mean,
she threw what?

760
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,054
I threw over a ruler, bitch,

761
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,990
to make sure
you had nine inches.

762
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,225
And if you didn't have
nine inches,

763
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,694
I wasn't saving you, 'cause
you wasn't worth anything.

764
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,197
Tony, you got nine inches
over there?

765
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:26,865
Ooh, we're not gonna go there.

766
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:28,000
[all laugh]

767
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,003
Let's move on down
to Lovely Mimi.

768
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,972
You know, Bianca Del Rio
is so mean,

769
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,942
she throwed the Ts Madison
at the man.

770
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,612
Girl, can you imagine,
she go overboard?

771
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:44,316
She go to the bottom
and die forever.

772
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,785
She just mad that her nails
are bad and I told everybody.

773
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,521
Okay, that's not a match,
but a very good try.

774
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,689
[audience] Aw...

775
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,891
Let's move on down
to Danielle Bregoli.

776
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,459
-What say you?
-Dr. Phil--

777
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,763
I mean, Ru, stolen credit cards
from her mama,

778
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:59,831
because that's
what the fuck I did.

779
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,767
-And I'm here.
-Okay.

780
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:03,402
All right.
Not a match, not a match.

781
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:04,803
Why you looking at me
like that, though?

782
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,338
No, it was close.

783
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,106
-Cash me outside, then.
-All right, all right.

784
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,307
Cash me outside, how 'bout that?

785
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,009
-I don't want to.
-Well, you're not angry.

786
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,411
-You're not angry.
-No, I'm not angry.

787
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:14,212
-All right, hey.
-What's up?

788
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,614
Hey, guys, it's gonna go down.

789
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:16,948
[Shuga] Vanjie
is messing with Tony,

790
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,552
and I can tell
that he is afraid, honey.

791
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,620
I ain't scared of you.

792
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,088
I whoop my mama.
I'll whoop you, too.

793
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,256
[all laugh]

794
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,425
Let's see
if the greatest voice on earth,

795
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,827
Celine Dion,
has a match for you.

796
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,495
I wrote the Heart of the Ocean.

797
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,964
That's the necklace
from the movie.

798
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,366
I am so angry.

799
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,501
It took them 20--it took them
100 years to find it.

800
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,236
-Yes.
-They got it out of the ocean,

801
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,504
and she throw it back in.

802
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,106
-She threw it back in.
-Yes.

803
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,076
Unfortunately for Tony,
that is not a match.

804
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:45,544
Celine Dion,
you have so many hits.

805
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:49,081
Is there one song in particular
that you love the most?

806
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,117
My favorite song to sing is
All Coming Back to Me Now.

807
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,752
Why?

808
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,987
Because the music
and the passion,

809
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,724
it just draws me in,
and I feel so alive

810
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,026
when I sing that song.

811
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,861
Where's the Celine?

812
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,696
It ain't even Celine Dion
anymore.

813
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,798
It's Celine You're-done.

814
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,668
All right, this next question
is for Clea DuVall.

815
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,503
Lady Bunny is so thirsty,

816
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:15,540
instead of portholes
in her cabin, she has blank.

817
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,310
[RuPaul]
What does Lady Bunny have

818
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,846
instead of portholes
in her cabin?

819
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,348
-Manholes.
-That's a good answer.

820
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,817
Let's go to our celebrities
and hear what they have to say.

821
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,519
Harvey Fierstein, what say you?

822
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,987
Well, I've known Bunny
for years.

823
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,322
She's a New York queen.

824
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,124
-I'm a New York queen.
-Yeah.

825
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:33,225
Gloryholes.

826
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,961
Judges,
is that same as a manhole?

827
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,029
-You need a man.
-Unfortunately not.

828
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,598
You do need a man for this.

829
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,533
But that is a very good answer,
Harvey Fierstein.

830
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:44,669
Let's go down
to Whoopi Goldberg.

831
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,004
What do you have?

832
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,207
I just wrote old movies
I had winning roles in.

833
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,377
Because there's really nothing
like enjoying The Color Purple.

834
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,379
In fact, my feet
are still dirty from it,

835
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:57,249
to be 100% honest.

836
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,984
[RuPaul] Okay, yeah.

837
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,253
Let's move on down to Charo,
cuchi-cuchi Charo.

838
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,554
Cuchi-cuchi.

839
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:04,222
[RuPaul] Charo,
what does Lady Bunny have

840
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,424
instead of portholes
in her cabin?

841
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,726
I said Mazola.

842
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,328
It is the oil for the corn.

843
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:14,266
But you put it in your skin,
then you can slip around in it.

844
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,067
You know, slip in your partner.

845
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,702
And then cook a taco.

846
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,404
And cook a taco.
That's a good answer.

847
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:22,174
Not a match,
unfortunately, Charo.

848
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,042
Tiffany Haddish,
we're looking for a manhole.

849
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,377
What do you have?

850
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,612
I said she has a little man
she can grapefruit.

851
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,847
See, what you do, Ru--

852
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:29,848
-Oh, oh, oh, oh.
-You cut the side,

853
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:30,849
and you cut the side.

854
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:31,850
What do you do with that?

855
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,085
Oh. [laughs]

856
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:40,492
All right,
so we're gonna do a bonus round.

857
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,394
Clea and Tony
will play together.

858
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,562
Here we go.

859
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,231
Nicki Minaj loves
going to the beach.

860
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:49,768
Her hair always stays dry,
but her blank don't.

861
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,472
But her...

862
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,308
Badonkadonk don't.

863
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,043
-But her badonkadonk.
-Don't.

864
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,411
Don't. Okay.

865
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,912
We're looking for badonkadonk,

[Yvie] Yes, queen.

1039
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,737
Are you busy?

1040
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,938
I can take a second.

1041
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,740
[Vanjie]
It'll be quick and easy.

1042
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,408
Come here if you can.

1043
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,210
It's not a good look,
acting like that.

1044
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,980
Not at this age.
No, ma'am.

1045
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,551
I wanted to apologize to you for
the way I behaved in Untucked,

1046
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,119
because you know I love you,

1047
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,888
and it was just like
a bad moment for the both of us.

1048
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,724
And we're like family.
Sisters are gonna fight.

1049
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,792
And like I don't take it--
like I still love you

1050
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,427
and I don't see you
any different.

1051
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,729
Thank you for apologizing.

1052
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,264
I'm sorry, too, 'cause, I mean,

1053
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:02,867
it really isn't cute
to be acting like that.

1054
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:06,704
And so I apologize for
snapping off at you like that.

1055
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,972
You're fine.

1056
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,241
And, bitch, I know like
after I was heated,

1057
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:13,745
but I was like, I'm sure
we'll be able to like make up.

1058
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,813
We like two pit bulls
going at it.

1059
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,582
She's somebody
that speaks her mind.

1060
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,484
I spoke my mind.
We sisters.

1061
00:40:19,484 --> 00:40:21,085
We're gonna be fighting.

1062
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,754

-I love you, too.

1063
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,622

-Thank you.
-No, thank you, bitch.

1066
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,794
Miss Vanjie is turning out to be

1067
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,230
like one of the most
genuine people I've met.

1068
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,432
I think her heart
is in the right place,

1069
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,501
and she doesn't just see me

1070
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:39,103
as somebody who's like
trying to take her down.

1071
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,473
Listen,
I just spoke to Yvie,

1072
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,777
and I know all of y'all
were in Untucked, you know.

00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,872
[Michelle]
Turquoise for the boys.

1208
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,207
[all laugh]

1209
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,344
[RuPaul] Call her Miss Ross.

1210
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:47,812
Plastique Tiara.

1211
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,714
Oh, I love a water feature.

1212
00:45:49,714 --> 00:45:50,982
[Clea laughs]

1213
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:52,316
[Plastique]
I'm super excited for this.

1214
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,086
Sparkling bubbles
all over my body.

1215
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,521
I look like an eel
freshly out of water.

1216
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,623
Feeling gorgeous.

1217
00:45:58,623 --> 00:45:59,824
[Ross] Icy what she did there.

1218
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,392
[RuPaul] Mm-hmm.

1219
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,861
[Michelle] Now where could she
be hiding her trident?

1220
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,895
[all laugh]

1221
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:06,697
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

1222
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:08,566
I've made some decisions.

1223
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,637
When I call your name,
please step forward.

1224
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,473
A'Keria C. Davenport.

1225
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,342
Plastique Tiara.

1226
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,846
Ladies, you are safe.

1227
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:26,417
You may leave the stage.

1228
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:27,518
Thank you.

1229
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:35,626
Ladies, you represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

1230
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:43,000
[RuPaul] Ladies, now it's time
for the judges' critiques,

1231
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,338
starting
with Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.

1232
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,306
I like this look.
It's a little Storm from X-Men.

1233
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,843
Vanjie, leotard and a cape
is what it is.

1234
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,479
At this point,
I don't know what else to do.

1235
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:59,483
It's just like
the same thing again.

1236
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,919
Is there
a lack of creativity here?

1237
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:03,354
[Ross] Or is there a look?

1238
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,122
Is there a brandable thing
she's got going on?

1239
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:07,692
Yes, and she did that
six times already.

1240
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:09,460
Now let's talk about
the Snatch Game.

1241
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,730
Now, listen, I've watched
so much Danielle Bregoli

1242
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,831
it's not even funny.

1243
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,800
You didn't embody her at all.

1244
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,035
You started out with
some weird Muppet voice.

1245
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,170
What's up, Dr. Phil?

1246
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,938
And then it just was you.

1247
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:22,206
Cash me outside, how 'bout that?

1248
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,608
The Meryl Streep of drag
you are not.

1249
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,010
Who dat?

1250
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,046
-Oh, from Devil Wears Prada?
-Ding-dong.

1251
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:30,414
[Clea] I don't know who

1252
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:33,117
the cash me outside girl
is really,

1253
00:47:33,117 --> 00:47:35,019
but you really made me laugh.

1254
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,387
Thank you.

1255
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:38,322
[RuPaul] Up next, Nina West.

1256
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,357
Your makeup
looks lovely tonight.

1257
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,958
Thank you.

1258
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,093
It's blended out.

1259
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:42,993
Your eyebrows
are in a better place.

1260
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:43,928
They're thicker.

1261
00:47:43,928 --> 00:47:45,162
You have that campy look,

1262
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,398
and it separates you
from the other girls.

1263
00:47:47,398 --> 00:47:49,633
What I noticed watching
the Snatch Game

1264
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:52,269
is that you made Ru laugh a lot.

1265
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,371
And then when you switched
to Jo Anne Worley,

1266
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:58,876
you chose an obscure person
who Ru happens to love.

1267
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,112
So it was a wise choice.

1268
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,114
And you got some
of the ♪ whoos ♪ in there.

1269
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,215
[laughs]

1270
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,950
Yeah, I loved
your bit with the cards.

1271
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:07,685
It was a lot of fun
to watch you.

1272
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:11,689
When Ru threw a ball your way,
you hit back every time.

1273
00:48:11,689 --> 00:48:13,023
That's how you win Snatch Game.

1274
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,960
Up next, Shuga Cain,

1275
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,164
in one of my favorite dresses
to ever walk down this runway.

1276
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:21,365
Thank you.

1277
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,834
That eggplant color
is just gorgeous on you.

1278
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,469
Aah!

1279
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,371
I mean, I'm allergic
to eggplant, but I don't care.

1280
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,006
I'll get an extra EpiPen,

1281
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,008
because I can't get enough
of this dress.

1282
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,911
Your Snatch Game was
really, really fun to watch.

1283
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:38,249
You did look exactly like her,
you sounded exactly like her.

1284
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,384
[Michelle]
I thought you did a great job.

1285
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,652
But you could have
taken it further.

1286
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:43,888
But I thought
every time you spoke...

1287
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:45,289
I said Mazola.

1288
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,758
[Ross] It was funny,
it was in Charo's voice,

1289
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,260
and you looked just like her.

1290
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,796
[RuPaul] Up next,
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1291
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:55,299
Wowa-wowa-wowa-wowa.

1292
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:59,837
That runway storyline,
we were gagging.

1293
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:03,841
You gave us Nomi Malone 2019.

1294
00:49:03,841 --> 00:49:05,442
Yes!
[all laugh]

1295
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,710
[Tony] It's going
to probably go down

1296
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,612
in like RuPaul history
of like great reveals.

1297
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,014
Thank God for that,

1298
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:12,082
because we're gonna
talk about your Snatch Game.

1299
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,318
I got the backwards suit,

1300
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:16,153
and I think
that's where it ended.

1301
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,589
I just got like a confused
realtor maybe from Toronto.

1302
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:19,824
What happened?

1303
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:24,428
I panicked,
and, yeah, I fucked up.

1304
00:49:24,428 --> 00:49:26,397
Canada called,
and they're pissed.

1305
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:29,099
[laughs]

1306
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,703
There is so much fun to be had
with Celine Dion.

1307
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:34,038
You know, she's so intense
about everything.

1308
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:35,105
You know, she--

1309
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:36,173
You just made her Italian.

1310
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,542
Shut up.
[all laugh]

1311
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:41,645
The accent wasn't there,
the jokes weren't there.

1312
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,783
It was a big letdown,
and I'm worried about you.

1313
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:50,020
All right, up next, Yvie Oddly.

1314
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,656
I think you look gorgeous.
Like this is such a cool outfit.

1315
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,025
And I wish that
I could pull anything,

1316
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,594
even one thing
that you're wearing off,

1317
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:57,895
but I'm too square.

1318
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:59,997
That jumpsuit is fantastic.

1319
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,466
So Ziggy Stardust.

1320
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,969
I love this hair on you,

1321
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,904
but that's giving me
like sixties girl group.

1322
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:10,507
But what I'm getting below
is like seventies glam rock.

1323
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,176
The head up and the head down

1324
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,878
are giving me
two different looks.

1325
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,346
Let's talk about Snatch Game.

1326
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:17,748
Whoopi's a good choice,
because we all know Whoopi,

1327
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,550
and there's a lot there.

1328
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,452
And you brought none of that.

1329
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:24,255
You could have even said,
"Ru, you in danger, girl."

1330
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:26,023
You could have had some clay

1331
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,491
and make believe
you were doing the pottery.

1332
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:30,761
Sister Act, Sister Act,
oh, my gosh.

1333
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,364
Even though
I had done my research,

1334
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:36,367
I got on that panel and I
just like forgot everything.

1335
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:39,370
I just think you overthought
a narrow part of her,

1336
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,906
and stuck too hard to that.

1337
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:43,874
That was a really big misfire.

1338
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,678
[RuPaul] All right.
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1339
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:50,547
Tonight on the runway
you look beautiful.

1340
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,884
The moment you opened your mouth
yesterday, I was laughing.

1341
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,986
[Ross] You always
look like you're having fun,

1342
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:59,723
and that just makes us
have so much fun with you.

1343
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,394
Something that you have that
a lot of improv players have,

1344
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:04,795
where there's
a "yes and" quality,

1345
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,130
and it's super fun to watch.

1346
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,433
Technically a couple ha-ha-ha
in Snatch Game.

1347
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:10,434
You get it. The hair.

1348
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,836
That wig, girl. Whoo-fa.

1349
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,805
It was chewed up by dogs.

1350
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,709
It was dragged
down Main Street, USA.

1351
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,277
Girl.

1352
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,447
-The 22 inches refers to?
-Her hair.

1353
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,250
Okay. I was
a little nervous to ask.

1354
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,818
[all laugh]
But, uh...

1355
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:29,320
That would be very long.

1356
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,555
Well, I don't have a lot
of experience with those,

1357
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,790
so who knows?

1358
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:35,426
[all laugh]

1359
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,428
Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

1360
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,930
While you untuck backstage,

1361
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,099
the judges and I
will deliberate.

1362
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,470
All right, now just between
us squirrel friends,

1363
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,006
I want to know
what you guys think.

1364
00:51:49,006 --> 00:51:50,874
Vanjie Mateo.

1365
00:51:50,874 --> 00:51:52,276
I like Vanjie.

1366
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,578
Every time she spoke,
I was thoroughly entertained.

1367
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:56,013
She made me laugh, too.

1368
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:58,682
Guys, Vanjie will make you laugh
just because she's Vanjie.

1369
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:02,086
But the Snatch Game,
she was Vanjie in a bad red wig.

1370
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,387
But I don't care.

1371
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:05,255
It's like you go
to a Julia Roberts movie,

1372
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:06,623
and you see Julia Roberts,

1373
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,726
and you're like, good,
'cause I love Julia Roberts.

1374
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:10,027
Vanjie's whole thing

1375
00:52:10,027 --> 00:52:13,764
is that she's hilarious
and authentically Vanjie,

1376
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:15,466
and she's bringing that
every week.

1377
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,034
That was not what
the challenge is.

1378
00:52:17,034 --> 00:52:18,736
I love the tension.

1379
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,504
One day we're just gonna
have passionate sex.

1380
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,506
Yes, you and me, Rossy.

1381
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,375
On a very special
RuPaul's Drag Race.

1382
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:26,543
[all laugh]

1383
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,345
Nina West.

1384
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,713
Nina just really exudes joy.

1385
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,181
She's got the opposite

1386
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,817
of like the person
who has a resting bitch face.

1387
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,486
Don't look at me,
because you don't have that.

1388
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,553
[all laugh]

1389
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,122
You're full of joy,
and I know that.

1390
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:39,556
[all laugh]

1391
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:43,660
Nina West in the Snatch Game
was one of my tops.

1392
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,063
She had a fully realized
character,

1393
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:47,898
and not only one, but two.

1394
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:52,169
Tonight was a very strong night
for Nina West.

1395
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,771
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

1396
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:54,972
Shuga Cain
with that gorgeous dress.

1397
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:57,508
That "merlot she better don't"
gown.

1398
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,376
-Mm-hmm.
-Absolutely gorgeous.

1399
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:03,414
In terms of Snatch Game,
how she sounded was spot-on.

1400
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,983
Shuga like loves Charo,
and you could feel that.

1401
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,552
[Michelle]
She, too, came prepared.

1402
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,287
But the difference between her
and Nina for me

1403
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:12,022
was she didn't take it
very far.

1404
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,491
You know, I would have loved
to seen her push it further.

1405
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,627
But Shuga has done very well,

1406
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:19,463
and she's emerging
in this competition.

1407
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,365
So it's a good, good night
for her.

1408
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,133
Brooke Lynn Hytes.

1409
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,302
We're gonna talk
about everything

1410
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,104
that's all
coming back to me now.

1411
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:28,939
[laughs]

1412
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,341
There was no Celine in that.

1413
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,210
It was all wrong.

1414
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,280
But then the runway happened.

1415
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,948
[RuPaul] Oh, goodness.

1416
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,349
Bitch!

1417
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,452
[RuPaul] That is one
for the history books.

1418
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:43,454
-Amen.
-It was so exciting.

1419
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,721
But here's the question.

1420
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,291
With her Snatch Game
being so terrible,

1421
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:49,326
is this enough to save her

1422
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,128
from having to lip sync for
her life and maybe going home?

1423
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:52,296
True.

1424
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,664
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

1425
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,132
Yvie's one of my favorites

1426
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:57,267
because she's
so specifically her.

1427
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,802
Every week, it's fun to see

1428
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:02,206
how she funnels the challenge
through her Yvie filter.

1429
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:05,175
And usually
it works out okay for her.

1430
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:07,811
This time,
she got in her own way.

1431
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,080
[Clea] There's
something about her

1432
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,949
that I find very interesting,
and she seems like

1433
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,684
she has a very specific
point of view.

1434
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:18,655
I don't know that that fully
came out in the Snatch Game.

1435
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,425
She missed almost
the entire essence of Whoopi.

1436
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:24,695
And after seeing
kind of the life and joy

1437
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,731
of kind of Nina and Silky,
it was like, whoo.

1438
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,734
Worst week yet for Yvie.

1439
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:34,238
[RuPaul] The Reverend
Dr. Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1440
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,440
You want to talk about
star quality, that kid's got it.

1441
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,876
-Mm-hmm.
-And Silky's star quality

1442
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,311
worked for her
in the Snatch Game as well.

1443
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,714
And it was so effortless.
She was really living in it.

1444
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:45,849
Every time Snatch Game
comes around,

1445
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,818
I look forward
to having that patter

1446
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,320
and sort of volleying
with someone,

1447
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,790
and I was able to do that
with our Silky Ganache.

1448
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,526
-Yes, honey.
-Silence.

1449
00:54:55,526 --> 00:54:57,694
I've made my decision.

1450
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:01,365
Bring back my girls!

1451
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:02,466
[all laugh]

1452
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:04,434
Ru, I want to hear that again.

1453
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,270
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

1454
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,238
I've made some decisions.

1455
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,042
Nina West.

1456
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:15,179
You're safe.

1457
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:16,246
Thank you.

1458
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,148
[RuPaul] Shuga Cain.

1459
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,851
You're safe.

1460
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,125
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

1461
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:33,096
Tonight,
Ts stands for Top Snatch.

1462
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:37,167
Con-drag-ulations, you are the
winner of this week's challenge.

1463
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,369
[applause]

1464
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:43,807
You've won a $5.000
gift certificate from Vacaya,

1465
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:49,446
which you could use for
a fabulous LGBT+ vacation.

1466
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,382
Book yours at myvacaya.com.

1467
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:53,584
Thank you.

1468
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:54,785
You may join the other girls.

1469
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,587
Thank you.
God bless you.

1470
00:55:56,587 --> 00:56:00,657
I am stepping over
Miss Yvie Oddly with my $5.000.

1471
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,094
How you doing?

1472
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,897
Brooke Lynn Hytes,
on the runway,

1473
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:09,866
you are queen of the world.

1474
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,971
But your Celine Dion
was a Titanic disaster.

1475
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,774
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

1476
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:25,549
Yvie Oddly, after that
Whoopi Goldberg impersonation,

1477
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,251
you in danger, girl.

1478
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:35,125
Vanessa Vanjie Mateo, your
bad baby was a problem, child.

1479
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,829
Vanjie...

1480
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,099
You're safe.

1481
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:49,373
[RuPaul] Yvie,
I'm sorry, my dear,

1482
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:51,174
but you are up for elimination.

1483
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:56,613
The bitch who called me
talentless is in the bottom.

1484
00:56:56,613 --> 00:56:58,382
[laughs]

1485
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:00,384
The bottom
looks nice on you, bitch.

1486
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:04,221
Two queens stand before me.

1487
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:08,025
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

1488
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:12,729
and save yourself
from elimination.

1489
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,600
The time has come...
[thunder]

1490
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,869
for you to lip sync...

1491
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:22,005
[echoing] for your life!

1492
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,542
I'm a fighter.

1493
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,144
I'm not going
to just die off gently.

1494
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,314
I really need to turn this out.

1495
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:31,782
This bitch
is not sending me home.

1496
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:38,155
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.
